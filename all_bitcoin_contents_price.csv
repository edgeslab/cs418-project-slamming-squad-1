Tether drama sparked bearish moves in BTC and the price tumbled below the main USD 5,350 and USD 5,220 support levels. The price even declined below USD 5,000 and recently recovered above USD 5,200. Similarly, there were sharp declines in altcoins such as ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, EOS, litecoin, NEO, ADA and TRX. The market turned red and it may struggle in the near term. Total market capitalization  During the recent decline, bitcoin price  settled below the key uptrend support at USD 5,350. It opened the doors for more losses and the price declined below the USD 5,220 and USD 5,150 support levels. The price even dropped below USD 5,000 before staging a decent rebound above USD 5,150 and USD 5,200.
However, the price is likely to face a strong resistance near the USD 5,300 and USD 5,350 resistance levels in the near term. On the downside, the main supports are USD 5,150, USD 5,120 and USD 5,000. Ethereum price  extended losses and even broke the key USD 160 support level. ETH declined more than 5% and broke the USD 155 support as well. 
It traded close to the USD 150 support and recently recovered above USD 154. On the upside, there are many hurdles near the USD 158, USD 160 and USD 162 levels. If there is a fresh decline, the price could clear the USD 150 support level. Bitcoin cash price  extended losses below the USD 270 support and tested the USD 265 level. BCH/USD is currently down around 3% and it is testing the previous support (now resistance) at USD 270. The next key resistances are near the USD 275 and USD 278 levels. On the downside, a break below USD 265 might push the price towards USD 260.
EOS  declined and tested the USD 4.50 support level. It is currently recovering above USD 4.65, but it is likely to face a lot of offers near the USD 4.75 and USD 4.80 resistance levels.
Ripple price  declined heavily below the USD 0.300 and USD 0.292 support levels. XRP/USD even broke the USD 0.288 support and tested USD 0.285. It corrected higher recently, but facing resistance near USD 0.295 and USD 0.298. There was a sharp decline in the past two sessions and many small cap altcoins weakened by more than 8%, including NULS, BAT, MKR, R, WTC, ENJ, OMG, NANO, GNT, ORBS, ARK, WAVES and XTZ. Out of these, NULS is down around 12% and BAT declined nearly 11%. To sum up, bitcoin moved down sharply into a bearish zone. If BTC/USD struggles to move back above USD 5,350, there is a risk of a fresh decline below USD 5,150 in the coming sessions, and altcoins are likely to follow the same path.

BTC/USD even broke the USD 5,400 level and traded close to USD 5,350. The price is currently (08:10 UTC) consolidating and seems to be struggling near the USD 5,400 level. Ethereum price too faced an increase in selling pressure and it recently tested the USD 160 support. Ripple was sold aggressively, resulting in a drop towards the USD 0.290 support area. Overall, the market is currently red and it could extend losses before it starts a decent rebound. Total market capitalization  There was an extended decline in bitcoin price  below the USD 5,400 support level. BTC/USD tested the USD 5,350 support and recently rebounded higher. However, the price seems to be facing a strong resistance near the USD 5,400 - USD 5,420 zone. The next key resistance is at USD 5,440, above which the price may revisit.
On the downside, the main support is at USD 5,350. If there are more losses, there is a risk of a drop towards the USD 5,260 support area in the near term. Ethereum price  managed to stay above the USD 160 support after yesterday’s decline. ETH/USD is currently consolidating and it seems like the price may test the USD 165 resistance in the near term.
However, if there is no break above the USD 165 resistance, the price may revisit the USD 160 support. Any further losses is likely to open the doors for more downsides towards the USD 150 support. Bitcoin cash price  found support near the USD 170 level and it is currently consolidating losses. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 280, above which the price is likely to recover towards the USD 292 or USD 295 resistance level. On the downside, the main supports are USD 272 and USD 270.
EOS  seems to be following a bearish path and it recently broke the USD 4.70 support level. The price tested the USD 4.55 level and it is currently down around 3%. If there are additional losses, the next stop for sellers could be USD 4.40.
Ripple price  extended decline and broke the USD 0.290 support level. XRP/USD even spiked below the USD 0.290 support and later rebounded above USD 0.292 and USD 0.294.

The past few hours saw additional weakness and many small cap altcoins dropped between 6% - 12%, including MXM, XTZ, DGD, BTS, PAI, INB, WAVES, DGTX, AE and GXC. Out of these, MXM is down around 11% and XTZ declined nearly 10%. To sum up, bitcoin is slightly under pressure near USD 5,400 and it could dip once again. However, there are many supports on the downside for BTC and it is likely to bounce back above USD 5,450 and USD 5,480 in the near term.

Apparently, his “imminent” extradition request to the United States means his attorney believes revealing Nakamoto’s identity would currently be too dangerous for McAfee himself. “The US extradition request to the Bahamas is imminent. I met with Mario Gray, my extradition lawyer, and it is now clear <...> that releasing the identity of Satoshi at this time could influence the trial and risk my extradition. I cannot risk that. I'll wait,” McAfee wrote on Twitter. Additionally, he told Bloomberg that Satoshi is not thrilled about the outing: “I’ve spoken with him, and he is not a happy camper about my attempt to out him.”  Although very few in the community seem to believe him, they are still humoring him in order to debate the merits of having Satoshi’s true identity revealed to the public. “Wouldn’t this be a negative development? Unless [Satoshi Nakamoto] has passed away already…” tweets Tom Lee, another famous Bitcoin enthusiast and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors. “You've spoken well about the importance of privacy in the past, describing it as foundational to universal human rights. It's not clear how 'outing' Satoshi Nakamoto is consistent with those ideas, either for the individual concerned or in general,” adds A. Hannan Ismail, Senior Adviser for South-South and Triangular Cooperation at the United Nations. Additionally, many wonder how McAfee managed to unmask Nakamoto when so many before him failed. “People forget that I am a technologist,” he told Bloomberg. “I am one of the best.” But there is a silver lining: if what McAfee is claiming is true and he has indeed found Satoshi, at least McAfee additionally claims it’s not Craig Wright, commonly dubbed Faketoshi. The whole story was prompted by Wright serving legal papers to the individual behind the Twitter account @Hodlonaut and threatening to sue them for libel due to them calling him “Faketoshi” and a “fraud.” Partly in response to this, McAfee decided to go on a hunt for the real Satoshi. “My entire life I’ve been tracking people who are the best in the world, and hiding their identity,” he added. “Finding Satoshi was a piece of cake for me.”",-106.64000000000033,0

The fund is in a European jurisdiction and is under the supervision of Liechtenstein’s financial regulator. Valery Vavilov, CEO of Bitfury, said in the press release, “With this innovative fund, Final Frontier is providing investors with a novel way of accessing Bitcoin mining opportunities, creating financial opportunities and furthering institutional adoption of Bitcoin.” The fund invests in turnkey assets comprised of mining sites with some of the lowest electricity and operating costs globally that feature state-of-the-art Bitfury datacenters, according to the announcement. The sites are scouted and operated by Bitfury, it added. A spokesperson from BitFury declined to comment on the size of the fund. “With the Bitcoin price down significantly from its all-time high, yet institutional interest growing every day, now may be an opportune time to consider investing in Bitcoin mining,” said Imraan Moola, co-founder of Switzerland-based Final Frontier.  The timing also goes hand in hand with the profitability of Bitcoin mining. Cryptocurrency analyst Alex Krüger said on Twitter that the current breakeven cost for Bitcoin mining is somewhere between USD 3,550 and USD 4,350, while the price of the asset is c. USD 5,500 as of the time of writing, which brings profits at above USD 1,000 per coin mined.  The bitcoin mining operational breakeven for efficient mining operations currently stands around $3550. pic.twitter.com/gQrNYBcvLH Bitfury Group was recently valued at USD 1 billion after it raised USD 80 million in a “private placement” investment in November 2018. The company also holds a minority stake in Final Frontier, as well as providing hardware and end-to-end services for the fund.  Institutionals are already looking into ways to enter the crypto space. One of the popular ways this year seems to be through endowments: a survey recently showed that out of 150 participants, 94% said that they have participated in crypto-related investment activities in the past year. Out of those, 54% invested directly, while the remainder had gone through a fund.

However, barely a tenth of the respondents believe crypto will be used as a currency in the future.  The online survey, done through Google Surveys, included a total of 10,000 respondents, evenly spread over 10 European countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, and the UK. However, the profile of the respondents is unknown and it's not clear how many of the surveyed Europeans own cryptocurrency. In either case, respondents from Norway were the most optimistic ones, with 73% of respondents positive about the future of the industry, while 55% of respondents from France believe the same, putting the country at the bottom of the list. Still, this shows that in all the countries participating in the survey, the majority believes crypto is here to stay. The percentage of consumers who believe cryptocurrencies will still exist in 10 years’ time: In what form crypto will exist in a decade remains a mystery to most, as only 8% believe it will become a currency, while only 7% believe it will be used as an investment or security. Only Poles believe crypto might have more of a future as an investment or security than as a currency. The percentage of consumers who believe bitcoin will exist as an investment and security tool in 10 years’ time: Although the majority of respondents in each country believes crypto will be around in the future, the same optimism does not apply to Bitcoin itself. Italy is the most optimistic country on the list with 55% of respondents positive about Bitcoin’s future, while France is at the bottom with only 40%. A total of four countries are below the half line: France, UK, Belgium, and Denmark, while the others teeter close to the middle ground. The percentage of consumers who believe bitcoin will indeed exist in 10 years’ time: “The fact that Bitcoin is not generating as much support as other cryptocurrencies is in part a symptom of the market’s volatility, but is also a direct impact of the constant media attention that is associated to its volatility,"" Andy Bryant, COO at bitFlyer Europe, said, adding that this research shows there is much more to be done to demonstrate to consumers the benefits of and use cases across all cryptocurrencies more widely. “The next step is for the industry to better promote the benefits and use cases of cryptocurrencies to consumers, so that people understand how they will come to be used in society,” Bryant said.",-106.64000000000033,0

Now, the majority of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap are in the green according to CoinMarketCap. Leading the rally with a 5% gain at the time of writing is Bitcoin (BTC). The current price of $5,599 USD per coin is a new high for Bitcoin in 2019, and the bulls are excited. But the news gets better for Bitcoin fans because, as stated, the first Bitcoin golden cross since October 2015 has formed. A golden cross is a technical chart pattern that indicates a major rally is on the horizon. According to Investopedia: “The golden cross appears on a chart when a stock’s short-term moving average crosses above its long-term moving average.” So with this bullish signal, Bitcoin looks set to change to a “long-term bearish-to-bullish trend.” If it can close above the $5,500 mark today, Bitcoin could rally to $6,000 USD in the coming days. The Bitcoin golden cross isn’t the only signal to indicate a rally. Tom Lee’s Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI) is spurring on the positive sentiment also. Recently the Fundstrat Global Advisors founder stated that his company’s Bitcoin sentiment indicator recently touched a value of 89. According to his expertise, this means a “bull market is likely starting.” Lee noted that the BMI was over 50 throughout 2018 and has never appeared in a bear market. April has been a good month for Bitcoin price. Growing 35% already in this month, the Bitcoin golden cross now signals further gains to come. This growth spurt means Bitcoin is on track to have the best month since December 2017, when the Bitcoin frenzy was in full swing. >> IIN Blockchain Expanding: How JPMorgan Wants to Improve Banking As is usual with the cryptocurrency market, where Bitcoin goes, altcoins often follow.

Taking all the answers he has into account, it seems that they believe there’s an average chance of 71.2% this is true. Meanwhile, a long-awaited golden cross appeared in Bitcoin charts, indicating the bull market. A total of 20 people responded to Woo’s survey, out of which two had notable comments picked out by Woo: one is trading veteran Peter Brandt, who said, “50% chance BTC goes to USD 50k. 25% chance we establish a very prolonged broad trading range for several years. 25% chance we go to basically zero,” and the other was Jesse Powell, co-founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, who said everything can go to zero at any time. The others make up an interesting list that is more or less bullish in nature: ________ As reported, New York-based research and consulting boutique specializing in the digital asset market Delphi Digital, claims that the Bitcoin bottom occurred in the first quarter this year, as there aren’t additional sellers coming.  Also, Adamant Capital has recently published a report on what could drive Bitcoin’s price going forward, regardless of the direction it might take. ""While lower prices are still possible, Bitcoin’s fundamentals are gaining momentum. Embraced by Millennials, its ecosystem is developing at rapid clip, both as a decentralized bottom-up disruptive technology, and as an uncorrelated, highly liquid financial asset for institutional portfolios around the world,"" the fund said. Today’s rally also seems to be indicating a possible upwards turn for the cryptocurrency as it has formed its first bullish golden cross since October 2015 - a candlestick pattern that is a bullish signal in which a relatively short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. It usually indicates a bull market and is reinforced by high trading volumes - which are at USD 16.3 billion as of the time of writing, while the price of BTC has increased around 5% in the past 24 hours and jumped above USD 5,500.

However, he thinks that the most likely scenario is that Bitcoin will test USD 6,000, fail and head back down back towards USD 4,000.

Today, BTC/USD gained bullish momentum and broke the key USD 5,350 and USD 5,400 resistance levels to start a strong upward move. The price even broke the USD 5,500 level and tested the USD 5,600 level. Ethereum price is also moving higher and it is currently (08:10 UTC) trading with a positive angle above the USD 174 level. On the other hand, ripple price is currently trading flat above the USD 0.322 support area, but it could start to climb higher in the near term. Total market capitalization  After forming a strong support above the USD 5,250 level, bitcoin price  climbed higher above the USD 5,400 and USD 5,500 resistance levels. BTC/USD is up more than 5% and it recently tested the USD 5,600 level. The price is currently correcting gains, but it remains well supported near USD 5,480, USD 5,450 and USD 5,420.
On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 5,560, above which the bulls are likely to push the price above the USD 5,600 resistance level in the near term. The next key barrier is near the USD 5,680 level. Ethereum price  is slowly moving higher and it recently formed a decent support base above the USD 170 level. ETH/USD is up more than 3% and it could continue to rise towards the USD 177 and USD 180 levels.
If there is an upside break above the USD 180 level, the price could surge towards the USD 190 level. On the downside, the main supports are near USD 170 level. Bitcoin cash price  followed BTC and jumped more than 5% above the USD 295 and USD 300 resistance levels. BCH/USD even spiked above the USD 305 level and it is currently consolidating gains. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 300, below which buyers are likely to defend the USD 295 support.
EOS  is moving higher and it recently broke the USD 5.25 and USD 5.30 resistance levels. The price is likely to test the USD 5.40 resistance, above which there are high chances of a rally above USD 5.50. On the downside, the key support is at USD 5.25.
Ripple price  seems to be forming a decent support near the USD 00.320 and USD 0.322 levels. XRP/USD must surpass the USD 0.328 and USD 0.330 levels to start a strong upward move in the coming sessions.     The recent bitcoin price rise boosted many small cap altcoins, including DGD, XTZ, ICX, AION, ADA, ELF, AOA, NULS, VEST and XVG. Out of these, DGD is up around 17% and XTZ climbed nearly 13%. Overall, bitcoin price is gaining bullish momentum and it could revisit the USD 5,600 and USD 5,700 levels. If there is a downside correction, buyers are likely to defend the USD 5,400 - USD 5,420 support area. Likewise, altcoins such as ethereum, bitcoin cash, EOS, ADA and BNB are likely to accelerate higher.

All you need is the Bitcoin lightning network and crypto payment processing startup Moon. In time, the service will extend to many e-commerce sites also, not just Amazon. Let’s check this out. The startup announced today that any lightning-enabled wallet can now be used through Moon’s browser extension. Before this, the service could be used by connecting the browser extension to exchange accounts like Coinbase. According to Moon CEO Ken Kruger, it works like this: “[The extension] will pop up a QR code and it will have the lightning invoice, which you could also copy and paste if you can’t use the QR code for some reason, and you’ll be able to pay with your favorite lightning wallet.” Customers should note that Amazon has nothing to do with the Bitcoin payment. The conversion from Bitcoin to fiat currency is taken care of behind the scenes by an unspecified third party. Therefore, Amazon merchants receive fiat currency and never have to deal with Bitcoin, but the user gets to use Bitcoin as he/she so wishes. Kruger maintains that the lightning-enabled feature should work on almost any e-commerce site by 2020 as “there’s no direct merchant integration.” This is also regardless of whether that platform accepts Bitcoin directly. Aside from Bitcoin, Moon also manages payment channels, offering an interface for sending payments. As Kruger furthered: “We’re integrating with the Visa and Mastercard networks and we get a cut of the interchange fees that merchants pay every time they receive a credit card transaction.” >> Cryptocurrency Bear Market Wanes: Going through Accumulation Founded in New York last year, Moon is looking very promising. Born of a $100,000 investment, the company has already come quite far and is now looking for a Series A funding round in 2019. Further, the company is looking for “opportunities to help solve some of those usability problems” and to “engage with other folks in the lightning community to see what people are doing, what they’re working on and if there are any significant gaps.

Moon, a crypto payment processing startup’s service, announced that Coinbase users can shop on Amazon buy paying with Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash via the Lightning Network technology. ""Soon you’ll be able to shop on any of your favorite e-commerce websites, like eBay, Ali Express and Target,"" the U.S.-based company said on its website. Until now, beta users utilized Moon to pay with crypto on e-commerce sites, and they were able to do so by connecting the browser extension to exchange accounts such as Coinbase. However, thanks to Moon’s lightning feature, now any lightning-enabled wallet can be used through Moon’s browser extension, the startup explained. The extension’s Lightning Network support is pending Chrome Web Store review, it added. The company further stated that there are no fees for purchases made via Moon, that the payments are instant, that all data is encrypted, and that it is not a custodial service. Moon manages payment channels and provides an interface for sending payments. Meanwhile, after installing the extension, users are required to make an account. While making a purchase, they will receive a QR code from the extension, along with the lightning invoice, and they can pay with their lightning wallet of their choice. The extension will recognize the checkout process, and users just need to click “Pay with Moon” to complete the purchase. Not all e-commerce sites will accept cryptocurrency, which is why, through Moon, users’ bitcoin is converted into fiat and then transferred to the sites, though it is still unclear which traditional financial institutions will be doing the actual conversion. Meanwhile, other third parties have also started bringing cryptocurrency closer to other giants. Developer Sergio Abril launched Tippin, a new app for Chrome and Firefox browsers in February 2019, which lets users tip a certain tweet with Bitcoin via the Lightning Network.  Furthermore, Wuabit, a Spain-based independent startup, aims to launch a limited public beta of its crypto wallet for the popular messaging app WhatsApp this month, where it will be available through the chat interface, but also for other messaging apps such as Telegram, Facebook Messenger, as well as SMS, as Wuabit co-founder and CEO/CTO Manuel Polo previously told Cryptonews.com.",86.88000000000011,1

Later, BTC/USD corrected lower and recently tested the USD 5,150 support area. The price remains well supported on the downside and it seems like the bulls are sighting a fresh upward move in the coming sessions. Similarly, there was a downside correction in ethereum below the USD 170 support, but the USD 165 level acted as a strong support. Ripple price also corrected lower, but the USD 0.315 level prevented losses and XRP/USD recovered above the USD 0.320 level. Total market capitalization  Recently, there was a downside correction below USD 5,250 and USD 5,200 in bitcoin price . BTC/USD traded close to the USD 5,150 support area, where buyers emerged. The price bounced back and it is currently (08:10 UTC) trading above the USD 5,200 and USD 5,225 levels. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the USD 5,280 and USD 5,300 levels.
A successful close above the USD 5,300 resistance is likely to open the doors for more gains above the USD 5,350 resistance level. The main weekly resistance is at USD 5,400, above which the price may accelerate towards the USD 5,550 or USD 5,600 zone. Ethereum price  also corrected lower below the USD 170 support level. However, ETH/USD found support near USD 165 and it recently bounced back to USD 170.
The bulls need to gain traction above the USD 170 and USD 172 levels for a decent rise towards the USD 180 weekly resistance. On the downside, the main supports are at USD 165 and USD 160. A daily close below USD 160 might put a lot of pressure on the bulls. Bitcoin cash  failed to retain gains and declined sharply below the USD 300 support level. BCH/USD even broke the USD 290 level and tested the USD 280 support. The price is currently consolidating and remains at a risk of more losses below USD 280.
EOS  declined sharply below the USD 5.20 and USD 5.00 support levels. The price traded close to the USD 4.90 level and recently bounced back above USD 5.10. On the upside, there are many hurdles for buyers near the USD 5.20 and USD 5.30 levels.
Ripple price  trimmed most its gains and declined from the USD 0.340 swing high. XRP/USD broke the USD 0.330 support and tested the main weekly support near the USD 0.314 and USD 0.315 levels. The price recently rebounded above USD 0.322 and it could face sellers near the USD 0.328 and USD 0.330 levels. Despite bearish moves in bitcoin and ethereum, a few small cap altcoins moved higher by more than 6%, including DGD, BIX, FCT, REP, SC, MCO and NANO. Out of these, DBD rallied close to 12% and BIX is up around 8%. Overall, bitcoin is still trading in an uptrend above the USD 5,150 and USD 5,100 support levels. Only a daily close below USD 5,000 might negate the current bullish bias. If not, there are chances of more upsides in BTC and altcoins in the near term.

It also provided six reasons why the price of the number one cryptocurrency might correct lower and listed three drivers that might increase the value of the coin. ""While  lower  prices  are  still  possible, Bitcoin’s fundamentals are gaining momentum. Embraced by Millennials, its ecosystem is developing at rapid clip, both as a decentralized bottom-up disruptive technology, and as an uncorrelated, highly liquid financial asset for institutional portfolios around the world,"" the fund said.  Adamant Capital was founded by Tuur Demeester, a popular economist and bitcoin-investor, who correctly predicted the crypto market drop last year. Now, they assert that the long term risk-reward ratio for Bitcoin is ""the most favorable of any liquid investment in the world.""  ""We expect for it to trade in a range of USD 3,000 to USD 6,500 after which we foresee the emergence of a new bull market,"" the report said, without providing estimations how long the accumulation phase may last. They added that this phase in the previous Bitcoin bear market lasted from February 2015 until May 2016 when when BTC traded in the USD 200 - USD 400 range. So what could possibly move Bitcoin? ""Given that no one exchange today has achieved the market dominance of Mt Gox at the time, a similar shock is unlikely. However, we still see exchange hacks or failures as the most important source of potential negative demand shocks for Bitcoin in the coming 6 months."" ""<...> we don’t see a financial crisis as a long term headwind for Bitcoin, on the contrary. <...> we believe that Bitcoin is of compelling value for investors looking to diversify their portfolios for protection against tail risks in both global bond and global stock markets."" ""Because of their large turnover and capacity to hold or sell coins, Bitcoin miners have an outsized influence on the boom-bust cycles of the industry."" ""Given the pending litigation it is unlikely but still possible that the Mt. Gox trustee begins distributing the 140,000 BTC that it currently has under man-agement. A significant percentage of this could then be sold by the claimants."" ""Historically [it] been a recurring fear factor in the Bitcoin space. However, we don’t think this is a  significant factor today."" ""<...> [It] should  be  considered  a  permanent  risk factor, given the disruptive nature of Bitcoin. Nevertheless, no serious pro-posals have been made in that regard.""
____ New solutions help Bitcoin to strengthen its positions as a lightweight, robust, and universally accessible protocol. ""As it matures, we expect for Bitcoin to disrupt the USD 100 trillion investment vertical of Liquid Store of Value, and become a globally used digital gold and reserve asset."" ""<...> surveys suggest that the majority of Bitcoin buyers are also Millennials, with mistrust of gov-ernments and growth outlook as the main motivations to buy. As the disposable income of Millennials continues to grow, we expect further tailwinds in terms of Bitcoin adoption and price appreciation.""
____ Also, Adamant Capital claims that supported by over 10 years of infrastructure development, the stage is set for mass market adoption in the coming 5 years.  ""In our assessment, during this phase (its “Windows moment”) Bitcoin will become widely recognized as a portfolio hedging instrument and reserve asset, and will begin making significant inroads as a payment network,"" they concluded.

""Maybe crypto-bull contingents should consider what happens after the bubble - not every bubble that bursts recovers the old highs,"" Kevin Dennean wrote in his research note, according to Business Insider. Bitcoin reached its all-time high of almost USD 20,000 in December, 2017, but today, it’s 74% down from that number. According to the analyst, despite some Bitcoin bulls expect that the most popular cryptocurrency ""is ready to rise phoenix-like from the ashes just as other assets and indices did in the past"", it might take longer than many estimate.  Out of the examples Dennean gives in his note, all the asset classes (stocks, oil) collapsed by more than 75% from their peaks, except for one, but including Bitcoin, while only two recovered to previous levels. It is not easy to estimate how long it will take for Bitcoin to retrace its all-time highs, but presumably it will not be any time soon, according to Dennean: “We're struck by how long it took other asset bubbles to recover their peak levels (as long as 22 years for the Dow Jones Industrials) and how pedestrian the annualized returns from trough to recovery often are.” Decades later, some asset classes have still not recovered, the report said. Meanwhile, the crypto-Twitter has reacted enthusiastically to this news, not doubting Bitcoin’s recovering abilities, claiming that the analyst ""will be humbled"", according to Twitter user @mBTCPizpie. ""Make it 22 months!"" replies user @BTCradar. Others responded with good-natured humor to the idea of waiting several decades for Bitcoin to recover, posting memes - as people have come to expect, such as the “It’s been 84 years” Titanic meme, the “Ain’t nobody got time for that” meme, and a great many skeleton memes.   pic.twitter.com/6d9mF7Nn4Z Meanwhile, among the recent forecasters is trading veteran Peter Brandt, who correctly predicted the bear market of 2018, and now estimates that Bitcoin might reach USD 50,000 within the next two years.  Also, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of popular cryptocurrency trading platform BitMEX, has recently predicted that Bitcoin will more than double and reach USD 10,000 per coin this year. However, despite Bitcoin is up by almost 40% this year, Vinny Lingham, general partner at crypto fund Multicoin Capital and co-founder & CEO of Civic, an identity protection and management startup, said in April that the recent rally may very well be just another bounce before the next possible dip below USD 3,000.",46.910000000000764,1

BTC remained well supported and recently climbed above the USD 5,100 and USD 5,140 resistance levels. The price even broke the USD 5,200 level and it is currently (08:10 UTC) correcting gains. Similarly, there was an upward move in ethereum above the USD 162 and USD 165 resistance levels. Ripple also rebounded and climbed back above the USD 0.320 resistance. Going forward, there could be a short term downside correction, but the crypto market is likely to bounce back. Total market capitalization  There was a steady rise in bitcoin price  above the USD 5,100 resistance area. BTC bulls managed to push the price above the USD 5,140 and USD 5,200 resistance levels. The price traded close to the USD 5,250 level and it is correcting lower. An initial support is at USD 5,160 and USD 5,140, below which the price could test USD 5,100.
On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 5,220, above which the price is likely to revisit the USD 5,250 resistance area. The next key resistance is at USD 5,320. Ethereum price  climbed higher after testing the USD 155 support. ETH recently broke the USD 163 and USD 165 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. It struggled to clear the USD 168 resistance and currently consolidating near USD 165.
On the downside, a break below the USD 165 support may push the price towards the USD 163 level. On the upside, the main hurdle for buyers is near the USD 170 level. Bitcoin cash price  climbed higher towards the USD 330 level recently and later retreated to USD 310. BCH/USD is trading in a range, with a strong support at USD 300. On the upside, there are many resistances near the USD 320 and USD 330 levels.
EOS  rebounded above the USD 5.40 level and tested the key resistance at USD 5.50 and USD 5.55, where sellers emerged. The price is moving lower towards the USD 5.40 and USD 5.35 support levels.
Ripple price  corrected higher and cleared the USD 0.315 and USD 0.320 resistance levels. XRP/USD even tested the USD 0.324 level and it is currently trading near the USD 0.321 level. On the downside, the key support is at USD 0.320, and resistance on the upside is near USD 0.324 and USD 0.325. In the past three sessions, many small cap altcoins recovered and climbed by more than 8%, including BIX, HOT, BAT, XTZ, WAX, CRO, KMD and NANO. Out of these, BIX is up around 13% and HOT climbed close to 12%. Clearly, the recent upward move in bitcoin pushed the price into a positive zone USD 5,140. BTC bulls now have to gain strength above USD 5,200 and USD 5,220 to push the price further higher towards the USD 5,320 level.

(Updated on April 17, 07:18 UTC: section ""That was easy"" has been updated.) A cryptic message broadcasted to the Blockstream satellite on April 13th was the challenge for all would-be players to participate in “Satoshi’s Treasure,” described as a contest to “test the resolve, courage, intelligence, and savvy of would-be hunters.” Received a new message over @Blockstream Satellite. It appears to be a treasure hunt for $1,000,000 in #bitcoin, with included GPS coordinates for the first part of the hunt! 🤯🛰️🔎🗺️ https://t.co/M4mKMbQ8KU pic.twitter.com/HzkEJ8RFXc A total of 1,000 fragments of the private key are hidden around the world, and at least 400 of those are needed to move the funds. Players can team up, organize hunts, and even sell their key fragments - there are almost no rules, and the ones that do exist even come down to common sense. The rules promise that the keys will not be hidden inside private property, and that Hunters should under no circumstances enter those areas if they have not been invited. They will also not require any destruction of property, and should a Hunter consider destroying a Key to prevent others from finding it, the creator promises to reveal all the keys this Hunter holds to everyone, thus disqualifying them. A total of 20 people participated in creating the game. One of them is Eric Meltzer, co-founder of venture investment firm Primitive Ventures, who also donated part of the loot. He was joined by Ian Miers, co-creator of privacy coin Zcash, and 18 other unnamed contributors in creating the game - all in order to ensure that none of them know all of the locations of the loot. The rest of the loot was capped off by an anonymous angel investor. The first clue seems to point towards satellites: “These locations can be discovered by monitoring the output of the primitive orbitals known in your time as GALAXY18, EUTELSAT 113, TELSTAR 11N, and TELSTAR18V at 1PM EST, APRIL 14th in the year 2019,” the clue reads. It goes on to add, “This is not history's first great hunt, nor its last, but it is MINE, and so it is to me that you must prove yourself. I have devised a series of puzzles and challenges of increasing difficulty; they will test even the most resourceful hunter or clan.” ""The response [to the first clue] has been absolutely overwhelming. People showed up to the 10 spots we indicated around the world where keys would appear en masse—some drove over 3 hours to get to a spot. Others figured out how to brute force the encryption we used and solved the clues without having to travel (something which we hoped would happen, but thought would take weeks—in reality it took 30 minutes..),"" Meltzer said in the Proof of Work newsletter.  According to him, people are forming teams, talking strategy, speculating on the value of keys and where the next clues will show up: ""Subreddits are being created. Telegram groups are forming. Our poor mongoDB is getting hammered with signups."" Meanwhile, GitHub (a platform for software developers) user John Cantrell revealed how he obtained the first three key shards in a few minutes.  ""I was shocked! That was easy,"" he said at the end of the detailed and technical explanation. Other clues will be revealed at noon PST (UTC-8) on Sundays and anyone interested in participating is free to sign up for notifications. Meltzer told news publication CoinDesk that they’re also considering an app to help players keep track of everything, but that it will not be required to play. According to him, most of the participants are very young, and a number of them are minors. Happy hunting!",168.98000000000047,1

However, the previous support near USD 4,950 acted as a strong buy zone once again. The price bounced back above USD 5,000 and it is currently (08:10 UTC) trading near USD 5,050. Similarly, ethereum and ripple extended losses and tested the USD 155 and USD 0.312 support respectively. Recently, both ETH and XRP recovered, but bulls seem to be facing a lot of hurdles on the upside. Total market capitalization  There was a downside extension in bitcoin price  below the USD 5,050 and USD 5,000 support levels. BTC dropped towards the key USD 4,950 support area, where bulls protected further declines. Later, the price rebounded above USD 5,000 and even tested the USD 5,050 level.
On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 5,100, above which the price is likely to struggle near USD 5,140. On the downside, the USD 5,000 and USD 4,950 supports are important, below which the price could decline to USD 4,860. Ethereum price  accelerated losses below the USD 160 support level and tested the next support at USD 155. ETH found strong bids and recently recovered above USD 160.
However, the price is facing many hurdles near the USD 163 and USD 165 levels. A successful close above the USD 165 level may perhaps open the doors for more gains above the USD 170 level. On the downside, the main support is at USD 155, followed by USD 150. Bitcoin cash price  rallied recently and broke the USD 300 and USD 310 resistance levels. The main reason was a sharp decline in bitcoin SV after a major cryptocurrency exchange, Binance confirmed that it will delist BSV. BCH may consolidate for some time before bulls attempt a push above the USD 320 level.
EOS  tested the USD 5.20 support recently and recovered above USD 5.30. The price needs to surpass the USD 5.40 resistance to revisit the USD 5.50 resistance area in the near term.
Ripple price  declined sharply below the USD 0.321 and USD 0.320 support levels. XRP/USD traded close to the USD 0.312 support level and recently recovered above the USD 0.320 level. On the upside, a break above USD 0.325 is required for an upside acceleration towards USD 0.330.

Out of these, BSV is down around 21% and LAMB declined close to 16%. Overall, bitcoin price rebounded towards USD 5,050, but it must gain momentum above USD 5,100 and USD 5,120 to continue higher. If it fails to climb above USD 5,100, there is a risk of a fresh downside in BTC towards the USD 4,950 and USD 4,900 support levels in the coming sessions.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has published a guidance on paying taxes on cryptocurrencies back in early 2014 and has not since updated anything, although the market has significantly evolved. For example, cryptocurrencies are not viewed as currencies at all, but as “intangible property,” similar to stocks.  Buying crypto with fiat is a non-taxable event, along with gifting the equivalent of USD 10,000 per recipient, or transferring coins between wallets. What is taxable, however, is the sale of crypto either for fiat or for other cryptocurrencies, exchanging it for a service (or, well, paying with it), mining, forks and airdrops, and receiving compensation in crypto (or being paid in it). For now, cryptocurrency traders have to track all their transactions that fulfill any of the above criteria and calculate the amount they owe the government. Additionally, airdrops are an especially difficult matter, as the US-based authorities have yet to agree on what they really are. Recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) implied that airdrops could constitute securities, although there is no monetary investment being made in them. They are also a sticking point for tax purposes, making up one of the six main questions that the IRS needs to answer to make the tax process simpler to follow. As Cryptonews.com recently reported, Washington-based crypto-focused research and advocacy institution Coin Center published a report with six basic questions not clearly addressed in the 2014 guidance. These include how to calculate the fair market value of cryptocurrencies, how to track cryptocurrency transactions they’ve made, and how people should treat airdrops and forks. The report also offers solutions to these problems, like letting cryptocurrency traders use tax lot reliefs that are available to stocks and some other securities, instead of having to go through the onerous task of tracking each transaction by hand and then calculating how much tax they owe on those.  Airdrops and forks are also addressed, as there is always a possibility that a user is simply unaware of even having received new tokens, and Coin Center proposes taxing them only when they’re being sold, instead of making them subject to taxation at the moment of receipt.  Although not paying taxes because you think, “What’s the worst that can happen?” is generally not advisable, it is a good idea to know exactly what might happen. If, by the end of April 15th, you don’t file your return or get approved for an extension, you will receive a penalty that generally starts at 5% of your unpaid taxes, according to American personal finance company Credit Karma. This is also the case if the IRS discovers you have underreported your income. The amount you owe also generates interest over time. According Credit Karma, “If you eventually file but it’s more than 60 days after the due date (either April 15 or the Oct. 15 extension deadline), there’s a minimum late filing penalty. For returns that were due this year, that penalty is USD 210 or an amount equal to 100% of the tax you owe - whichever is less.” The IRS remains tight-lipped on all things cryptocurrency, only recently tweeting that, “To avoid the late-filing penalty be sure to file an IRS return or request an extension, even if you can’t pay the full amount owed.” They have also not publicly replied to the Coin Center report yet, even though it was sent to them through 21 members of Congress, led by Representative Tom Emmer, who had also lent a hand to Coin Center in creating the report. In the official statement published by Rep. Emmer’s office, he says, “The 2014 guidance by the IRS failed to address fundamental tax questions, and repeated requests to the IRS for additional clarity have been made by a variety of entities. It also indicates that rather than providing clarity, the IRS has instead increased enforcement activities against taxpayers who ‘misreport’ their cryptocurrency transactions.” Moreover, Americans have lost billions trading cryptocurrencies last year, but they don’t seem to intend to report that, according toa survey, even though they could claim a deduction.",-100.21000000000004,0

BTC/USD even broke the USD 5,000 support before buyers appeared near the USD 4,950 level. Later, the price formed a decent support near USD 4,980 and slowly rebounded above USD 5,050 and USD 5,100 resistances. The price even broke the USD 5,125 resistance and tested the USD 5,175 resistance. Similarly, there was a decent rebound in ethereum and ripple above the USD 165 and USD 0.320 resistance levels. However, there many hurdles for buyers on the upside and any further gains won’t be easy. Total market capitalization  There was a solid rebound in bitcoin price  above the USD 5,050 and USD 5,100 resistance levels. BTC/USD tested the USD 5,175 level and it is currently (08:10 UTC) trading in a tight range. On the upside, there is a crucial resistance formed near USD 5,200. If there is an upside break above USD 5,200, the price could test the key USD 5,400 weekly resistance.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 5,050, below which the price may perhaps test the USD 5,000 weekly support area. Ethereum price  formed a strong support near the USD 160 - USD 162 area. ETH/USD climbed above the USD 165 resistance and recently tested the USD 170 resistance.
Buyers need to clear the USD 170 and USD 172 resistance levels to start a fresh increase towards the USD 180 and USD 185 resistance levels. On the downside, a break below the USD 160 level may call for more losses in the near term. Bitcoin cash  gained bullish momentum and broke the USD 290 and USD 295 resistance levels. BCH/USD is up more than 8% and it even broke the USD 300 level. At the moment, the price is consolidating, with support near the USD 295 and USD 292 levels.

EOS  jumped back above the USD 5.35 and USD 5.40 resistance levels. The price is up more than 4% and it recently broke the USD 5.50 resistance level. The next key resistance is at USD 5.60, above which the price may revisit the USD 5.80 weekly resistance.
Ripple price  recovered recently above the USD 0.315 and USD 0.320 resistance levels. XRP/USD even broke the USD 0.325 resistance before it faced sellers near USD 0.330.

Meanwhile, as reported, according to Vinny Lingham, general partner at crypto fund Multicoin Capital and co-founder & CEO of Civic, an identity protection and management startup, the recent rally may very well be just another bounce before the next dip.  There was more bad news to end the week on for the South Korean crypto-community. Cryptonews.com earlier this week reported on the reversal of the so-called kimchi premium – a phenomenon in 2017 whereby South Korean traders were paying up to 50% more than the international average for their tokens. In recent months, optimism has returned to the market as South Korean prices fell – meaning many were paying 1-3% less than global averages.  But per data compiled by Hanguk Kyungjae, the “kimchi bonus” may have been very shortlived indeed. South Koreans are now paying an average of 1.8% more for cryptocurrencies than users of overseas exchanges like Binance and Bitfinex. The same media outlet was positive about the outlook, however, stating, “The domestic market has been revitalized.”  However, Chinese are also paying premium these days. Elsewhere in South Korea, Bithumb – one of the country’s largest exchanges – has released the results of an audit following an alleged “insider job” hack worth some USD 13 million, said to have been carried out by disgruntled former employees. The company says an external auditor confirmed that no customer funds were lost in the raid. The auditor also seems to be convinced that Bithumb’s usage of cold wallets for customer funds is satisfactory. However, the company has taken a significant financial hit. Earlier in the week, a financial audit of the company’s operator BTCKorea revealed that Bithumb experienced a net loss of some USD 180 million in 2018 – a huge drop from net gains of almost USD 470 million in 2017. There was a silver lining, though, with Bithumb revenues actually climbing by 18%. The company is currently downsizing in South Korea, cutting its staff from over 300 to nearly half that amount, although it appears keen to continue expansion efforts into overseas markets.",28.340000000000146,1

BTC/USD even traded above the USD 5,400 level and formed a new multi-month high near USD 5,420. Recently, there was a sharp downside correction and the price declined below the USD 5,300 and USD 5,200 levels. The price tested the USD 5,100 level and it is currently consolidating losses. Similarly, there was a downside correction in ethereum and ripple. ETH traded below the USD 175 support and XRP declined below the USD 0.340 support area. Total market capitalization  After bullish continuation above the USD 5,350 level, bitcoin price  faced a strong selling interest above the USD 5,400 level. A new yearly high was formed near USD 5,420 and recently the price corrected lower. It broke the USD 5,300 and USD 5,200 support levels. 
Buyers appeared near the USD 5,100 level and the price is currently trading near the USD 5,130 level. On the upside, the broken support at USD 5,200 may act as a resistance. On the downside, a break below the USD 5,100 level might push the price towards the key USD 5,000 support area. Ethereum price  declined sharply from well above the USD 180 level and broke the key USD 175 support. ETH is down more than 5% and it is trading below the USD 170 level.
An immediate support is at USD 165, below which there is a risk of a downside extension towards the USD 160 level. On the upside, the USD 175 level could act as a strong resistance. Bitcoin cash price  failed to stay above the USD 300 and declined heavily. BCH/USD broke the USD 285 and USD 280 support levels. The price is down around 7% and it seems like it could test the main support at USD 265 in the near term.
EOS  traded close to the USD 6.00 resistance and declined below the USD 5.80 and USD 5.70 support levels. The price tested the USD 5.50 support level and it remains at a risk of a downside extension towards the USD 5.35 level.
Ripple price  is down more than 5% and it broke the USD 0.345 and USD 0.340 support levels. XRP/USD is trading below the USD 0.338 level, with supports near the USD 0.332 and USD 0.330 levels. On the upside, the previous support at USD 0.340 may now act as a resistance. In the past two sessions, many small cap altcoins corrected lower by more than 8%, including IOST, NULS, LRC, REP, WTC, STRAT, PIVX, AION, STEEM, ARK, ZIL, TRX and PAI. Out of these, IOST, NULS, LRC, REP and WTC are down more than 10%. The current price action is slightly bearish and suggesting more downsides in bitcoin towards the USD 5,000 support level. Once the current correction is complete, BTC price is likely to rebound above USD 5,200 and USD 5,250 in the near term.

According to CoinMarketCap, the total cryptocurrency market cap today is $182,807,737,820. As usual, when Bitcoin price is in the green, the rest of the market tends to be too. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is showing gains of a respectable 1.13%—a continued increase from a bull run now lasting over a week. Further down the chart, EOS is running away with a 6.84% increase. What has Bitcoin in the green as of late? The entire market is bullish so let’s check out why this is. At the time of writing, Bitcoin price is $5,285.08 USD, up 1.29% at the time of writing. Bitcoin has been on a bull run since April 2nd and not only has maintained the high but has continued to steadily increase. Over the course of a few hours on April 2nd, Bitcoin jumped from approximately $4,110 to $4,800. Now it has hit a current high of over $5,285. The rally has extended throughout the market with other coins also showing massive growth. For example, Litecoin gained over 50% and Bitcoin Cash roughly 80% in the same period. Two theories have emerged as to what caused Bitcoin to suddenly jump. The first is that $100 million worth of BTC was bought across exchanges Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp by one person. A sudden pump of money into the market spurred on further bullish sentiment, and the gains have continued. >> How Cryptocurrency Traders Benefit from Blockchain Technology Another theory is that because Bitcoin mining rewards will “half” in May of 2020, interest to buy BTC has sparked. The idea is to accumulate it now for the future when Bitcoin will be harder to mine and therefore become more scarce. As with any product, when it becomes more scarce, it becomes even more valuable. When mining rewards do halve in 2020, Bitcoin price can be expected to jump. So far in Bitcoin’s history ‘Halving’ has occurred twice–once in 2012 and once in 2016. What do you think? Do you have you a theory for the recent bull run? Featured Image: DepositImages © AntonMatyukha",120.44000000000051,1

BTC’s recent climb attracted Chinese investors, but they’re paying a premium price because they have to pay extra to purchase over the counter. China previously banned cryptocurrency exchanges from operating within its borders and also banned crypto trading. However, Chinese crypto investors have been using OTC platforms to access the cryptocurrency markets. The downside is that they have to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at a higher price than the officially listed market value. Some of the OTC platforms include Huobi and OKEx, among others. The recent surge in the price of Bitcoin seems to have revived the cryptocurrency investment appetite of Chinese investors, who have kept off the market for quite some time during the lengthy bear market. The return of Chinese investors to the Bitcoin investment scene has led to speculation that they had something to do with the surge. A cryptocurrency researcher called Anton Pagi stated that the Bitcoin surge happened after a notable uptick in trading volume on exchanges that have been associated with Chinese traders. Pagi even referred to a data analysis chart provided by CoinLib, a data analysis provider. The chart showed that there was a large Chinese fiat investment into Bitcoin and other digital currencies. >> Cryptocurrency Witnesses Better Returns than Equities This Year A news outlet called cnLedger revealed that Chinese cryptocurrency investors have recommended a ‘strong buy’ rating on Bitcoin. It also reveals that Chinese investors are using over the counter platforms as their main avenue of purchasing cryptocurrencies. Chinese investors are reportedly so confident about their bullish approach that they are willing to purchase cryptocurrencies at premium prices. There is a high likelihood that the average bullish outlook and premium Bitcoin purchases are behind the recent surge in Bitcoin prices. Chinese investors have thus been positioning themselves to take advantage of the bullish market. Featured image: Pixabay",-84.96000000000004,0

(Updates throughout the entire text.) Bitcoin mining has been included in a draft list of industrial activities the agency is seeking to stop, as they did not adhere to relevant laws and regulations, were unsafe, wasted resources or polluted the environment, the report said. The public can comment on the draft until  May 7. Chinese miners are major players in the Bitcoin mining industry. For example, at the time of writing, two largest mining pools - BTC.com and AntPool (both owned by Chinese mining hardware giant Bitmain) - hold almost 32% of the Bitcoin network hashrate, which essentially measures how much computing power is needed to maintain the network. Hashrate distribution If the new rules are enacted and Chinese miners will be forced to move to foreign countries, ""Bitcoin mining will no longer be dominated by China but become more decentralised,"" Michael Zhong, an analyst with Beijing-based cryptocurrency research firm TokenInsight, was quoted as saying by South China Morning Post. ""If this ban does end up happening its more likely to push BTC prices up than down. The loss of cheap Chinese electricity would raise the mining cost, which is net positive on price. It would also serve to kill the FUD that Bitcoin mining is centralized,"" Mati Greenspan, senior analyst at social trading platform eToro, tweeted. Following the news, Bitcoin is up by 0.29% in the past hour (07:16 UTC) and is down by 0.19% in the past 24 hours. The move by the Commission marks growing government pressure on the cryptocurrency sector. A year ago, articles from influential state-run media outlets signaled that further crackdowns could be launched to force out remaining cryptocurrency trading and mining activities from the country. However, until now, miners have shown a surprising resilience. Moreover, the upcoming rain season in China should once again bring low electricity prices revitalizing the crypto mining industry. Nonetheless, many of those mining companies were looking to relocate to more favorable locations overseas such as Iceland, Canada, and the US, to name a few. Also, there are concerns that China holds more influence over Bitcoin than many are ready to admit. China ""threatens the security, stability, and viability of Bitcoin” with its “political and economic control over domestic [cryptocurrency] activity, and control over its internet infrastructure,” a study, published in October 2018, from Princeton and Florida International Universities claimed. “If the Chinese government assumed control of domestic hash power, this property would grant them an advantage in selecting blocks for the ledger, which is important for some types of attacks,” according to the research. It defined four attack classes: censorship, deanonymization, weakening consensus, disruption to competing mining operations. In total, the academics identified 19 different attacks available to Chinese mining pools. ""In theory it's possible for a government to launch a 51% attack. If a government like the US or China decided they wanted to hurt Bitcoin, they could either rapidly shut down a lot of mining power so that they control a majority of what's left, or they could deploy new hashpower that takes over the network,"" Prof. Matthew Green of John Hopkins University told Cryptonews.com recently. However, he doesn't regard a 51% attack on Bitcoin as especially likely though, due to the enormous expense involved.  ""The thing to keep in mind is that 51% attacks, while they're terrible and undermine confidence, basically just allow double spending,"" says Green. ""This is really bad for merchants and exchanges, and in the long run it could make Bitcoin unusable. But it doesn't allow the attacker to, say, steal everyone's coins. And the cost of a rollback goes up as you go farther back in time.""

Of course, due to the law of supply and demand, transaction fees get more expensive - but there are ways that you can make sure that you don’t overpay them, especially if you’re not in that much of a hurry. Transaction fees are included with your bitcoin transaction in order to have your transactions processed by a miner and confirmed by the Bitcoin network. Simply put, they’re payment to the miner for including your transaction into a block. Since there is only 1 MB of space for transactions within a single block, the more you are willing to pay - and thus outbid other users - the more likely you are to have your transaction picked up by a miner.  Of course, this means that there is a competition among users of the network to make sure their transactions are going through as soon as possible, even if it means overpaying. Bit Consultants, a Bitcoin education and consultancy organization, suggests that users are needlessly overpaying - more than would be strictly necessary to have your transaction included in the next block. However, you could be overpaying for transactions even if you’re not doing it on purpose: wallet developers are often incentivized to make their users pay the highest transaction fees in order to evade customers complaining about their transactions not going through. Fee calculations are horrible. Electrum suggesting 90 sat/byte with an almost empty mempool. So many people paying too much on fees. pic.twitter.com/0GSsyQuzIX Most cryptocurrency wallets have the option of adjusting the fee when sending a transaction, but there is a drawback: you risk having to wait longer for your transaction to be included in a block. “Spenders willing to wait a bit longer can still save money,” Bitcoin Optech, an organization that helps Bitcoin users and businesses integrate scaling technologies, wrote in a recent newsletter, adding, “For example, as of this writing [April 2nd], Bitcoin Core’s fee estimator suggests a fee of 0.00059060 BTC [USD 2.9] per 1,000 vbytes confirmation within 2 blocks but only 0.00002120 [USD 0.1] for confirmation within 50 blocks - saving over 95% for waiting up to an extra 8 hours.” However, the fee estimator still adds that, “Because of the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network and the fact that there is sometimes congestion in the available block space (because of the 1 MB limit), the amounts shown here are probabilistic and there are no guarantees that they will work.” All of these transactions are overpaying fees. Even at these levels next block fee is only 0.00003100 BTC ($0.15).Fees aren't high, the fee estimators are...1. Use wallets with custom fees, RBF, and CPFP2. Manually check mempool before each tx3. Optimize for next block. pic.twitter.com/axbUGbovwO Bit Consultants offers a simple solution: use wallets where you can set a manual fee amount, that support Replace-by-Fee (RBF) and Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) features. Replace-by-Fee is the replacement of an existing, unconfirmed transaction with a new one, identical except for the fee, which is usually higher to boost the chance of it being confirmed soon for when you can’t wait any longer.  Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) is a feature which allows the receiver of a transaction to spend the unconfirmed funds they are expecting. The reason this is helpful is because if you are waiting on a transaction that is stuck because the transaction fees are too low, you can simply send the unconfirmed funds to a different wallet address, with a higher transaction fee. The higher fee will have miners pick up the new transaction and the old as well, and both will be confirmed within the same block.  If you’re more tech savvy, Bit Consultants also recommends checking the mempool by yourself. The size of the mempool is the aggregate size of transactions waiting to be confirmed. If it does not have a very big backlog, there is simply no reason for you to pay more than the minimum - your transaction will get picked up simply because there are not enough other transactions to gain precedence.

The founder of the blog Factor Research and Trading Peter Brandt, who correctly predicted the bear market of 2018, now draws parallels between two previous rallies.  “What’s happened from December of 2017 to 2018 is really an analog to what happened in the 2013 to 2015 bear market, where we saw sequential 10 up-and-down moves in the bear market and we’ve almost identically formed that same sort of pattern,” Brandt told news outlet Yahoo Finance, later adding, “I think the analogs are holding remarkably well and based on those analog studies, I think cryptos now will go back into a parabolic bull market."" Either from Dec '18 low or from retest of same (circa analog dbl bottom in 2015) it would not surprise me if $BTC enters a new parabolic phase. $btcusd pic.twitter.com/XV89Qz7P4n ""The only question I have is do we rally here some and then sometime in late summer check the late 2018 lows or not? There is a chance that it does, there’s a chance that it doesn’t,” Brandt added. Watch the whole interview with Peter Brandt: ___ Meanwhile, founder of the crypto hedge fund Ikigai Travis Kling tweeted about how they sent out a monthly update on April 1st only hours before the pump, where they mull the effect of reflexivity on crypto. “Reflexivity is the theory that a two-way feedback loop exists in which investors’ perceptions affect the market environment, which in turn changes investors perceptions.” Due to bullish news from the beginning of this year, they wrote, “risky whales may be throwing that bucket as we speak,” reversing the downward trend. Also, Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told news outlet Bloomberg, “An instrument that can go back to its 200-day [trading average] and hold it is now back in a bull trend. So I think sentiment has to change, because Bitcoin is now in a bull market.” Moreover, retail investors in China are also becoming more active in the crypto market.  “China is awakening again and buying at 5-10% premiums the past few days,"" Su Zhu, CEO of fund manager Three Arrows Capital, tweeted, also sharing insights by @cnLedger, a Twitter account following cryptocurrency and blockchain in China. It claims that ""We are witnessing a resurgence in Chinese demand for cryptocurrencies. This trend in the making comes after more than a year of relative quiet, a reminder of the time when Chinese volumes were king."" 2/ Why the USDT premium going up? After the PBoC ICO/exchange ban, the most convenient way to buy cryptos in China, is to buy stable coins like USDT first using OTC, and then trade it into any cryptos you want in exchanges. Meanwhile, in South Korea, it seems that the famous Kimchi Premium has been replaced by the ‘Korean Bonus’.

To answer six basic questions often asked by cryptocurrency holders in the US, crypto-focused research and advocacy institution Coin Center published a report with recommendations on what should be done to solve those problems. The IRS has published a guidance in early 2014 that has never been updated and does not answer the questions below. “Rather than targeting ‘unintentional tax cheats,’ we are hopeful that the IRS will adopt our common-sense recommendations,” writes James Foust, senior researcher at Coin Center, in a commentary accompanying the report. According to existing regulations, only “convertible virtual currency” is treated as property, and it is defined as “virtual currency that has an equivalent value in real currency, or that acts as a substitute for real currency” in the guidance, in Notice 2014-21. The guidance only concerns convertible virtual currency.  Although Bitcoin is considered convertible, it is unclear how, by definition, one should categorize other types of digital assets, “such as those having attached voting or payment rights or other contractual rights or obligations, algorithmic stablecoins, airline rewards miles, and video game currencies for which there are official fiat markets - e.g., Second Life’s Linden Dollars - as well as video game currencies that are not meant to be traded for fiat but for which secondary black markets nevertheless exist - e.g., World of Warcraft Gold,” Coin Center points out. Coin Center’s report urges the IRS to first clarify whether the distinction between convertible and non-convertible assets makes a difference for tax purposes, and, in case it does, to clarify whether non-convertibles are taxed and how. Also, clearer guidance on how to separate the two should be issued. If the distinction is non-consequential, then it should be noted that Notice 2014-21, as well as any others, applies to both. To calculate whether a transaction resulted in a gain or a loss to the taxpayer, they must take the fair market value (FMV) in USD realized from the exchange and subtract it from the adjusted basis in the property being sold; the basis is adjusted by various provisions of the tax code.  Now, to the question: how does one calculate the FMV? The guidance states that, “If a virtual currency is listed on an exchange and the exchange rate is established by market supply and demand, the fair market value of the virtual currency is determined by converting the virtual currency into U.S. dollars (or into another real currency which in turn can be converted into U.S. dollars) at the exchange rate, in a reasonable manner that is consistently applied.” However, most cryptocurrencies are listed across several exchanges and their prices on each can differ - which one should they choose? What does the IRS consider “a reasonable manner that is consistently applied”? Because of market volatility and often slow processing time at exchanges, which price should the taxpayer take into account? Coin Center proposes that taxpayers should be left to choose whether they use the exchange rate data from one exchange, averaged data from a set of exchanges, or a third-party exchange rate index, as long as they are consistent in their choice. However, they also note that the “reasonable manner consistently applied” should only be explained, and there would be no need for an additional solution. Buying Bitcoin differs from one day to another, let alone from one month or one quarter of the year to another. This means that the assets are also differently taxed, depending on when they were bought. The intuitive solution would be to keep track of every single transaction and calculate it based on the circumstances of the day they went through. Coin Center calls this task “incredibly onerous but technically feasible” for users that hold their own private keys - but for those using hosted wallets, it may be completely impossible. Stocks and some other securities have other, simpler ways of determining tax lot reliefs, but cryptocurrencies seem to not be eligible to use those. Coin Center recommends that the IRS changes this decision to include cryptocurrencies, letting taxpayers choose tax lot relief methods the same way other commonly traded financial instruments can, and/or adapting those to be applicable in the case of cryptocurrencies. Charity donations in the US are deductible from the taxpayer’s income for that year, and cryptocurrencies are no exception. The deduction is usually capped at USD 500, while donations that warrant a deduction of USD 5,000 or more have to be appraised. There is currently no way to have cryptocurrencies become an exception from appraisal, due to the fact that they are not considered cash. In this case, the recommendation is to have the IRS provide guidance explicitly allowing taxpayers to use exchange data to value cryptocurrency donations - the same way they would calculate the FMV of their transactions - instead of going through a costly appraisal process. Perhaps the most famous example of a hard fork was the creation of Bitcoin Cash in August 2017. Anyone who owned Bitcoin before the fork received an equivalent amount of Bitcoin Cash after it. This is the case with all forks that result in new chains being created. Airdrops are a similar feature: to each holder of a certain token, creators of a new token can choose to give them these new tokens corresponding to the amount of the original tokens they hold. The new tokens are not sold, but simply given away, to people who are known cryptocurrency users and already hold tokens, which are often in some way similar to the ones they are receiving now. In both cases, recipients may be completely unaware of the existence of the new tokens, especially if the fork or airdrop went by unnoticed and without media coverage. Even if they are aware, what if they do not sell or trade the new tokens? What if they never access them, regardless of being aware of them? The report suggests that the new tokens should not be taxed if the owner does not dispose of them. If they do, then the income should be recognized at the moment of disposition, not the moment of receipt or the owner becoming aware of their existence, as these would be too difficult to follow. However, if users hold their tokens at exchanges, anything the exchange decides to do with these new tokens should not affect the taxpayers unless it was done at their own direction. In Notice 2014-21, it is stated that crypto payments are subject to the same reporting requirements as “any other payments made in property.” Current regulations state that every taxpayer holding financial assets exceeding certain thresholds in foreign countries need to report this to a specific institution, according to circumstances. However, Coin Center claims, it is unclear whether holding cryptocurrencies on an exchange that is not located within the United States falls under this guideline or not. It is also not clear whether assets could be treated as foreign financial assets if a counterparty to the transaction is not a US person. As the solution to this problem, it is suggested that the IRS needs to clarify whether cryptocurrencies are subject to these reports or not - there would be no need for changing anything in the current regulations. Meanwhile, this week, Democratic senator Ron Wyden proposed a new version of capital gains tax, where investors would pay taxes on the assets they hold every year when those assets gain value, instead of just when they’re sold. Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania has called it a “breathtakingly terrible idea,” according to a report by CNBC, and people seem to agree wholeheartedly. This new version of the tax could kill a lot of markets, but the cryptocurrency market is especially vulnerable due to high volatility. However, the idea would be incredibly hard to implement - but it would throw yet another wrench into the already confusing idea of cryptocurrency taxes. “This tax proposal [...] adds enormous complexity to a code that is already mind-numbingly incomprehensible,” writes Ron Insana, senior analyst at CNBC. At the beginning of this year, Goldman Sachs-backed cryptocurrency company Circle that is also a member of a lobbying group named Blockchain Association revealed that they’re working with the IRS on clarifying, and even setting up, the rules surrounding crypto-to-crypto payments taxation. “We believe there should be different tax treatment for crypto-to-crypto, especially for smaller payments oriented transactions. The leading government on this issue right now is France, where they are soon passing a law where there will be zero taxes on crypto-to-crypto transactions,” The company’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, said at the time.",113.86999999999989,1

This would imply that developed markets are speculating, while emerging markets use Bitcoin for utility, according to investment firm Passport Capital. Although volume in both markets spiked in December 2017 when Bitcoin reached its all-time high of almost USD 20,000, in subsequent times, they followed vastly different directions. Bitcoin volume in developed markets kept falling until it reached a low not seen since January 2016, and then started climbing again, partially in time with the recent market rally. Meanwhile, volume in emerging markets fell much less and has stayed in the same bounds since the middle of the first half of 2018 - and the more time went by, the more it stabilized. At @PassportCapital we continue to observe a divergence between LocalBitcoins volume in Developed and Emerging Markets. Volume in Developed Markets is tracking price (speculation) while volume in Emerging Markets has stabilized and is growing despite price (utility ) pic.twitter.com/RuOtGCWa0X The data implies that traders from developed markets are speculating on the price and trying to make money off market volatility, while traders in emerging markets are using Bitcoin for utility. Part of the reason might be the fact that developed markets have no need for Bitcoin as a payments system due to a relatively stable fiat currency in place (USD, EUR, JPY, etc.), while emerging markets usually have a more volatile fiat currency, so they tend to try and evade using it, opting for alternative payment methods wherever they can.  One such example - and the most commonly cited one - is Venezuela, where hyperinflation hit 80,000% in 2018, rendering the bolivar close to worthless. Venezuelans have been increasingly turning to the use of cryptocurrencies throughout the country’s socio-economical and political crisis, and the motivations behind this were part of the debate between American economist Nouriel Roubini and smart contract platform Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin at the Deconomy Conference in Seoul on Thursday. Roubini, for example, maintains that the adoption of cryptocurrencies in Venezuela is an exception and shouldn’t be seen as the inception of a hard and fast rule. Buterin disagrees: in his opinion, Venezuela's case was “more to do with cryptocurrencies than fighting inflation. It's about looking for alternative means of protecting one’s assets.”  Venezuelan Bolívar to US Dollar Rates “Nouriel's main point of ‘trust the system’ falls apart the moment you take these ‘exceptional’ events into account. For they aren't as exceptional as mainstream economists claim. We have a war every 50 years. Families migrate every 100. Finance collapses every 10,” reacted Cornell professor Emin Gün Sirer in a tweet.  And while Venezuela’s hyperinflation is certainly currently unparalleled in the world, many countries - the vast majority of them, if not all, belonging to emerging markets - face similar issues due to weak economies, corrupt governments, or even stifling sanctions. In that case, a decentralized, electronic, peer-to-peer payments system is certainly a better option than what they currently have in place, in spite of the former’s volatility - in some cases, this volatility is negligible compared to the alternative, and even with volatility and regulatory uncertainty surrounding digital assets, the choice becomes one for the lesser of two evils. Meanwhile, people in the emerging markets, such as Africa and Asia are actually starting to use cryptocurrencies for transactions, Magdalena Golebiewska, head of Eastern Europe region at Luno, a Bitcoin company boasting two million global accounts, previously told Cryptonews.com. According to her, it is estimated that in 2025 up to 50% of global population will live in the emerging markets. However, the sharp dip that developed market volume experienced on LocalBitcoins does not necessarily have to be completely attributed to speculations - developed markets usually have much better access to centralized cryptocurrency exchanges that remove the dangers of peer-to-peer trading. However, there is no definitive data to separate the two motives.",113.86999999999989,1

Out of these, MXM is up more than 60% and NPXS gained nearly 17%. Overall, bitcoin price seems to be consolidating gains above the USD 4,900 and USD 4,800 support levels. To start a fresh increase, a proper close above the USD 5,000 and USD 5,040 levels is required. On the other hand, a break below the USD 4,800 support might extend correction towards the USD 4,650 level.

Meanwhile, according to Reuters, a major order, worth about USD 100 million, by an anonymous buyer might be a cause that set off a frenzy of computer-driven trading yesterday. “There has been a single order that has been algorithmically-managed across Coinbase, Kraken and Bitstamp, of around 20,000 BTC,” Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, chief executive of cryptocurrency firm BCB Group, was quoted as saying. Marcus Swanepoel, chief executive of London-based bitcoin company Luno, also commented that ""what we’ve likely seen is that one large investor, probably institutional, bought quite a lot of crypto for their portfolio,” Financial Times reported (FT). However, Arca chief investment officer Jeff Dorman, a former trader for Lehman, Merrill and Citadel, told CNBC that even if buying by trading algorithms kicked off the euphoria, that would have reversed quickly if investors were eager to sell.  “Buyers outweighed sellers, and market makers felt the pressure so they took their markets higher, which triggered stop losses and liquidations, which added more buy pressure,” according to Dorman. George Harrap, chief executive officer at Bitspark, told Bloomberg he's putting ""most things on pause"" until the market settles down. While Dave Chapman, CEO of crypto exchange ANXONE, added that ""events such as today's will probably be seen negatively, or viewed as this market doesn't conform to the trading of traditional instruments."" However, Nigel Green, chief executive of consultancy deVere Group, told FT that this dramatic jump is not only likely to attract many investors who have been sitting on the sidelines, but might reignite institutional interest, also. Meanwhile, according to Dorman, the fact that every small dip has been bought immediately in the last few weeks shows that investors are not scared of sell-offs, they are hoping for them so they can buy more.  ""This certainly raises the near-term floor, but this sentiment can change on a dime too,"" he was quoted as saying by CNBC.

Bitcoin gained 21% in early trade and has now slightly corrected back down to $4,712 according to CoinMarketCap. However, no one knows why the Bitcoin jump happened in the first place. Now, some investors wonder if the rally was the result of some sort of April Fool’s joke. Zhao Changpeng, the chief executive officer of Binance, tweeted earlier today that he was “clueless” about what may have triggered Bitcoin’s jump. Packing on over $600 in one night, the last time Bitcoin hit levels like this was in November. The top cryptocurrency plunged more than 70% in 2018 and has been stagnating through most of 2019 thus far. This period has been dubbed the “crypto winter,” and while today’s rally is impressive, analysts believe that “the bounce is not enough to reset crypto winter.” According to Julien Auchecorne, London-based chief operating officer at XBTO International: “we have no major new products and last year’s big breakthroughs are still in their nascent stage.” For Bitcoin’s jump to sustain itself, then bulls should hope for a bigger fundamental reason for the coin to climb. Elsewhere in the blockchain industry, payment giant PayPal has made its first blockchain investment debut. >> Bitcoin Price Jumps 20% on Technical Breakout: More Coins Follow Announced today, PayPal has joined a Series A funding round for Cambridge Blockchain, a startup that helps financial institutions and other companies manage sensitive data using shared ledgers.

The firm has several investors who have backed it over the past nine months. So far, the blockchain startup has raised a total capital of $10.5 million. This is the first investment PayPal has put into a blockchain company. The move may help to encourage greater adoption of blockchain technology and its relevant assets.

""I don’t think today is anything special other than a temporary enthusiasm,” he added. However, Anthony Pompliano, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, a digital asset management firm, stressed that ""short-term volatility doesn’t matter to the long-term investor.""  ""As I have said many times, Bitcoin is a game of accumulation. If an investor has done their own research, understands the risks, believes in the system design, watches the fundamentals, and has a low time preference, they stand a chance to be rewarded handsomely. This doesn’t have to be accomplished over night either,"" he wrote in a newsletter, adding that bitcoin’s recent move has brought back a level of excitement that the market hasn’t seen in over a year. George McDonaugh, CEO of KR1, a listed cryptocurrency and blockchain investment company, reiterated that moving away from a specific catalyst or event, lately there's definitely been positive sentiment in the market these last few weeks. ""There's a sense that perhaps we've reached the lows for this cycle and it's onwards and upwards from here on in. I think it's still too early to call it, but it seems that that hasn't stopped a few eager buyers jumping the starting gun,"" he said in an emailed statement. Meanwhile, advisory firm Fundstrat Global Advisors claims that the worst is behind for crypto and ""sceptics are on the wrong side of history.""  ""We see fewer reasons to question the recent recovery Bitcoin prices—the best quarter since 2017.

The fact that there was USD 415 million worth in short positions on the Bitmex exchange may have been too succulent a target for the market not to move against. There have also been rumours about buying bots going awol after some fake news about an ETF [exchange-traded fund] green light from the SEC [the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] was released as part of an April fools joke. You literally can't make this stuff up. I'd veer towards the first explanation than the second, going by the fact the ETF rumour came out a full 24hrs after the rally began,"" McDonaugh said. Mati Greenspan, senior analyst at social trading platform eToro, suggested in a tweet that ""judging by the timing, it looks like the pump originated in Japan or South Korea."" While his followers are also pointing at China, the Middle East and India. ""The economy is slowing down fast in South Korea and Japan, and the stock market is stagnant, so people are prepared to give crypto a second chance,"" according to our correspondent in South Korea Tim Alper. Also, the fact that South Korean and Japanese giants such as Samsung, Hyundai, Kakao, Rakuten, SBI and many Japanese banks are starting to invest a lot of money into their crypto operations, is creating optimism among buyers and investors, he added.

An initial weekly resistance is at USD 4,150, above which the price may test the USD 4,200 resistance level. If there is a fresh decline below the USD 4,100 level, the price could test the USD 4,050 support. The main weekly support area is near the USD 4,000 level. Ethereum price  also followed a similar structure and it surged towards the USD 145 resistance after it broke the USD 142 resistance. Later, ETH/USD corrected lower and it is consolidating above USD 142.
The main weekly resistance is near the USD 145 level, followed by the USD 150 pivot. On the downside, a break below the USD 140 support may push the price towards the key weekly support at USD 135. Bitcoin cash  remained in a bullish zone above the USD 160 support. BCH/USD recently climbed above the USD 165 resistance and it seems like the price could retest the USD 170 resistance level.

Ripple price  recovered after a dip below the USD 0.300 level. XRP/USD is trading above the USD 0.310 support and it seems to be facing a couple of important resistances near the USD 0.312 and USD 0.314 levels.

In the past three sessions, many small cap altcoins climbed higher and gained more than 8%, including TTC, IOST, ABBC, DASH, NANO, DGTX, BAT, NULS, LOOM and WTC. Out of these, TTC rallied close to 17% and IOST is up around 16%. Overall, bitcoin price is trading in a positive zone above the USD 4,100 and USD 4,060 support levels.

The price is currently consolidating gains and if there is a downside correction, the USD 4,025 and USD 4,000 levels are likely to act as supports. On the upside, a convincing break above the USD 4,060 - USD 4,070 resistance area may perhaps clear the path for more upsides towards USD 4,100 and USD 4,150. Ethereum price  corrected lower and tested the key USD 136 support area. ETH/USD bounced back above the USD 138 resistance and it is currently moving higher.  
The price may perhaps test the USD 140 resistance in the near term. If buyers remain in control and clear the USD 140 resistance, ether buyers could aim the USD 145 and USD 148 resistance levels. Bitcoin cash price  resumed its upward move and traded above the USD 168 resistance. BCH/USD is currently up more than 1% and it seems like the price might accelerate above the USD 170 and USD 172 resistance levels in the near term.

EOS  corrected a few points after a strong rally towards the USD 4.35 level. The price is currently trading near the USD 4.20 level, with the next key support near the USD 4.15 level. On the upside, there are hurdles near USD 4.30 and USD 4.35.
Ripple price  found support near the USD 0.305 level and later started a fresh upward move. XRP/USD traded above the USD 0.306 and USD 0.307 levels, with a bullish bias.

In the past two sessions, a few small cap altcoins climbed higher between 5%-12%, including KCS, BAT, AOA, XTZ, MXM, IOST, XEM and ELA. Out of these, KCS is up more than 12% and BAT is up close to 11%. Overall, bitcoin price is trading in a bullish zone above the USD 4,000 support level.

Yan Liberman, Co-Founder and Principal at Delphi Digital, confirmed to Cryptonews.com that this still remains the case at the end of March.  The paper sees strong hands in long term holders*, which have not sold in the past three months and are not expected to start doing so in the coming period. “Over that same time period [end of November to the end of January], we’ve noticed a decrease in 3-5 year holders from 9% to 8%, where it’s held flat. Aside from this slight decline, there hasn’t been much selling from long-term holders as BTC price remained in a consolidation period for much of the last three months,” the report said adding that the proportion of 2-3 year holders remains flat and low, implying theses individuals have mostly sold or are likely to continue to hold. The researchers estimate that even under conservative assumptions for lost coins, there isn't much potential selling that can come from long-term holders.  However, what could prompt 1-3 year holders to sell their coins in the coming months? According to Liberman, assuming Bitcoin doesn't get successfully attacked, it's likely that those individuals don't sell in the coming months unless: He goes on to explain that the first and second option are highly unlikely, while the third is difficult to predict, “because everyone has different breakeven prices.” “The 1-2 year holder group implies that you purchased between March 27th, 2017 and March 27, 2018. We actually have more granular data, and the mix of 12-18 month holders is larger than the 18-24 months. This implies that more of the 1-2 year holders purchased at a higher price point, thus their break-even is higher, and they're less likely to sell for a small price increase,” the Co-founder said.  Meanwhile, 2-3 year holders make up a very small amount of overall bitcoin ownership.  “They've all purchased this BTC at a significant discount to current prices, so if they haven't sold already, it's difficult to see what triggers them to sell in the next coming months,” Liberman concluded. The company estimates to extract more information from the 2-3 year holder band in June as the 1-2 year owners begin to shift over to become 2-3 year holders. $BTC UTXO age distribution animatedDec 2017 - March 2019data @unchainedcap pic.twitter.com/FQ2aeTV7gY Another thing that has the community worried about how the prices will behave is the halvening, set to happen in 2020, when the Bitcoin block mining reward will decrease from 12.5 to 6.25 bitcoins. As Cryptonews.com previously reported, the research team believes that this will be the last reward halving to have a very significant impact on price.  “The upcoming halvening in May 2020 also functions as an intermediate catalyst for a reduction in selling pressure. For reference, prices bottomed 542 days before the halvening in 2016. As of March 15th, we’re ~435 days away from the next expected halvening,” they added earlier this month. Also, in its mid-March report, Delphi Digital said that institutional capital wading into this market will eventually suppress crypto asset volatility, boosting bitcoin’s appeal as investors flock to safety, but they see this as a longer-term trend unlikely to materialize in the foreseeable future. They’re also discussing Bitcoin’s shifting narrative from a peer-to-peer currency to digital gold. Meanwhile, adoption of the Lightning Network will help enable those who prefer to use the digital currency as a peer to peer currency, Liberman said adding that he doesn’t believe that it'll change the general narrative. “It’s functional for different people in different ways. Those that can afford to treat it as a long term SoV [Store of Value] type of investment (developing nations) are doing that. At the same time, those individuals that don’t have the ability to save are also able to use it as a potential way to mitigate foreign currency risk (temporarily), a payments processor in areas that are unbanked or censored by the nation state, and as a method of transferring wealth when attempting to relocate,” the Co-founder said.
_______ * - Delphi Digital analyses UTXO (unspent transaction output) trends. UTXO stands for the unspent output from bitcoin transactions. Every transaction creates a new UTXO, and the age of the UTXO indicates the block that it was first included in. In other words, the UTXO age indicates the last time bitcoin was moved. Analyzing Bitcoin's aggregate UTXO age distribution over time provides insight into the buying and selling patterns of previous market cycles. This allows the company to forecast where we are in relation to prior cycles and what we can likely expect going forward.",-18.4699999999998,0

BTC/USD recently tested the USD 4,050 resistance and corrected lower. The price is currently (UTC 08:10 AM) consolidating in a range and dips remain supported near the USD 4,000 and USD 3,980. Similarly, ethereum price extended gains and tested the key USD 140 resistance. Later, ETH/USD corrected lower and it is currently trading near the USD 138 support. Ripple price traded close to the USD 0.310 resistance, where sellers emerged and later the price corrected lower below USD 0.308 and USD 0.306. Total market capitalization  There was an upside extension in bitcoin price  above the USD 4,000 resistance. BTC/USD traded above the USD 4,020 level and tested the USD 4,050 resistance level. However, buyers failed to gain strength above USD 4,040 and the price later corrected lower. 
An immediate support is at USD 4,000, below which the price may perhaps test the USD 3,980 support. The main buy area is near the USD 3,950 level. On the upside, a strong follow through above USD 4,040 and USD 4,050 is must for buyers to gain traction. Ethereum price  tested the all-important USD 140 resistance level before sellers emerged. ETH/USD corrected lower and recently tested the USD 138 support level. At the outset, it seems like the price is struggling to stay above USD 138 and it could correct towards USD 136.
On the upside, the USD 139 and USD 140 levels are important resistances. A successful close above USD 140 may push the price towards the USD 144 level. Bitcoin cash price  extended its rally above the USD 168 and USD 170 levels. BCH/USD traded close to the USD 174 level and recently corrected below the USD 170 support. The next key support is near the USD 165 level, where buyers might appear.
EOS  surged above the USD 4.00 and USD 4.20 resistance levels. The price even broke the USD 4.30 resistance and traded close to USD 4.35. It is currently correcting lower towards the USD 4.20 and USD 4.15 support levels.
Ripple price  climbed higher towards the USD 0.309 and USD 0.310 resistance levels, where buyers struggled. As a result, there was a downside correction and the price declined below the USD 0.306 support. It is currently testing USD 0.305 and the next support is at USD 0.304. Despite corrective moves in bitcoin and ethereum, a few small cap altcoins gained more than 8%, including MANA, RVN, XTZ, FCT, NULS, AION and BAT. Out of these, MANA climbed more than 36% and RVN is up close to 28%. The current price action suggests a downside correction in bitcoin price below the USD 4,000 support level. However, declines are likely to find a strong buying interest and BTC/USD might bounce back from the USD 3,980 or USD 3,950 support in the coming sessions.

Finally, there was a strong bullish reaction and the price climbed above the USD 3,950 and USD 3,980 resistance levels.
The price is now trading near the USD 4,000 resistance. If there is follow through above USD 4,000 and 4,015, the price is likely to accelerate towards the USD 4,070 swing high. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,980, but the main support is near the USD 3,950 level. Ethereum price  tested the USD 130 support area, where a strong buying interest emerged. As a result, ETH started a solid upward move and traded above the USD 132 and USD 135 resistance levels.
The price even broke the USD 137 level and it is currently consolidating below the USD 138 resistance. The next key resistance is near the USD 140 level. On the downside, the USD 135 level may once again act as a support. Bitcoin cash price  jumped by more than 5% and broke the USD 160 and USD 164 resistance levels. BCH/USD is currently trading near the USD 166 level and it may continue to rise towards the USD 170 resistance.
EOS  performed really well and climbed above the USD 3.85 resistance level. The price is up more than 10% and it recently cleared the USD 4.00 resistance. A high was formed near USD 4.10 level and the price is currently consolidating gains.
Ripple price  tested the USD 0.295 support level before starting a fresh rebound. XRP/USD traded above the USD 0.300 and USD 0.305 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. The next major hurdle for buyers is near the USD 0.308 level. In the past three sessions, many small cap altcoins recovered and jumped more than 10%, including ENG, WICC, WTC, ADA, WAN, PIVX and XZC. Out of these, ENG climbed more than 50% and WICC is up close to 13%. Overall, bitcoin price jumped back in a positive zone, with a close above the USD 3,950 and USD 3,970. However, the USD 4,000 resistance is still intact. Therefore, a clear break above the USD 4,000 level is must for BTC buyers to retain action and push the price further higher.

Ethereum price  also faced an increase in selling pressure after it failed to surpass the USD 138 resistance. ETH/USD declined below the USD 135 support level and tested the next key support at USD 132.

This is far from the first prediction he has made: from reminding people during the bull market in December 2017 that Bitcoin is still extremely volatile, over calling a USD 50,000 forecast in case of a positive regulatory ETF during 2018, to calling a bottom at USD 2,000. Now, his latest prediction is again bullish.  “Green shoots will begin to appear in early Q4. Free money and collective amnesia are powerful drugs. Also after two years of wage cucking, punters should have a few sheckles [sic] to rub together,” said the CEO in a newsletter last Friday, adding, “The 2019 chop will be intense, but the markets will claw back to USD 10,000. That is a very significant psychological barrier. It’s a nice round sexy number."" According to Hayes, USD 20,000 is the ultimate recovery.  ""However, it took 11 months from USD 1,000 to USD 10,000, but less than one month from USD 10,000 to USD 20,000 back to USD 10,000. Melissa Lee [a reporter and news anchor for CNBC] peep this. USD 10,000 is my number, and I’m stickin’ to it,” he said. Following the prediction by Hayes, a Twitter poll showed that 59% of around 1,000 respondents see Bitcoin reaching USD 10,000 by the end of the year. Lets first get to $6000 range and see what happens 😋 Meanwhile, back when the cryptoverse was booming and Bitcoin was reaching its heights in December 2017, Hayes warned in an interview with Forbes: “People have been lulled into complacency with a market that keeps going up every day. They don’t understand that this is an extremely volatile asset. It’s not constrained by national borders and there are people out to do whatever they can to make money, including nefarious things against exchanges.”  Sure enough, the price dropped in the coming days and never recovered to those heights again.  His next famous prediction came in June 2018 in an interview with news outlet CNBC, when he said that a positive regulatory response to Bitcoin could send it soaring to USD 50,000 by the end of that year. Unfortunately, the positive response did not happen, and so neither did his prediction come to pass.  However, his idea of a bottom looks more accurate: “I think that something that goes up to USD 20,000 in one year can have a correction down to USD 6,000 and will definitely find a bottom at about USD 3,000 and USD 5,000 range.”  When it was obvious that there was no time for a regulatory response to send Bitcoin up before the end of 2018, Hayes suggested that Bitcoin could bottom out at USD 2,000 before reversing course back in November 2018.

If Dorsey’s tweets are anything to go by, then the company is hiring engineers and a designer to “work full-time on open source contributions to the bitcoin/crypto ecosystem.”  The Square cash app already supports Bitcoin purchases and sales so it is intriguing to think of what these new hires may be working on.  But beyond that tweet, information is scarce. However, what is notable, is that these new hires will be able to be paid in Bitcoin if they so choose.

This is a small way to give back, and one that’s aligned with our broader interests: a more accessible global financial system for the internet.” Dorsey recently spoke in a podcast about the Square app saying how payment apps like it are the future for cryptocurrency: “We’re empowering the electrician to send invoices, setting up the food truck with a delivery option, helping the clothing boutique pay its employees, and giving the coffee chain capital for a second, third, and fourth location.” What do you think?

EOS  is moving lower and it is currently trading below USD 3.70. An immediate support is at USD 3.65, below which the price could decline towards the USD 3.62 support. On the upside, the key resistances are USD 3.75 and USD 3.80.
Ripple price  failed to stay in the positive zone and declined below the USD 0.314 support. XRP/USD is currently holding the USD 0.312 support, but there is a risk of more losses towards the USD 0.311 or USD 0.310 support zone. Despite bearish moves in ethereum and ripple, a few small cap altcoins gained traction, including KIN, RVN, MXM, KCS, KNC, ENJ, XLM and WAN. Out of these, KIN rallied more than 35% and RVN is up close to 15%. Overall, bitcoin is trading in a tight range and it seems to be preparing for the next break either above USD 4,000 or below USD 3,950. If there is a downside correction, BTC buyers are likely to protect the key USD 3,900 support, which was a solid resistance this past week.

Moreover, Bitcoin Sentscore seems to be back to the range it had before mid-November crash, according to Pierre-Alexandre Picard, co-founder and CMO of Predicoin.  Bitcoin SentScore since August 2019: Meanwhile, the average market sentiment score among the top ten today is 5.65, again higher than last week (5.43) and marking yet another improvement on a week-by-week basis. For Bitcoin, it's fourth Monday in a row with the highest score (6.7) out of the top 10. Bitcoin Cash (5.7) and Stellar (5.5) made it onto the winning list this time, joining the same winners as last week: Bitcoin (6.7), Litecoin and EOS (6.2 both), Ethereum (6.1), and Binance Coin (5.9).  Sentiment change among the top 10 coins*:
Interpreting the SentScore’s scale:
- 0 to 2,5: very negative
- 2 to 4,5: somewhat negative zone
- 4,5 to 5,5: Neutral zone
- 5,5 to 7,5: somewhat positive zone
- 7,5 to 10: very positive This is Stellar’s first time on the winning list since we started these weekly updates in February 2019, and only its second time above the negative range. Part of the buzz, which shows the intensity of social interest for a coin, around Stellar comes from the fact that the congregation of payments, FinTech and financial services industry called the Money 20/20 conference in Asia is due to start tomorrow, March 19th, and will feature Stellar’s co-founder Jed McCaleb as one of the speakers, Picard suggested. Also, it is expected that Stellar will make a joint announcement with information technology giant IBM, as Jesse Lund, IBM’s Head of Blockchain and Digital Currencies, will join McCaleb on stage. (Updated: On Monday, IBM announced a payments network based on blockchain and the Stellar protocol.) Meanwhile, despite an increase, XRP  still has the lowest score of 4.5, which marks the line between the negative and neutral zones. The last time this coin has entered neutral territory was February 25th, when it managed to get a score of 4.7. The neutral list holds Tether (4.6) and TRON (5.1), where the former dropped compared to last week, while the latter rose. Tether’s drop can, at least partially, be attributed to the news that its USD 2 billion token supply is now backed by not only real US dollars, but other assets, also, according to Picard.  Bitcoin Cash and XRP are both winners in the weekly change category with 8.7% improvement compared to last week. Bitcoin Cash found its strength in news, which got a score of 7.8, while its weakest spot are fundamentals with 3.1. XRP’s score explains its total score and why it’s so low: news are again on their side with 6.4, but the technical side only scored 2.3. The biggest loser is Binance Coin with a drop of 1.8%, followed by Ethereum with -1.6% and Bitcoin with -1.5%. However, all of them still remain on the winning list. Binance Coin’s strength is technical, with 7.5, while its weakness is fundamental - 3.7. Ethereum’s strength is also news with 6.4, but weakness is also technical with 3.5. Bitcoin’s fundamentals are soaring at 8.6, while the social aspect - at 4.5 - leaves something to be desired.

BTC/USD tested the USD 4,050 level and later corrected lower. It is currently (UTC 08:00 AM) trading below USD 4,000, with many supports on the downside above USD 3,900. Similarly, there were bullish moves in ethereum price above USD 135 and USD 140. ETH tested the USD 145 resistance and recently corrected below USD 140. Ripple price spiked above the USD 0.320 resistance on two occasions, but it failed to hold gains and later corrected towards the USD 0.312 support. Total market capitalization  Finally, there was a strong bullish wave in bitcoin price  above the USD 3,900 resistance. BTC/USD even broke the USD 4,000 weekly resistance area before sellers emerged near the USD 4,050 level. A high was formed just below USD 4,060 before the price started a downside correction.
The price is currently trading below the USD 4,000 level, with an immediate support at USD 3,950 and 3,940. However, the main weekly support is at USD 3,900, which was a key resistance earlier. On the upside, the key resistances are near USD 4,000 and USD 4,050. Ethereum price  also followed a similar pattern and climbed above the USD 135 and USD 140 resistance levels. ETH/USD tested the USD 145 resistance and later corrected below the USD 140 level.
The main weekly supports are at USD 135 and USD 132, below which there is a risk of more losses below the USD 130 support in the near term. On the upside, the USD 140 level is an initial resistance, followed by the USD 145 pivot level. Bitcoin cash  performed well recently as it rallied above the USD 140 and USD 148 resistance levels. BCH/USD even surged above USD 160 before sellers appeared near USD 165. It is currently correcting lower, with supports near USD 155 and USD 150.
EOS  made another attempt to clear the USD 3.80 resistance, but buyers failed to gain momentum. The price is currently correcting below USD 3.75 and it may continue to decline towards the USD 3.65 or USD 3.62 support area.
Ripple price  spiked on a couple of occasions towards the USD 0.320 resistance, but it failed to stay above USD 0.320 and USD 0.318. XRP/USD corrected lower recently and tested the USD 0.314 support. The next main supports are USD 0.312 and USD 0.310. Despite dips in bitcoin and ETH, a few small cap altcoins traded higher and gained more than 8%, including WAX, GXC, KCS, CRO, R and BCH. Out of these, WAX rallied more than 11% and GXC is up around 10%. Overall, the recent upward move in bitcoin was encouraging, but the current correction wave must find support near USD 3,950 or USD 3,920. On the upside, a fresh daily close above USD 4,000 could trigger renewed buying interest in BTC in the coming sessions.

And the dollar isn't surging like it was last year. That's a headwind that's gone away.” The interest that both traditional financial institutions and other entities such as social networks are showing for crypto assets is also going to boost the price forward, he believes.  “We've seen the launch of digital currencies by not only JPMorgan and Mizuho Bank, but also Facebook and some social media companies gearing up. And, of course, in places like Venezuela, where bitcoin's become very large and widely used, turmoil is causing adoption growth. So I think these are really setting up for a strong ... year,” he said. But how can you tell where the price is headed? The secret lies in watching 200-day moving averages, Lee believes. The moving average is the calculation of the closing prices of an asset over a period of time, and if Bitcoin keeps at its current trading price of below USD 4,000, “it'll cross above its 200-day by August,” he believes. The real damage was dealt during the Bitcoin Cash fork wars, when the whole market collapsed, mid-November 2018. “I think it really undermined investor confidence in sort of the dynamics around the market, so I think that bitcoin's going to spend a lot of time below USD 6,000 sort of fixing itself,” he explained, adding that ""the outside window is five or six months before bitcoin starts to look technically like it’s back in a bull market.” According to 2019 Outlook report for the cryptocurrency market, published by Fundstrat in February, the firm admits that 2018 was a disappointing year for crypto, while also adding that they expect the market to stage “a visible recovery” in 2019.  Meanwhile, popular cryptocurrency analyst Murad Mahmudov and Arjun Balaji, an independent blockchain researcher, reportedly see the Bitcoin bottom in the USD 2,000 - USD 2,500 range by the end of summer 2019, while another crypto analyst and trader Tone Vays is the one to go as low as USD 1,300. Tom Lee started out by saying that Bitcoin could climb back to USD 20,000 by mid-2018 and even reach USD 25,000 by the end of December of that year. He later amended this end-of-the-year forecast, pulling it down to a USD 20,000 - USD 22,000 range. Then in November, when Bitcoin was trading at around USD 5,500, Lee was certain the price would triple in the remaining month and a half. When all his forecasts failed, he maintained that the market was wrong and that Bitcoin’s true value lied between USD 13,800 and USD 14,800 in December 2018. In January 2019, he confirmed that USD 25,000 per Bitcoin forecast is a good value for the cryptocurrency, but that the timing “may be difficult.”

BTC even fell sharply below USD 3,850, but downsides were limited. The price is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) trading with a positive bias above the USD 3,880 level and it seems like buyers are eyeing an upside break above USD 3,900 and USD 3,950. Ethereum price retested the USD 130 support and bounced back above USD 132. ETH/USD is moving higher and it may clear the USD 135 resistance in the near term. Ripple price is currently consolidating above USD 0.311 and it might rise towards the USD 0.314 and 0.315 resistance levels.  Total market capitalization  After a sharp dip below the USD 3,850 support, bitcoin price  bounced back. BTC/USD is trading above the USD 3,850 support, with a positive angle. The current technical structure is positive and it seems like there are high chances of an upside break above the USD 3,900 and USD 3,920 resistance levels.
The next key resistances are at USD 3,950 and USD 4,000. If there is a downside correction below the USD 3,850 support, the price could revisit the USD 3,800 support level. Ethereum price  also followed a similar pattern and declined sharply below the USD 131 and 130 levels. Later, ETH/USD recovered and settled above USD 132.
The price is trading higher, with signs of an upside break above the USD 134 and USD 135 resistance levels. If buyers fail again, the price will likely revisit the USD 130 support area in the coming sessions. Bitcoin cash price  increased steadily above the USD 130 and USD 131 resistance levels. BCH/USD is currently trading above USD 132 and it could rise towards the USD 134 and USD 135 resistance levels. On the downside, the USD 130 level is the key support.
EOS  is again attempting to clear the USD 3.60 resistance level. If it succeeds, the next stop for buyers could be USD 3.70 or USD 3.75. On the downside, the main supports are near USD 3.55 and USD 3.50. 
Ripple price  is trading flat above the USD 0.310 and 0.311 levels and facing a lot of hurdles near the USD 0.312, USD 0.314 and USD 0.315 levels. If there is a downside break below the USD 0.310 support, XRP could decline towards the USD 0.305 support. In the past two sessions, many small cap altcoins extended gains and moved up by more than 8%, including CRO, LSK, DGTX, QTUM, MCO, WAN, XVG, XEM, DCR and PPT. Out of these, CRO rallied more than 50% and LSK is up close to 20%. The overall technical formation is suggesting gains in bitcoin as long as there is no daily close below USD 3,800. On the upside, BTC must gain strength above the USD 3,900, USD 3,950 and USD 4,000 resistance levels to continue higher.

Gox, Mark Karpeles, will likely avoid having to serve prison time in Japan after receiving a suspended sentence. Karpeles was on Friday found guilty by the Tokyo District Court for tampering with the exchange’s financial records, as well as mixing his personal finances with those of the exchange, according to multiple media reports. However, the court dismissed the embezzlement charges that had also been raised against Karpeles, saying he “acted without ill intent.” Karpeles originally faced a prison term of up to 10 years in Japan for the embezzlement charges. “The charge of electronic record tampering is true and deserves punishment, but there’s no criminal evidence of embezzlement,” the court said, Bloomberg reported. It further blamed the 33-year-old Frenchman for “massive harm to the trust of his users.”  “There is no excuse for the defendant, who is an engineer with expert knowledge, to abuse his status and authority to perform clever criminal acts,” the court said, before giving him a 2 1/2 year “suspended sentence,” which does not need to be served unless another crime is committed within four years. Karpeles, who has maintained his innocence throughout the trial, was also ordered to pay for part of the cost of the trial. Finished reading Karpeles verdict. In summary, the court found that the way he ran Mt. Gox was a total mess and that he tampered w/ records to hide the fact it was missing a lot of Bitcoin, but he did not do it for personal gain or have ill intent. Attaching relevant parts. pic.twitter.com/3n7oEwSsK0 “I am happy to be judged not guilty for embezzlement and breach of trust. I will discuss with my lawyers and decide how to proceed on the remaining charge,” Karpeles told CNN in a brief comment. Mark Karpeles bought Mt. Gox, which was originally a marketplace for illustrated cards, in 2011 and turned it into the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. In 2014, the exchange collapsed in a spectacular fashion after 850,000 bitcoins were stolen, leading to a loss of nearly USD 500 million for users of the exchange. To this day, the majority of the missing bitcoins have yet to be recovered. More than four years after the infamous Mt. Gox incident victims have been filing rehabilitation claims and are now waiting to be reimbursed. However, it seems that they might need to wait even longer, as two different entities are slowing down the process: cryptocurrency company CoinLab, headed by CEO Peter Vessenes, and former child actor and crypto entrepreneur Brock Pierce, as previously reported. _____

The exchange operator also says it is currently considering its future stance on cryptocurrency derivatives trading. According to an official release, the CFE operator stated, “The CFE is assessing its approach with respect to how it plans to continue to offer digital asset derivatives for trading. While it considers its next steps, the CFE does not currently intend to list additional XBT futures contracts for trading.” The exchange noted, however, that “currently listed XBT futures contracts remain available for trading” – meaning existing futures listed last month (XBTM19) will continue to run until June.

Estonia-based digital asset marketplace DX.Exchange announced at the conference that it will begin to list security tokens starting today, March 14th, along with launching their own token, dubbed In Good We Trust (IGWT). The token’s purpose is to showcase the new security token service and help raise funds for the company, which will be restructured into a new entity called DXtech Exchange. They have also announced that 18 million IGWT tokens will be sold in a private sale, with 10% of the exchange’s profits to be regularly distributed to the token holders. There will be no minimum investment amount. DX.Exchange’s CEO and co-founder Daniel Skowronski said at his panel, titled “STOs and Security Tokens - The Future of Crypto is Closer than we Think” that the move would “mark a further step towards realizing its vision of tokenizing the world and opening the doors to a new crypto economy.” He went on to add, “We believe that all assets whether its securities, art or real-estate will be tokenized. This tokenization has many benefits but the strongest is the ability to help create wealth for people all over the world no matter their social economic situation. At DX, we can help trade the untradeable.” A panel, titled “Crypto Analysts: When Moon?” called out new bottoms - reportedly as low as USD 1,300 for Bitcoin.  According to tweets from the event, popular cryptocurrency analyst Murad Mahmudov and Arjun Balaji, an independent blockchain researcher, see the Bitcoin bottom in the USD 2,000 - USD 2,500 range by the end of summer 2019, while another crypto analyst and trader Tone Vays is the one to go as low as USD 1,300. However, at least Mahmudov and Balaji are reportedly more optimistic about 2020.

Users are now able to deposit, invest, and withdraw ether directly from the Abra app. Interestingly, ETH was previously available on Abra as a synthetic asset, meaning that users had exposure to the price movements of ether and could only make deposits into the Abra app via a US-based bank account, American Express card, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin. Now, users can directly deposit and withdraw ETH via any Ethereum wallet. “By adding native ether support, Abra users will now be able to easily buy and move ether from other wallets to the Abra app,” said Bill Barhydt, CEO and founder of Abra. “This also opens up the potential to use ETH as an on-ramp to invest in the other assets listed on Abra.” The avocado issue started on Twitter, between Tron CEO Justin Sun and Buterin. After Tron acquired BitTorrent,  a file sharing protocol with the community of over 100 million users, and launched the BitTorrent token, Sun dug out an interview from 2017 where Buterin praises BitTorrent. The latter was quick to correct the assumption that he is indirectly endorsing Tron: “That interview was from Aug 2017. Tron acquired BitTorrent in July 2018. My praise for BitTorrent had nothing to do with Tron. This is like implying that because I like avocados, I approve of everyone who has ever bought an avocado.” Now, the Tron community got stuck on the avocado comment.

ETH declined below USD 132 and it could test the USD 130 support.

Once there is an upside break above USD 3,900, buyers are likely to take control. The next key resistance is near the USD 3,980 - USD 4,000 zone, where sellers might put up a strong fight. Ethereum price  started following a slow and steady bearish path after it failed to break the USD 135 resistance. ETH is approaching (UTC 08:10 AM) the USD 130 support, which could play an important role in the near term.

EOS  is currently consolidating above the USD 3.50 support level. To start a fresh upward move, the price must clear the USD 3.60 and USD 3.70 resistance levels. On the downside, the USD 3.50 support is very important, below which there could be heavy losses.
Ripple price  rallied recently above the USD 0.315 and USD 0.320 resistance levels. However, XRP/USD fails to hold gains and declined sharply to revisit the USD 0.310 support level. The price may consolidate for a few hours before a fresh upward move. Despite range moves in bitcoin, a few small cap altcoins gained traction and moved up by more than 7%, including ETN, WAX, REPO, ETN, BCD, INB, PIVX, XLM and KCS. Out of these, ETN rallied more than 20% and WAX is up close to 18%. Overall, bitcoin price is trading near a crucial inflection point and is likely preparing for the next key break. BTC could either clear the USD 3,900 hurdle and rally strongly or decline sharply below the USD 3,800 support level.

This comes after they said they could always create money, and the crypto community was quick to reply with accusations of scamming. The bank had started a Twitter thread under the hashtag #AskECB, and Twitter user @Gianluca844 took the chance to ask, “Where did you get the money for the [quantitative easing]?” The bank replied:  Praet: As a central bank, we can create money to buy assets #AskECB https://t.co/zTQuU4y1ch The quote was attributed to Peter Praet, executive board member and chief economist of the ECB.  Quantitative easing (QE), also known as large-scale asset purchases, is an expansionary monetary policy whereby a central bank, which is the ECB in this case, buys predetermined amounts of government bonds or other financial assets in order to stimulate the economy and increase liquidity.  This operation started in 2015 and was finished by the end of 2018, during which the ECB has spent EUR 2.6 trillion (USD 3 trillion), buying up mostly government but also corporate debt, asset-backed securities and covered bonds, at a pace of EUR 1.3 million a minute, according to Reuters. That equates to roughly 7,600 euros (BTC 2.23) for every person in the currency bloc. The cryptocurrency community took issue with the reply, with many tweeting gifs of the Bitconnect Ponzi scheme, which has since its downfall become synonymous with shady doings. “Central banks are marketing bitcoin better than we can,” replied Twitter user @zackvoell, while user @wiz has more to say: “The world is now opening their eyes to your scam of robbing people of their purchasing power by endlessly printing bank notes on worthless paper. The global economy will implement a new Bitcoin standard to opt-out of your scam and prevent further theft by central banks.” ""As a reminder, when central banks and governments decide to simply print more money, they are stealing wealth from majority of the population and enriching the elites. According to the [International Monetary Fund], inflation is one of the leading causes of income inequality in the world,"" Anthony Pompliano, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, a digital asset management firm, wrote in his newsletter.  He went further to explain that ""inflation leads to rising prices for real assets (real estate, etc), which are owned by the elites generally."" ""Central banks may be able to print more fiat dollars, but eventually the Ponzi scheme will end. When it does, Bitcoin will be there, as scarce as ever, with the inability for anyone to print more,"" the famous Bitcoin bull concluded.  An interesting point was raised by user @spiroseliot, who tweeted a picture of a street, supposedly in Venezuela, filled with paper money that was rendered worthless due to the country’s recent hyperinflation. the real value of paper-fiat money... pic.twitter.com/hLyWWJDfBg One of the main points that Bitcoin proponents raise as an advantage over central bank policies is the fact that Bitcoin is capped at 21 million units, which means that in times of shortage, it cannot be printed, which prevents inflation. However, due to the laws of supply and demand, the price of individual bitcoins would rise. Additionally, due to its decentralized and mathematically specified nature, the asset cannot be controlled by any given entity.  On the other hand, the QE was launched as a way to prevent sub-zero inflation from further hitting an economy still reeling from the euro zone debt crisis in March 2015. While it did lift economic growth, helping the rise of wages and lending while keeping inflation subdued, the ECB has also been criticized because the bond buying has depressed interest rates and hurt European banks’ profitability. Meanwhile, the Basel Committee, the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks, stressed that ""crypto-assets"" [that] are at times referred to as ""crypto-currencies"", do not reliably provide the standard functions of money and are unsafe to rely on as a medium of exchange or store of value.  ""Crypto-assets are not legal tender, and are not backed by any government or public authority,"" the Committee said in an announcement today.  ""They present a number of risks for banks, including liquidity risk; credit risk; market risk; operational risk (including fraud and cyber risks); money laundering and terrorist financing risk; and legal and reputation risks,"" it added.

BTC even climbed above USD 3,880, but it struggled to gain momentum above the USD 3,900 resistance level. It is currently consolidating below USD 3,900 and it seems like buyers are sighting an upside break in the near term. Ethereum remained well below the USD 135 resistance and it is currently (UTC 08:00 AM) testing the key USD 132 support. Ripple price climbed higher and settled above USD 0.310, with a positive angle. Total market capitalization  There were mostly range moves in bitcoin price  above the USD 3,830 and USD 3,850 support levels in the past two sessions. BTC made an attempt to climb above USD 3,900, but it failed. Having said that, the price action suggests that there are high chances of more gains above USD 3,900 and USD 3,920 in the short term.
On the other hand, if there is a downside reaction, the USD 3,850 level may act as a support. Any further declines could take the price towards the key USD 3,800 support level. Ethereum price  struggled to break the USD 135 resistance and declined recently towards the USD 132 support. If there are more losses, ETH could revisit the key USD 130 support level in the next few hours.
On the upside, the USD 134 and USD 135 levels are important hurdles. Should there be an upside break above USD 135, the price will most likely climb above the USD 140 resistance level. Bitcoin cash price  settled below the USD 130 support and it is currently consolidating near the USD 128 level. If BCH/USD needs to climb higher, it must break the USD 130 and USD 132 resistance levels. If not, it may revisit the USD 125 support.
EOS  struggled to clear the USD 3.70 resistance and corrected lower. However, the USD 3.60 level is acting as a support and it seems like the price may trade higher towards the USD 3.70 and USD 3.75 levels.
Ripple price  is slowly moving higher and it is currently placed above the USD 0.310 support. XRP/USD must break the USD 0.312 resistance level to stage a rebound towards the USD 0.314 and USD 0.315 resistance levels. On the downside, the USD 0.310 and USD 0.305 levels are decent supports. In the past few hours, many small cap altcoins rallied more than 10%, including CRO, XZC, MXM, KMD, BCD, VET, ENJ, KCS, AION, ETN, DGB, BCN, DASH and QASH. Out of these, CRO rallied more than 40% and XZC is up close to 34%. Overall, bitcoin price is trading with a positive angle above the USD 3,850 level. However, BTC buyers need to gain traction above USD 3,900 and USD 3,920 to set the stage for a solid upward move towards USD 4,000 and USD 4,040 in the coming sessions.

Now, sending data through space using a satellite and paying for it with bitcoins is easier than ever - but what possibilities does this offer, exactly? Blockstream aims to solve blockchain’s dependence on the internet by replacing it with satellites. Initially launched in August 2017, the satellite was first available to users from Africa, Europe and the Americas, with the goal to let users access Bitcoin without the need for an internet connection. In December 2018, the company announced their coverage of the Asia-Pacific region, as well as adding support for Lightning Network payments.  According to the company, the Blockstream Satellite network broadcasts the Bitcoin blockchain around the world 24/7, protecting against network interruptions and providing anyone in the world with the opportunity to use Bitcoin.  Moreover, the satellite message API lets users send encrypted messages to each other from some of the remotest regions on Earth and pay for those message in bitcoin using the Lightning Network service. Back in December, the company’s chief strategy officer, Samson Mow, told Forbes, “Bitcoin has always been about uncensorable money, and now we have uncensorable communications as well.” Now, for those wondering, “What am I supposed to do with this?” we simply say, “Human ingenuity knows no bounds.” You may decide to use this service to send messages and pay for it with bitcoins, but where’s the fun in that? For example, online publication Vice Motherboard has already used the service to send the Communist Manifesto up to space and back to Earth again, where anyone with the right software and dish setup could receive it. “I sent the passage—the part that says, ‘The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains’—to space, and then back down to Earth, using Bitcoin. My reasoning for doing this was… Well, why the hell not? We live in a world where this is possible, my friends,” writes author Jordan Pearson, without explaining his choice of the Communist Manifesto (it is estimated that communist regimes around the world have killed almost 100 million people.) Blockstream community manager Dan Williams told Vice about his own favorite message. “The most fascinating message I’ve received was what appeared to be a journal from an anonymous developer in eastern Europe who shared his growing interest in Bitcoin and the technology surrounding it such as Blockstream Satellite and the Lightning Network,” he explained. The message itself is even better than it sounds. “So here I am, left my job, I have some money to keep me up and I’m building my first raspberry pi lightning node, and broadcasting messages from satellites. Still feels surreal at times,” part of the diary reads. #SatelliteAPI prose. 💯 🛰️⚡️👽 pic.twitter.com/oePSMVKojO Then, there are poems, and - of course - memes, except now they’re in encrypted form, like the so-called Rare Pepe. However, all of these were sent over the testnet, which made them free; with the mainnet now live, you will have to pay for the service. “I suspect given low message fees, it's easier  and simpler to pay with real BTC because it's actually hard to get Test BTC,” explained Blockstream co-founder and CEO Adam Back. And if you really have a message that you need to broadcast through space, is any fee too high?

The BTC/USD pair did correct lower recently and traded below the USD 3,850 level. It traded towards the USD 3,825 support and later rebounded above USD 3,850. Similarly, there was a downside extension in ethereum price below the USD 132 support before ETH buyers appeared near the USD 130 level. Ripple price declined below the USD 0.310 support and tested the next key support at USD 0.306. The current price action (UTC 08:30 AM) is slightly bearish, but BTC and altcoins are trading near key supports, which may result in a decent recovery in the near term. Total market capitalization  There was a downside break below the USD 3,850 support in bitcoin price . However, there was no test of the USD 3,800 support and declines were contained near the USD 3,825 level. BTC/USD rebounded above USD 3,850, but it is facing a lot of hurdles near the USD 3,900 level.
If there is an upside break above USD 3,900, the price could revisit the USD 3,980 - USD 4,000 resistance area. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,825, below which the price could test the USD 3,800 support level in the near term. Ethereum price  declined below the USD 135 and USD 132 support levels. ETH/USD tested the USD 130 support and it is currently correcting above USD 132. An immediate resistance is at USD 135, followed by the USD 136 pivot level.
On the downside, the USD 132 level is an initial support. If there are more losses, sellers may attempt to clear the USD 130 support. Having said that, if ETH stays above USD 130, it could slowly climb above USD 135. Bitcoin cash price  declined below the USD 128 support and tested the USD 126 support. BCH/USD is currently consolidating losses and it seems like it could correct higher towards the USD 130 or USD 132 resistance.
EOS  tested the key USD 3.50 support level and bounced back. The price broke the USD 3.55 and USD 3.60 resistance levels. The next resistance is at USD 3.70, above which the price could move into a positive zone in the coming sessions.
Ripple price  extended losses below the USD 0.310 and USD 0.308 support levels. XRP/USD tested the USD 0.306 support level and later corrected above USD 0.308. If it clears the USD 0.310 and USD 0.312 resistances, buyers are likely to gain control. In the past two sessions, a few small cap altcoins gained a strong bullish momentum and rallied sharply, including GRS, CRO, R, GNT, QBIT, ARK, POWR and LOOM. Out of these, GRS rallied more than 140% and CRO is up close to 135%. To sum up, bitcoin traded close to the key USD 3,800 support and bounced back.

Ethereum price faced a strong resistance near the USD 140 level on many occasions, resulting in a bearish push below the USD 136 support level. Ripple price also struggled near the USD 0.320 resistance level and XRP declined towards the USD 0.310 support.

Coinstar owns more than 20,000 coin-counting machines in nine countries around the world, but bitcoin purchases will only be available at selected kiosks in the US for now. Further, purchases can only be made with US dollar bills, in any amount up to USD 2,500 for each 24-hour period. Coins and foreign currency are not accepted at this time, according to a statement published by Coinstar. Once the money is deposited into the machine, the customer will receive a voucher with a bitcoin redemption code. The customer will then need to go to Coinme’s website to open an account and redeem the bitcoin. “Bitcoin is now accessible at your local grocery store via Coinstar kiosks, and this offering will make it even easier for consumers to participate in this dynamic new economy,” Coinme’s co-founder Neil Bergquist said in a comment. Unfortunately, buying bitcoin for cash remains a fairly expensive option. Although the two companies do not go into detail on this subject, Coinme’s website reveals that there is a 4% fee to use the new service. Compared to the average buying fee at bitcoin ATMs in 2018, however, Coinme’s fee is certainly in the lower end of the spectrum. As Cryptonews.com reported last year, the average buy fee at Bitcoin ATM’s stood at 9.13%, according to Coinatmradar.com. That compares with Coinbase’s 1.49% fee for US users. These fees obviously come on top of the spread, or the difference between the buy and sell price of bitcoin on the exchange that is used. In other words, bitcoin ATMs may have a role in spreading awareness to a new audience, but it certainly doesn’t come cheap. Meanwhile, as reported in November, French fintech company Keplerk made it possible for tobacco shop customers in France to buy bitcoins. The initiative affects 24,000 tobacco shops in the country where bitcoins are offered as vouchers, which can be cashed in via Keplerk’s wallet.

The company claims that it has set a new record for transaction fee revenue by adding new customers like Dish Networks, HackerOne, and the State of Ohio. However, it didn't disclose its revenue. Stephen Pair, Co-founder and CEO of BitPay, said that “To process over USD 1 billion for a second year in a row despite Bitcoin’s large price drop shows that Bitcoin is being used to solve real pain points around the world.” Sean Rolland, Head of Product of BitPay, also adds, “Bitcoin has the network effect around the world and we are still extremely bullish on Bitcoin and the Bitcoin ecosystem.”  BitPay’s B2B [business-to-business] business also had a record year as it grew almost 255% from the previous year as law firms, data center providers, and IT vendors signed up to accept Bitcoin, the company stated without providing any financials. The company, which has been in business for more than seven years, has also set a record for reducing payment error rates. The dollar volume lost to cryptocurrency payment errors reportedly dropped from over 8% (in December 2017) to well under 1% of BitPay’s total dollar volume processed. Although the payment processor remains focused on Bitcoin, they have also added support for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), as well as stablecoins like the USD Coin (USDC), Gemini Dollar (GUSD), and Paxos Standard Token (PAX). In other improvements, BitPay also states that they have increased their number of employees by 78% in 2018, bringing it to close to 80 people. They have also raised USD 40 million in a Series B funding round led by investors such as Menlo Ventures, Capital Nine, G Squared and others, which brought the company’s total raised capital to over USD 70 million. As reported by Cryptonews.com, from February to August last year, the amount of bitcoin spent per month through 17 surveyed bitcoin payments processors ranged from around 16,500 to almost 20,000, only falling to around 14,500 in September. However, the number for September can still be revised upwards, as it happened earlier last year.  Also, BitPay has revealed that the average value of a retail purchase made using BTC has increased last year. In 2016, the average amount spent by someone buying something with bitcoin was USD 107.66, while in 2017 the average rose to USD 347.84. In 2018, by contrast, the average climbed to USD 682.23.  You can find data that breaks down spending by the type of purchase here. However, part of the community is still not a fan of BitPay. This is due to several reasons: back in August 2017, BitPay signed the New York Agreement, which wanted to put an end to Bitcoin’s long-lasting scaling debate by increasing the block capacity through activating Segregated Witness (SegWit2x) and then doubling the block size. However, most Bitcoin maximalists refused to sign this, especially as those who agreed had no intention of changing the name of the coin that would inevitably split off the Bitcoin blockchain. For all intents and purposes, the companies behind SegWit2x appeared to be set to claim this coin as the “real” Bitcoin, while the coin that follows the current Bitcoin protocol won’t be. Another problem that users have with BitPay is the matter of addresses. The company uses a special address format, which is incompatible with many wallets and is said to cause users to lose their funds when converting the address to something recognized.",26.690000000000055,1

BTC/USD declined below the USD 3,600 support and tested the key support at USD 3,550. The price must stay above the USD 3,550 support to recover in the near term. If not, there is a risk of a bearish break below USD 3,500 in the coming sessions.

On the other hand, if buyers fail to gain strength, there could be a sharp bearish reaction below USD 3,550, USD 3,500 and USD 3,480 in the near term. Ethereum price  tested the USD 116 and USD 118 support levels recently and stayed above the USD 115 pivot level.

Bitcoin cash price  is currently consolidating above the USD 120 and USD 122 support levels. An initial resistance is at USD 130, above which there are chances of a solid upward move towards the USD 140 and USD 145 levels.
EOS  is up around 1% and it is trading near the USD 2.40 level. On the upside, the main resistance is at USD 2.50 followed by USD 2.60.

However, BTC/USD failed to retain strength above the USD 3,650 level and later reacted to the downside. The main reason for the recent bearish moves was the postponed Ethereum Constantinople hard fork. ETH/USD dipped more than 6% and traded below the USD 125 support level. Ripple price also trimmed its recent gains and declined below USD 0.325 before buyers appeared near the USD 0.320 level. The current (UTC 08:20 AM) price action is slightly bearish, suggesting range moves in bitcoin and altcoins in the coming sessions. Total market capitalization  There was a rejection pattern formed near the USD 3,670 level and bitcoin price  declined below USD 3,600. BTC/USD even traded below the USD 3,550 level before it found support near USD 3,520. The price is down around 2% and it seems like it may struggle to move above the USD 3,600 and USD 3,650 resistance levels.
On the downside, the USD 3,520 level is a short term support, below which there is a risk of downside break below the USD 3,500 and USD 3,480 support levels in the near term. Ethereum price  made a sharp turn after the Constantinople hard fork was delayed. ETH/USD dipped below the USD 125 and USD 120 support levels. The pair tested the USD 115 support and later corrected a few points. 
The price is currently down around 6% and it is facing a lot of hurdles on the upside near the USD 122 and USD 125 levels. On the downside, the USD 115 level is a strong support followed by USD 112. Bitcoin cash price  failed to break the USD 135 resistance and declined below the USD 130 support. BCH/USD is currently trading near the USD 125 level, with support at USD 122 and USD 120. The main resistances are USD 130 and USD 135.
EOS  is still above the USD 2.25 and USD 2.30 support levels, but it is facing a lot of offers near the USD 2.45 and USD 2.50 levels. 
Ripple price  dipped below the USD 0.330 and USD 0.325 support levels to enter a bearish zone. XRP/USD tested the USD 0.315 support and recovered above USD 0.320. However, it must settle above USD 0.325 and USD 0.330 for a sustained upward move. Despite recent bearish moves in bitcoin and ethereum, a few small cap altcoins gained more than 8%, including AE, WAX, STRAT, POWR and ZIL. Out of these, AE gained more than 22% and WAX is up close to 21%. To sum up, the recent decline in bitcoin price below USD 3,600 shifted the market sentiment. To start a fresh bullish wave, the price must settle above USD 3,600 and USD 3,650. If not, there is a risk of more losses in BTC, ethereum, ripple and other altcoins lower in the near term.

This means that the miners are coming back, creating a more competitive environment. However, some players in the mining industry still need to deal with certain challenges. It was previously estimated that the mining difficulty, the adjustment of which was set for end of December 2018, would drop by 8.22%. However, data from major Bitcoin mining pool BTC.com shows that the difficulty on December 31st actually increased by 10.03% at that time, and again two weeks later, at the next adjustment, by 4.72%. Now, the pool estimates that the difficulty will increase by another 4.35% in almost 13 days. 10 recent Bitcoin mining difficulty adjustments: The mining difficulty of Bitcoin is adjusted every two weeks (every 2016 blocks, to be precise) to maintain the normal 10-minute block time. This means that if there are many miners competing amongst themselves and propagating blocks in less than ten minutes, the difficulty of the next puzzle will be increased; if there are few miners and it takes them much longer to find a solution, the difficulty is decreased - both times just enough to keep block times at around 10 minutes. To further add to the proof that miners are turning their rigs back on, the hash rate is also growing: in the past month, it is up from some 36.5k TH/s to around 42k TH/s, an increase of around 13%.  Bitcoin hash rate: _____
Bitcoin price chart: Moreover, small miners are increasing their share in the Bitcoin network, which helps boost decentralization. Unknown miners closed December having solved 22% of the total blocks up from 6% at the start of the year, according to weekly cryptocurrency publication Diar. The Bitcoin network is currently even less likely to experience a 51% attack given the fact the BTC.com controlled pools have lost dominance over the network, instead spreading the mining power over smaller participants. However, Bitcoin mining is expensive business, and not just due to the cost of the hardware rigs required. The amount of electricity spent is often the cause for incredibly high bills - and that’s without governments additionally increasing the cost of electricity spent on mining operations. As of April 1st, power rates for cryptocurrency firms will go up by 15% in Washington. This is scheduled to go up by another 35% in 2020, and another 50% in 2021. Now, according to the Grant County public utility district (PUD), nine cryptocurrency firms have filed suit at the US District Court of Eastern Washington for imposing an “evolving industry” rate that targets mining operations. Things are getting increasingly difficult for some other mining industry companies as well. Meanwhile, Bitmain, the world’s largest mining hardware maker and operator of the two major Bitcoin mining pools, is seeing their share of trouble, too. The company has announced another round of layoffs, after they were rumored to have lost over USD 700 million in Q4 2018. They closed down their Israeli branch and fired all of its employees, which was followed by reports by Chinese media that Bitmain CEOs Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan are set to step down. The new cuts are happening in Amsterdam, Netherlands and Rockdale, Texas - both of which are losing all Bitmain operations located there. Moreover, US-based Bitcoin mining company Giga Watt is finally going out of business after declaring bankruptcy in November 2018, and the company’s token will become worthless, CCN reported. The firm lasted a little over a year, launching with an initial coin offering in September 2017. The reason for this are unpaid power bills, according to the report. As reported by Cryptonews.com, Giga Watt had filed for bankruptcy in Washington in November, still owing creditors nearly USD 7 million.",-73.53999999999996,0

Later, BTC/USD started an upside correction and traded above the USD 3,600 and USD 3,620 resistance levels. Similarly, ethereum price formed a solid support above USD 115 and bounced back above USD 120 and  USD 125. Ripple price also performed well and managed to settle above the USD 0.325 levels. These are early positive signs, but the market must recover further to overcome selling pressure. If not, there is a risk of bitcoin and altcoins moving back in a bearish zone. Total market capitalization  There was a decent upward move above the USD 3,500 and USD 3,600 resistances in bitcoin price . BTC/USD even traded above the USD 3,650 level, but it failed to hold gains and later started a short term downside correction. An initial support is near the USD 3,600 level, below which the price may retest the USD 3,550 level.
On the upside, the first hurdle for buyers is near the USD 3,680 level, above which the price must settle above USD 3,700 for an acceleration towards the USD 3,800 level. Ethereum price  gained more than 8% recently and moved above the USD 120 and USD 125 resistance levels. ETH/USD tested the USD 130 resistance and it is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) consolidating gains. 
Buyers need to push the price above USD 130 and USD 132 for more gains towards the USD 140 level. On the downside, the USD 125 level is an initial support, below which the price may drop back to USD 120. Bitcoin cash price  found support and recovered above the USD 125 and USD 130 levels. However, BCH/USD seems to be struggling above USD 130 and it could decline once again towards the USD 122 - USD 124 zone. On the flip side, a break above USD 130 - USD 132 could lead the price towards USD 140.
EOS  rallied above the USD 2.20 and USD 2.40 levels. It traded close to the USD 2.50 resistance and later corrected below USD 2.40. The key support is at USD 2.35 and USD 2.32.
Ripple price  gained traction above the USD 0.310 support and jumped above the USD 0.320 and USD 0.325 resistance levels. XRP/USD may continue higher if it surpasses the USD 0.330 resistance level. Many small cap altcoins gained bullish momentum and recovered more than 10%, including REP, QKC, LINK, REPO, STRAT, NPXS, MANA, WAX, MKR, THETA and DCN. Out of these, REP is up around 25% and QKC gained close to 25%. Overall, bitcoin price recovered nicely above USD 3,500 and USD 3,600, but it must extend gains above the USD 3,700 barrier to move into a bullish zone. If BTC/USD fails to hold gains above USD 3,500, it could drag ethereum, ripple and other altcoins lower in the near term.

Russia’s Bitcoin investment is a step to minimize US sanctions on the country. Vladislav Ginko, an economist at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, said the Bitcoin investment was a step taken to avoid US sanctions on Russia. Ginko believes that Russia’s decision to hold Bitcoin as a reserve currency instead of the US dollar is a move being made to “protect [Russia’s] national interests” in light of a possible interruption of “US nominated payments flows for Russian oil and gas.” Russia’s Bitcoin investment is expected to begin in February. Mr. Ginko furthered: “[The] Russian government is about to make a step to start diversifying financial reserves into Bitcoin since Russia [is] forced by US sanctions to dump US Treasury bonds and [take] back US dollars […]These sanctions and the will to adopt modern financial technologies lead Russia to the way of investing its reserves into Bitcoin.” US sanctions have hit the Russian rouble hard. Now the superpower wants to replace some of its US dollar reserves with the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap. >> Are Stablecoins the Future? The Winklevoss Twins Seem to Think So! Recent US sanctions on Russia came after the poisoning of former Russian military officer Sergei Skripal in London. The former Russian military officer was a double agent for the UK’s Intelligent Services. Two active Russian military intelligent officers attacked Sergei and his daughter Yulia, with a nerve agent. Cryptocurrencies are very popular in Russia and even receive approval by the country’s President Vladimir Putin. According to Ginko, the cryptocurrency industry accounts for 8% of Russia’s GDP. The Bitcoin investment is not the only sign of ‘de-dollarisation’ by the country. It has recently bolstered its supply of the euro, Chinese renminbi, and Japanese yen.

However, a new research findings suggest volatility might even increase. At the same time, Japanese regulators deny they’re considering approving crypto ETF.  According to the Boston-based crypto analytics provider Flipside Crypto, a large number of bitcoin holders who haven’t touched their coins for more than two and a half years are now starting to move. Speaking with Bloomberg, Flipside Crypto’s head of data science, Eric Stone, said the supply of “active bitcoins” in the market has increased by 40% since the summer of 2018. The trend has now moved so far that around 60% of the entire bitcoin supply is currently being held by wallets that have been active in the last 30 days. According to Stone, the same phenomena also occurred prior to the large price swings in the bitcoin market in 2015 and 2017. As is well-known, that price move brought bitcoin to an all-time high of nearly 20,000 USD in 2017.  He further added that “It’s definitely a big shift [...] There’s more potential than usual for price swings.” The question now is whether that will be up or down. As previously reported, a new triangle-shaped chart pattern may signal lower prices ahead.  Moreover, despite the recent sell-off, New York based research company Delphi Digital confirmed yesterday that their previous forecast that Bitcoin to bottom out in the first quarter of this year still stands.  Bitcoin price chart: Meanwhile, cryptocurrency researcher Willy Woo thinks that bitcoin is still looking for the bottom: To balance out my pessimism, here's a summary to the bull side by @renato_shira. Many of our on-chain indicators suggest the bottom may be near. While I don't concur with this conclusion, I like the analysis, it's a good summary of the bull case.https://t.co/Qp2A5OjebF In separate news, a spokesperson from Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) told News.bitcoin.com, that “there is no such fact that we are considering approving [Bitcoin] ETFs which track crypto-assets at present […] we are not currently considering approving them.” According to the spokesperson, the agency is of the opinion “that there is no need for trading crypto-assets derivatives at financial instruments exchanges where many market participants are able to trade.” The spokesperson was responding to a report by Bloomberg that the FSA is currently gauging industry interest in ETFs tracking digital currencies.",148.74000000000024,1

Despite the recent sell-off, New York based research company Delphi Digital confirmed yesterday that their previous forecast that Bitcoin to bottom out in the first quarter of this year still stands. This time, the company published analysis of bitcoin holders to explain the process by which they concluded this. ""We’ve established that selling pressure from long term holders is significantly tapped, and accumulation has begun,"" the company said in the report.  The process uses UTXO age dynamics to figure out when long term holders will stop the selling pressure. UTXO stands for the unspent output from bitcoin transactions, while the UTXO age indicates the last time bitcoin was moved.   ""Bitcoin's aggregate UTXO age distribution over time provides insight into buying and selling patterns through previous market cycles, along with where we stand now, and what we can likely expect moving forward,"" the researchers explained. Separating HODLers who haven’t moved their funds in over a year from those who haven’t moved it in longer timeframes, they conclude that most of the selling pressure comes from 3 to 5 year hodlers with a caveat: “An important understanding that allows this to work is that a large portion of the coins in the 5 year+ band are lost.” 7/ Based on the points below, we can presume that most selling came from 3-5 Year holders. An important understanding that allows this to work is that a large portion of the coins in the 5 year+ band are lost. Please refer to the full report for an explanation of each assumption. pic.twitter.com/1IXmsJV9gw The company then explains, “Another important takeaway is we can assume these older owners have exhausted much of their selling efforts, evident in the flattening of these older UTXO bands, coupled with the 1 Year UTXO band reaching a floor and staying flat through the first half of 2018.” The graphs point to an accumulation process that is similar to what happened at the end of 2014, implying a bottom in sight.  They further add that there are strong correlations between the current situation and historical figures, especially the end of 2014 and the end of 2018: “With this data, we can estimate the date of these events. A uniformity across both cycles was the slope from the base of the 1 Year+ line to its peak [...] The date and UTXO floor holding rate, which will occur during the next selloff, are the remaining factors that are needed to complete the cycle. It's difficult to be confident in a forecast this far out, but our estimates have the next UTXO floor occurring in Q4 2022.” This new UTXO floor could be the foreshadowing of the next bottom, should the pattern stay consistent. The previous research, published by the company back in December, drew a parallel between 2013 and 2017, as the price’s rise of late 2017 mimics that of 2013, where peak valuations were followed by an extended bear market, characterized by multiple relief rallies on the way to drastically lower prices, but the bottom does not seem to be too far off. Meanwhile, an informal poll in the beginning of last autumn showed that usually very cautious Wall Street investors were calling a bottom in the bitcoin market. Twitter users, however, were more skeptical. As for the current state of the market, CEO of cryptocurrency company Circle, Jeremy Allaire, explained during a recent AMA (Ask Me Anything) session on Reddit: “My general perception is that the markets have been oversold and that some core assets have decoupled from their usage, which suggests they are undervalued. We look at things like hashrate health, on-chain activity, as key indicators of usage and adoption and underlying unit economic support."" As reported by Cryptonews.com, as discouraging as recent market events may be for anyone hoping that Bitcoin will 'go to the Moon,' there are other measures of the cryptocurrency's health, and these reveal that it's doing better than many people currently think.",13.349999999999909,1

If BTC/USD breaks the USD 3,500 support, sellers are likely to push the price towards USD 3,200. Besides, ethereum and ripple could also extend declines if they fail to stay above the USD 120 and USD 0.320 supports respectively.

An ETF is a platform that tracks and trades an asset in the same way as stocks are traded on an exchange. Will Bitwise manage to succeed where so many others are failing? Bitwise’s proposal is for an ETF that tracks the value of Bitcoin via the Bitwise Bitcoin Total Return Index. This value is “calculated based on the prices of Bitcoin that the Index Provider derives from Bitcoin price transactions occurring on cryptocurrency exchanges.” Basically, the index will take Bitcoin’s value from a variety of crypto exchanges and will, therefore, offer a more accurate and precise market value for the coin. This is one difference that Bitwise’s ETF proposal offers that previous ETF proposals—which have all been rejected—did not. Another difference on offer with Bitwise’s ETF proposal is that it would need “regulated third-party custodians to hold its physical bitcoin.” The company’s Global Head of ETFs, John Hyland, spoke of this in the press release: “Having a regulated bank or trust company hold physical assets of a fund has been the standard under US fund regulation for the last 80 years, and we believe that is now possible with Bitcoin.” >> Ethereum Classic Attack: Gate.io Will Return Most Funds Bitwise is still awaiting a decision from the SEC on a previously filed ETF that would track the Bitwise HOLD 10 Private Index Fund. The approval of a crypto ETF has yet to happen, although the industry has been crying out for one.

Although the sentiment surrounding bitcoin has been boosted by renewed hopes after a gain of almost 30% since the bottom in mid-December, a new triangle-shaped chart pattern may signal lower prices ahead, analyst Jesse Colombo at Clarity Financial, Houston-based registered investment advisor firm, wrote on Tuesday. According to Colombo, bitcoin has just formed another triangle pattern, following the previous big triangle pattern that ended with a breakout to the downside on November 14 last year. The way Colombo sees it, the new chart set-up should be seen as a continuation pattern in the currency bearish trend. The number one cryptocurrency “is likely to make another big move once a breakout occurs,” Colombo wrote in the update, while adding that “bitcoin is still in a confirmed downtrend and a breakdown from this pattern would likely foreshadow the cryptocurrency hitting the low thousands or even under USD 1,000, eventually.” The analyst, who claims correctly predicted the fall below the important USD 6,000 level in October, further wrote: “If bitcoin breaks down from the current triangle, the downtrend will continue as the digital currency further erases its gains made during the 2017 cryptocurrency bubble.” “For now, I am watching which way Bitcoin breaks out from the triangle that is currently forming,” he concluded. Meanwhile, Travis Kling, founder of the crypto hedge fund Ikigai, told Bloomberg that “it’s unlikely that the bottom is in for Bitcoin” as ""the preponderance of evidence leads us to believe that we’ll see more lows before we head higher."" Bloomberg also refers to GTI VERA Bands Indicator, a technical measure, which suggests that Bitcoin is on the brink of a large move. However, it's direction is not clear yet. Also, on Tuesday, DoubleLine Capital CEO Jeffrey Gundlach said that a move to USD 5,000 for bitcoin is possible, CNBC reported. However, he did not specify when it may happen.  “I don’t recommend anything with bitcoin, really… but if you really want to speculate, I think it could make it to USD 5,000. Talk about an easy 25%,” Gundlach was quoted as saying. As reported last week, data from a DailyFX research note showed that 80% of traders with a position in bitcoin are on the long side – meaning they have positioned themselves for higher prices. This is the highest level of optimism among bitcoin traders since November 2018. However, the danger is that these traders will be forced to sell if things do not turn out the way they expected. Today, bitcoin is down by more than 5% in the last 24 hours (UTC 07:26 AM.)  The recent bearish moves in BTC/USD below USD 3,850 are signaling an increase in selling pressure.

Later, BTC/USD recovered and traded above the USD 3,950, USD 3,975 and USD 4,000 levels. However, buyers failed to gain traction and later the price started trading in a range above USD 3,950. Ethereum also recovered a few points and tested the USD 150 resistance, with a bullish angle.

On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,950, which will most likely act as a pivot area. A close below USD 3,950 could spark bearish moves towards USD 3,925 and USD 3,880 in the near term.

Out of these, HOT rallied more than 24% and NPXS is up around 16%. Clearly, the price action is positive for bitcoin above the USD 3,925 and USD 3,950 support levels. Still, a successful close and follow through above USD 4,000 is must for BTC/USD buyers to gain momentum. Similarly, if ethereum gains strength above USD 155, ETH/USD may rally towards the USD 165 and USD 170 levels.

The Litecoin founder isn’t shy when it comes to voicing his opinion on crypto via Twitter and yesterday was no different. It seems this time, he’s targeting Bitcoin maximalists. It all started with a poll. Some self-proclaimed Bitcoin Maximalists are actually Bitcoin Extremists. They think all other coins are scams and will go to zero. Maximalists think Bitcoin is and will remain the dominant cryptocurrency but there is room for altcoins to exist and even do well. What are you? — Charlie Lee [LTC⚡] (@SatoshiLite) January 6, 2019  It seems Mr. Lee isn’t happy with a group of self-proclaimed Bitcoin maximalists. The Litecoin founder goes even as far as calling them “extremists,” which isn’t generally a positive thing to call someone. In 23 hours, Charlie Lee has collected over 28,000 votes on his poll and Bitcoin maximalist has taken over the majority of it. At press time, Bitcoin extremist has 9%, altcoin maximalist has 33%, and nocoiner has 10%. That leaves the remaining 48% to individuals who deem themselves Bitcoin maximalists. Traditionally, maximalists believe that Bitcoin (BTC) is the top cryptocurrency and the one to use day-to-day. Where Lee seems upset is that a group of these maximalists have attacked his own project and feel there is no space for any altcoins in the industry. This is what prompted the Twitter poll and attack on these so-called “extremists.” Others had their own take on the poll and subject, as usual. ""Supremacists"" has a more negative connotation… In recent years, ""extremists"" has been used more and more to simply mean ""someone who actually believes what they say they do"". — Luke Dashjr (@LukeDashjr) January 7, 2019  Another person actually knocking Litecoin said: I've always thought you seemed like a super good person and for a time I accumulated LTC. That being said I sold all my LTC this year for Bitcoin, and that was not out of ideology. It was a selfish, financial calculation I made because I don't see an enduring reason for LTC. — John Fever [sold BCH at $6K] (@ProgrammableTx) January 6, 2019  Not sure why the person above bought Litecoin because they thought Charlie Lee was a “good person” but that’s probably someone that shouldn’t be investing—just my opinion. Binance’s CEO even joined into the conversation. >> Monero “Mistake”—Now You Can’t Pay for Fortnite Merch with Monero Will be interesting to see how this plays out. But I believe in thousands of blockchain sand millions of tokens. Freedom implies choice. — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) January 7, 2019  From all the rest of the conversation via the initial tweet, it seems Lee isn’t the one who made up the term Bitcoin maximalists. He took that from Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder. It remains unclear why Bitcoin (BTC) supporters need to be placed into a category, but the altcoin leaders, like Charlie Lee, obviously feel it’s necessary. According to CoinMarketCap, BTC broke over the $4,00 threshold recently and is currently trading at $4,044.75 a coin, down – $0.97%, in 24 hours. Featured Image: Depositphotos © GekaSkr

The prize, which started as BTC 0.26 earlier today, is now (UTC 01:19 PM) worth BTC 0.2849 (USD 1,142.)  The mural is a play on the iconic Eugène Delacroix work Liberty Leading the People and shows Lady Liberty leading a group of Gilets Jaunes protesters into confrontation as she holds the French flag in the air, and is the work of artist Pascal Boyart, who is often dubbed the French Banksy (a famous anonymous England-based street artist.) Hidden inside the mural is the private key to the prize, to which anyone can donate to increase the amount, but not everyone can participate: Boyart told his Twitter followers that they would need to physically be in Paris and actually in front of the mural in order to take part in the hunt. #StreetArt treasure hunt in Paris with a #Bitcoin puzzle For the 10th birthday of the genesis block, I painted this frescoe in Paris with a 0,26btc ($1000) puzzle in it. Here's the public key: 1NqPwPp7hEXZ3Atj77Ue11xAEMmXqAXwrQ  Thanks to @alistairmilne for sponsoring this 🙏 pic.twitter.com/F7aIkxmp6t The location, which had not been disclosed previously, has been discovered by Twitter user @TZTaughtMe, who claims to be the first person there, later joined by two journalists who were not participating in the treasure hunt. The hunt officially began around 12 hours ago, when Boyart both tweeted and posted his artwork to Reddit. In the comments to his official Reddit post, he revealed that people who cannot physically be there can still solve only a part of the puzzle from behind their computer screens.  One significant difference between the mural and the piece it was inspired by is the fact that Boyart decided to forego showing Lady Liberty’s breasts, instead painting a sort of bra over them. This led some in the community to speculate that this is where the puzzle’s solution could be hidden, accessible by removing part of the painting with acetone or similar chemicals. Still, many others hope that there will be no need to alter the panting to solve the puzzle. This is not the first puzzle to feature a reward in crypto. Several have already risen to prominence, and perhaps the best-known among them is The Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto, a visual puzzle associated with the Bitcoin address 1FLAMEN6 that was created in 2015 with 5 BTC locked in. It was finally solved three years later, having previously been dubbed “fiendishly difficult”, by a programmer who hadn’t even heard of it until a month before finally cracking it.",-53.340000000000146,0

The FSA is currently gauging industry interest in ETFs tracking digital currencies, Bloomberg reported, citing ""a person familiar with the agency’s thinking."" It is estimated that such ETFs in Japan could revive appetite from retail investors. Japan’s ETF market is worth USD 335 billion (with about 75% owned by the central bank), compared with the USD 3.7 trillion worth of ETFs outstanding in the U.S., according to the report. So far, U.S. and European regulators have not approved ETFs, citing worries about price manipulation or the security of the underlying crypto assets. Securities lawyer and cryptocurrency commentator Jake Chervinsky estimates that the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) will never let a Bitcoin ETF happen. Commenting on the rumors that this instrument might soon go public, Chervinsky said that ""a proposed rule change is auto-approved if the SEC doesn’t make a decision by the deadline, but in reality, it would never happen."" Not going to happen.https://t.co/9TAtxZthDV As for ETFs themselves, some experts do not trust them either. Tyrone Ross, a Managing Partner of NobleBridge Wealth, an investment management and strategic wealth planning firm, said that he wasn’t a fan of Bitcoin ETF, and wouldn’t let his clients “go near it.” He is certain that cryptocurrencies inside of an ETF would only confuse people who don’t understand crypto or ETFs that well to begin with. And he is not alone. Andreas Antonopoulos, a Bitcoin evangelist and serial entrepreneur, also thinks ETFs are a terrible idea and that they “fundamentally violate the underlying principle of peer-to-peer money, where each user is operating not through a custodian but has direct control of their money, because they have direct control of their keys.” He warns that Bitcoin ETF might become an instrument to manipulate bitcoin prices. In the meantime, physically delivered bitcoin futures have been the buzzword in the crypto world lately, with Bakkt and Eris Exchange LLC expected to start offering such contracts early 2019. Moreover, CoinfloorEX (formerly a unit of the UK Bitcoin exchange Coinfloor, and now to be called Coin Futures and Lending Exchange - CoinFLEX), intends to offer the derivatives of some of the largest cryptocurrencies to Asian retail investors as early as February, Bloomberg reported on Monday.",-53.340000000000146,0

BTC/USD gained bullish momentum and broke the USD 3,850 and USD 4,000 resistance levels. It is currently (UTC 08:00 AM) placed in an uptrend and it could continue to move higher towards the USD 4,150, USD 4,200 and USD 4,400 resistance levels. Ethereum settled above the USD 145 and USD 150 resistance levels. ETH/USD must clear the USD 160 - USD 162 barrier for an upside extension. Ripple price is gaining strength and it recently broke the USD 0.370 resistance. More importantly, litecoin rallied nearly 10% and broke the USD 35 and USD 38 resistances. The current market sentiment is positive and there could be more gains in bitcoin and altcoins. Total market capitalization  There was a solid upward move in bitcoin price  above the USD 3,800 and USD 3,850 resistance levels. BTC/USD even cleared the USD 4,000 weekly resistance to move further into a positive zone. In the short term, there could be a downside correction, but the price remains well supported near USD 3,850 and USD 3,650.
On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 4,050, above which the price may target the next weekly barrier near the USD 4,250 level. Above this last, the price may continue to move higher towards USD 4,400. Ethereum price  remained in an uptrend above the USD 140 support. ETH/USD broke the USD 150 resistance and it is currently trading in a range. 
The price must break the USD 160 - USD 162 weekly resistance to set the pace for more gains. The next hurdle for buyers is near the USD 175 level. On the downside, the main supports are USD 145 and USD 140. Bitcoin cash  gained traction and moved above the USD 160 resistance, but it seems to be struggling to clear the USD 165 and USD 170 resistance levels. BCH/USD may correct a few points, but dips remain supported near the USD 155 and USD 150 levels. Bitcoin SV is trading flat near the USD 88 - USD 90 zone. A break above the USD 90 resistance could clear the path for more gains in the near term.
Ripple price  gained more than 7% recently and it broke the USD 0.365 and USD 0.370 resistance levels. XRP/USD might continue to trade higher if buyers push the price above USD 0.375 and USD 0.380. During the past few sessions, many small cap altcoins gained more than 10%, including DEX, BCZERO, DGTX, HOT, BTC, WTC, NEO and DCN. Out of these, DEX rallied close to 100% and BCZERO is up around 26%. To sum up, bitcoin price is showing positive signs above the USD 3,850 pivot level. If BTC/USD accelerates above USD 4,050, the next stop could be USD 4,200 or even USD 4,400. Similarly, ethereum, ripple and litecoin are likely preparing for more upsides in the coming sessions.

Data from a DailyFX research note shows that 80% of traders with a position in bitcoin are on the long side – meaning they have positioned themselves for higher prices. According to Marketwatch, this is the highest level of optimism among bitcoin traders since November 2018. According to research analyst Fan Xu at DailyFX, this gives a long-to-short ratio – the ratio between those who are betting on higher prices and those who are betting on lower prices – of 3.44 to 1. There are a few possible reasons for this, but most of all it appears to be a result of renewed optimism after bitcoin and other major coins have surged since mid-December. For ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform, the surge has been particularly strong with a gain of almost 90% since its low on December 14. Bitcoin, on its end, has recorded a gain of roughly 20% since its mid-December low. Bitcoin price chart: Assuming the trading data from DailyFX is correct, it would mean that the long side of the bitcoin trade is now getting quite “crowded,” with a very large number of traders expecting that prices will move higher.  The danger then, is that these traders will be forced to sell if things do not turn out the way they expected. This situation is often characterized as a “long squeeze,” as opposed to the typical “short squeezes” we have seen so many times in bitcoin this year. What is going to happen this time is of course impossible to tell with certainty, but according to DailyFX’s analyst, traders should be wary: “We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests bitcoin prices may continue to fall. Traders are further net-long than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger bitcoin-bearish contrarian trading bias,” she wrote.",25.679999999999836,1

Of course, the cryptoverse has taken to the internet to celebrate this day, from simply wishing Bitcoin a happy birthday, over going through all the events that brought Bitcoin to where it is today, to ideas on how to celebrate this birthday in a meaningful way.  If you’ve been reading up on the interesting tidbits about Bitcoin’s history, you may know that the genesis block of Bitcoin contains the text “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,” as this was the headline of The Times newspaper on that day. Now, ten years later, that very same newspaper is featuring Bitcoin on the bottom of its front page thanks to cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, where the writing says, “Thanks, Satoshi. We owe you one. Happy 10th birthday, Bitcoin.”  ____ Today's Times newspaper (3rd January 2019) celebrates Bitcoin's 10th BirthdayIncluded on the front page is the hash of the Bitcoin block 554,509. Thanks to @JihanWu  and @btccom_official for including the message ""ThanksSatoshi"" in the Coinbase inputhttps://t.co/HFskR9J6Jv pic.twitter.com/QtSRvI6wNo Included is the hash of the Bitcoin block 554,509, mined today, and co-founder of mining rig manufacturer Bitmain, Jihan Wu, and Bitcoin wallet and major mining pool BTC.com teamed up to have that block include the phrase “Thanks Satoshi” in honor of Bitcoin’s 10th birthday.  Also, it looks like the today's issue of The Times might become extremely popular: Picked myself up 10 copies. Potential to moon 10/10. If you're not lucky to buy one, you can read the article, published in the newspaper, online. And here you can find sellers of the original Bitcoin Genesis Block newspaper, but be ready to pay at least USD 50,000 per copy.   The phrase that Satoshi Nakamoto included on that day was not a purely spontaneous decision: a decade later, it proves that the genesis block was created on the same day the network was released, which means that Satoshi couldn’t have built up a secretly premined chain, undermining the network. However, YouTuber and crypto influencer Ivan on Tech adds another meaning to that phrase: “That's the reason Bitcoin exists. Bitcoin is the cure.” And Reddit user u/jam-hay reminds us that Bitcoin is stronger than ever ten years after its inception: “For years we have had to put up with condescending mainstream media, finance and political pundits sneering at the very thought that a group of volunteer developers could somehow create a free, open-source, decentralized and secure way for everyday people to store and send value to each other almost instantly.. all over the planet and beyond. 10 years on and we have over 2,000+ cryptocurrencies, 16,000+ markets and a combined market cap of $130bn [...] This new wave of Fintech spawned by Satoshi will do to the banking sector, what online shopping has done to brick and mortar shops.” There is also a countdown to the exact time when Bitcoin’s birthday falls: 18:15 GMT. Joining the celebration is Didi Taihuttu, best known as the man who sold almost everything he owned, poured it into bitcoin and moved his family into a trailer park. In his congratulations, he is joined by the rest of his family from their trailer. 🎉 Happy Birthday Bitcoin 🎉 Don't lose faith in #Bitcoin because of the price.

Today is also the day when the Proof of Keys event is set to happen for the first time, dubbed the yearly HODLer initiation, when users withdraw their bitcoins from exchanges in order to prove ownership over them. The event is mostly being celebrated, as well as endorsed by many influencers in the community, but there are also those warning that it could all go very wrong. Among outspoken supporters of the Proof of Keys event are even people from cryptocurrency exchanges such as ShapeShift and Coinbase, while the CEO of the largest cryptocurrency exchange with fees Binance, Changpeng Zhao, says he has no opinion about the event: I don't have an opinion.  I know we are #safu.   We will provide what the market needs.  Feel free to do whatever you wish. Meanwhile, Balaji S. Srinivasan, Chief Technology Officer of Coinbase, tweeted instructions on how to send your crypto from Coinbase exchange to Coinbase (or other) wallet.  The point is not to send them back. But to hold your own keys so that you don’t have to trust exchanges. Which is the point of crypto. If you leave your crypto on exchanges you do not own them. Nice try though. Manufacturers of hardware wallets, which ensure that you own your private keys, also took a chance to remind about themselves: Tomorrow is the “Proof of Keys” day – this event entails sending your crypto assets to an address where you own the private keys. This initiative is in line with the popular phrase “Not your keys, not your Bitcoin”.Read more on it here: https://t.co/xlhJc7foVP#ProofOfKeys ShapeShift went a step further. In a blog post titled, “Why We Support #ProofofKeys and You Should, Too,” they went on to explain their opinion: “Bottom line: if you use an exchange versus a cold storage option, such as a hardware wallet, you’ll have to have complete third-party trust that the exchange is holding the funds that they say they are. When your cryptocurrencies are stored on a hardware wallet, you’re in complete control of your crypto.” Another institution supporting the event is Weiss Ratings, a veteran firm dedicated to analyzing investments. “‘Proof of Keys’ that is due tomorrow, will force exchanges to prove they actually have reserves of crypto they claim they own. #Crypto was designed to remove all intermediaries between people and their money, so we stand behind this initiative,” the company tweeted yesterday.  Former Wall Street veterans are also throwing their support behind the initiative. Caitlin Long, who spent 22 years at Wall Street and is now a self-proclaimed blockchain and Bitcoin enthusiast, urged her followers to participate: “Tomorrow is #ProofOfKeys-Jan 3 on 10th anniv of #Bitcoin’s genesis block. If someone else has your private keys do you know if your #BTC is really there? No. Declare your monetary sovereignty by holding your private keys.” And when that FOMO (fear of missing out) truly kicks in, you can’t just let the event pass you by as if you’re not even part of the space.  I didn't have any #bitcoin kept on an exchange, but I bought some and withdrew it anyways to participate in #ProofOfKeys @TraceMayer @coinbase pic.twitter.com/xLY4TPV8NT And if you’d like everyone on the streets to know you’re supporting it, you can buy a cap, or a t-shirt sporting a design related to the event. However, we do not advise wearing an unbuttoned jacket to show off the t-shirt if you’re from the northern hemisphere, as we’re currently in the middle of winter here. Happy #SatoshiRun #ProofOfKeys #BeYourOwnBank, if you don’t control it, it ain’t yours.What a time to be alive :) pic.twitter.com/hSSUJL491T Of course, not everything is just fun and games: some people warn about possible scams and phishing attacks on this day as well. “Tomorrow a lot of scammers will be operating to steal your Bitcoin and take advantage of “proof of keys”. Expect phishing attacks, fake guides on how to get your coins off exchanges, creative scam Twitter/Google ad campaigns targeting the term “proof of keys”, etc. BE VIGILANT!” warns Twitter user @CobraBitcoin, co-owner of bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org. Twitter user @CanMind goes a step further with potential conspiracy theories: “This proof of keys has a potential to be a market manipulation strategy... Users pull cryptocurrencies from exchanges while the [whales] remain inside and play with the prices as they wish! Users try to come back but of course the gains have been made!!” he warned. Whether or not the event will influence the price remains to be seen, but many are already speculating about what could happen. “Most people are expecting the price to rise (even rise dramatically). This won't happen. The price of an asset almost always has the expectations of the masses already built into it, so the people who think that BTC's price will skyrocket tomorrow have already bought in so they won't be buying any more. [...] If the price starts to do a belly dive it will be immediately picked up by all the individuals that were hoping for a dive in order to get some cheap coins so it will be instantly pushed back up,” writes Reddit user u/taranasus. Others are looking at the bright side of the event. “#Proofofkeys allowed me to consolidate my bitcoin holdings. I found I had bitcoin in an exchange that I didn't use for 1 year. Thank you @TraceMayer for this great idea! Happy birthday bitcoin!” writes Twitter user @Godineau.  And of course, we would be very worried if a hyped event happened without jokes to follow it through. “I hope this doesn’t need to be said, but #ProofOfKeys does not mean to post screenshots of your private keys online,” writes @TheBitcoinSOV. And the possible reaction of insolvent exchanges was perfectly captured by @_dnov.

BTC/USD broke the USD 3,800 and USD 3,820 resistance levels, opening the doors for more gains. However, a successful close above the USD 4,000 barrier is needed for buyers to gain momentum. According to Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, a major bottom is near in bitcoin since there is a solid rise in adoption and people are getting more and more involved in the market, Bloomberg reported. Besides, the GTI Vera Convergence Divergence indicator is pointing a sharp increase in buying interest, it added. Therefore, if buyers succeed in clearing the USD 4,000 and USD 4,200 resistance levels, there could be more gains in the near term. Total market capitalization  A good support base is formed near the USD 3,700 level in bitcoin price . BTC/USD broke the USD 3,800 resistance area to set the pace for a test of the USD 3,900 and USD 3,925 resistance levels. The main resistance is near the USD 4,000 level, above which the price may climb toward the USD 4,200 level.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,800, below which the price is likely to test the USD 3,750 support (the previous resistance). The key support is at USD 3,700 and USD 3,680. Ethereum price  performed really well and traded above the USD 145 and USD 150 resistance levels. ETH/USD is up more than 10% and it is approaching the USD 152 and USD 154 resistance levels.
If the price corrects lower, it may find a strong support near the USD 146 and USD 144 levels. The major support is at USD 142, which was a significant resistance earlier.  Bitcoin cash price  gained more than 3% and broke the USD 165 resistance levels. BCH/USD may continue to move higher towards the USD 170 and USD 175 resistance levels. On the downside, supports are visible near the USD 160 and USD 158 levels. Bitcoin SV is trading flat near the USD 90 level. If there is a break above the USD 92 and USD 95 resistance, the price may test the USD 100 level.
Ripple price  moved above the USD 0.360 resistance and it may continue to rise towards the USD 0.365 and USD 0.370 resistances. The key support is at USD 0.360, below which the price may test USD 0.355. During the past few sessions, a few small cap altcoins traded up more than 8%, including LINK, REP, DCN, ICX, DGD, XIN and EOS. Out of these, LINK gained more than 20% and REP is up around 16%. To sum up, bitcoin price is slowly gaining momentum above the USD 3,800. If BTC/USD clears the USD 3,900 resistance, buyers may push the price above USD 4,000. The main driving force is ethereum, dragging bitcoin and other altcoins to the upside. If the current market sentiment stays intact, there could be more gains in bitcoin and altcoins.

However, buyers appeared near the USD 3,620 - USD 3,650 area and protected more declines. BTC/USD bounced back and traded above the USD 3,680 and USD 3,700 resistance levels. Similarly, ethereum price recovered from the USD 128 - USD 130 support and it seems to be preparing for an upward move towards the USD 150 resistance.

Total market capitalization  There was an upward move above the USD 3,700 support in bitcoin price . BTC/USD traded above the USD 3,750 resistance level and it is currently approaching the USD 3,800 resistance area. A break above the USD 3,800 and USD 3,820 resistance levels could open the doors for more gains towards the USD 3,860 and USD 3,900 levels.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,740, below which the price may perhaps test the USD 3,700 support. If there is a break below the USD 3,700 support, the price may test the USD 3,650 support. Ethereum price  gained pace above the USD 130 resistance and settled above the USD 135 level. ETH/USD must break the USD 140 - USD 142 resistance zone to trade towards the USD 148 and USD 150 resistance levels.
If there is a downside correction, the price may test the USD 135 support, below which the price may test the key USD 130 support.  Bitcoin cash price  settled above the USD 150 support it is currently attempting to clear the USD 160 - USD 162 resistance area. An immediate resistance is at USD 165, above which the price may test the USD 175 resistance. Bitcoin SV is currently trading above the USD 85 support and it may continue to rise towards the USD 95 support. On the downside, the key supports are at USD 85 and USD 80.
Ripple price  declined recently and tested the USD 0.345 support level. On the upside, a break above the USD 0.365 and USD 0.375 resistance levels is needed for more gains towards the USD 0.380 level. During the past few hours, a few small cap altcoins gained more than 8%, including DEX, BCZERO, STRAT, VERI, OMG and XIN. Out of these, DEX gained more than 30% and BCZERO rallied nearly 20%. Overall, bitcoin price is placed above the USD 3,700 support and it may continue to move higher in the near term. A proper break and close above USD 3,800 resistance could clear the path for more upsides in BTC/USD. Similarly, ethereum price could accelerate gains if there is a break above the USD 142 - USD 145 resistance area.

Ethereum price rallied recently above the USD 125 and 130 resistance. ETH/USD could gain traction if buyers clear the UD 140 resistance. Ripple price retreated from the USD 0.450 swing high and settled below USD 0.400. However, the price is finding strong bids near USD 0.345 and it might recover above USD 0.380 and USD 0.400. Total market capitalization  After testing the USD 3,500 support, bitcoin price  recovered above USD 3,600 and USD 3,700. BTC/USD is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) trading in a range above the USD 3,700 support, with an immediate resistance at USD 3,780. If there is a break above USD 3,780 and USD 3,800, the price could accelerate gains toward the USD 4,000 weekly resistance level.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,700, below which the next support is at USD 3,620. The main weekly support is at USD 3,500, below which sellers could target the USD 3,200 support area. Ethereum price  formed a solid support near the USD 115 - USD 120 zone and later rallied above USD 125. ETH/USD even broke the USD 130 resistance, but it struggled to gain momentum above the USD 140 resistance. 
Buyers need to clear the USD 140 level to test the weekly resistance at USD 150. On the downside, the first support is at USD 130, below which the main weekly support is at USD 125. If there is a push below USD 125, the price could trade back in a bearish zone. Bitcoin cash  settled above USD 150 support. BCH/USD must break the USD 165 and USD 175 resistance levels to challenge the USD 200 barrier in the coming days. Bitcoin SV is struggling to hold gains above USD 90 and it is currently down 2% to USD 85. If BCHSV continues to move down, it may test the USD 80 or USD 75 support level.
Ripple price  traded sharply lower from the USD 0.450 swing high. XRP/USD tested the USD 0.325 support and later recovered above USD 0.350. The next key resistance for buyers is near the USD 0.380 and USD 0.392 levels. Recently, a few small cap altcoins gained bullish momentum and traded up by more than 8%, including MGO, DCN, IOST, KMD and MOAC. Out of these, MGO gained more than 17% to USD 0.51 and DCN is up around 14%. Overall, bitcoin price is trading above the key USD 3,500 support. If BTC/USD breaks the USD 3,800 and USD 3,880 resistance levels, it could clear the USD 4,000 barrier.

The attack resulted in Electrum wallet apps showing a message on users' computers, urging them to download a malicious wallet update from an unauthorized GitHub (a software development platform) repository. There is an ongoing phishing attack against Electrum users. Our official website is https://t.co/aHiZIZH54e Do not download Electrum from any other source. More on the attack here: https://t.co/x5mPVspKfO The attack has stopped today, at least temporarily, after GitHub admins took down the hacker's GitHub repository. However, admins of the Electrum wallet expect a new attack to soon get underway, with either a new GitHub repo or a link to another download location altogether, according to Zdnet.  This attack was made possible by a vulnerability in the wallet itself, which lets Electrum servers trigger popups with custom text inside users' wallets. This means that the attackers were able to tell users to download their malicious software, which in turn prompted them to enter a two-factor authentication code (2FA), used to later steal the funds: One the victims of the theft took to Reddit to write about their ordeal:  ""I have used electrum a lot, here is how this went down tonight. I log onto my electrum where I have about 1.4xx btc that I was trying to send. When i attempt to send I get a strange message that says ""in order to send please update to the latest version here: https://github.com/electrum-project/electrum"" now this link was weird for two reasons, first off it is not the official link from the electrum site and second it didn't allow me to click it like normal links do/would. I had to copy/paste it into my browser window. I did that and proceeded to download the application here, when I logged on it immediately asked me for my 2 factor code which I thought was a little strange as well as Electrum usually only asks for that when you attempt to send. I kept trying to send and kept getting an error code ""max fee exceeded no more than 50 sat/B"" I then restored my wallet on a separate pc and found that my balance had been transferred out in full to this address: https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/14MVEf1X4Qmrpxx6oASqzYzJQZUwwG7Fb5.""  However, from this address, more than 200 BTC have been sent to an address that holds 243.59 BTC as of the time of writing. After receiving news of attacks, the Electrum team responded by ""silently updating"" the Electrum wallet app, so these messages - like the one urging the download of the malicious code - don't render as rich HTML text anymore, according to SomberNight, a developer at the Electrum wallet team. The developer wrote on GitHub that Electrum developers have currently identified at least 33 malicious Electrum servers that have been added to their network, but the number appears to be around 40-50. Protecting yourself from such attacks can be difficult, but in this particular case, a single red flag can be distinguished: the app asked for a 2FA code at wallet startup, whereas 2FA is usually only needed before a transaction. This is similar to a service asking you for your credit card details when you’re doing anything but paying - they have no reason to need that data at the time. Stay vigilant!",-199.86000000000013,0

The bet specified that a single bitcoin would be worth at least USD 50,000 by the end of 2018, and there is USD 1 million at stake. The bet would have given the manager the chance to buy 275 bitcoins at USD 50,000 apiece any time before this Friday, when the call options expire, a purchase that would have cost USD 13.8 million. The manager spent just under USD 1 million on those call options. Bitcoin is trading at around USD 3,800 as of the time of writing, a drop of more than 80% from its peak of USD 19,783, when BlockTower made its bet. Back in 2017, in an interview with CNBC, Paul explained that the option contracts BlockTower has purchased expire if the price of Bitcoin fails to reach the prophesied price by the end of 2018. But if it does, it pays out the firm on a 30 to 1 odds. Hence, this USD 1 million bet would generate BlockTower a USD 29 million in profit. At the time, he added, “Bitcoin is volatile. This is a hyper volatile asset. Bitcoin is up more than 1,400% this year. It also falls 30% almost every other month. These calls are a bet that if its volatile to the upside we can easily see over USD 50,000 next year.” ___",-199.86000000000013,0

BTC/USD tested the USD 3,600 - USD 3,620 support area and later started trading in a range. The price is currently consolidating and likely preparing for the next break either above USD 3,850 or below USD 3,620. Similarly, ethereum price declined and tested the USD 125 support, which is acting as a crucial hurdle for sellers. Ripple price is following a declining path and it has trimmed most of its gains from the USD 0.450 resistance. It seems like the market is basing for the next move in the coming sessions.  Total market capitalization  During the past few hours (UTC 06:30 AM), bitcoin price  mostly traded in a range above the USD 3,620 support. BTC/USD could start a decent upward move if there is a proper break above the USD 3,800 and USD 3,850 resistance levels. Above this last, the price will most likely climb above the USD 3,900 and USD 3,950 resistance levels.
On the downside, the main support is near the USD 3,620 level, below which the price may well decline sharply below the USD 3,600 level. If there are more losses, the price could decline towards the USD 3,450 and USD 3,320 support levels. Ethereum price  struggled to move past the USD 130 - USD 135 resistance zone. ETH/USD must settle above USD 135 (hourly close) to initiate a fresh upward move towards the USD 140 and USD 145 resistance levels.
On the flip side, if there is a downside break below the USD 125 support, there is a risk of more losses below the USD 120 support. The next major support awaits at USD 112 where buyers are likely to emerge. Bitcoin cash price  failed to clear the USD 180 and USD 185 resistance levels. BCH/USD declined more than 5% and tested the USD 165 support area. If there is a downside break below USD 160, there could be a test of USD 150. Bitcoin SV is slowly moving higher, but there is a strong resistance near the USD 94, USD 96 and USD 98 levels. 
Ripple price  moved below the USD 0.380 support, which is a bearish sign. XRP/USD must trade above USD 0.375 and USD 0.382 to start a decent recovery in the near term. Recently, there was an increase in selling pressure on small cap altcoins, resulting in declines in DEX, POLY, STRAT, ONT, PIVX, MGO and IOST. Out of these, DEX declined more than 20% and POLY was down around 12%. To sum up, bitcoin price is reaching crucial juncture near the USD 3,620 level. If BTC/USD fails to move past the USD 3,850 resistance, there could be a sharp decline towards the USD 3,320 level in the near term. Likewise, ethereum price must trade above USD 135 to avoid further declines in the near term.

That’s what a community called “HODLers of Last Resort” does the upcoming January 3rd: participate in a Proof of Keys celebration by demanding and taking possession of all bitcoins held by trusted third parties on their behalf.  This practice, considered a test of trust by the community, is said to prove possession and strengthen network consensus.  “You can consider Proof of Keys a combat readiness drill. Hopefully, it will help prevent further annoying skirmishes with those who despise individuals empowered with monetary sovereignty,” the official website explains.  The movement is a chance for users to reassert possession over their own holdings, as well as to force third parties to prove that they actually hold all the assets they claim. According to Trace Mayer, host of the Bitcoin knowledge podcast and one of the main advocates for Proof of Keys, the event is designed to be a “celebration.” “The idea of Proof of Keys is to show to the [crypto] community that there is still control of our funds,” Mayer said in a video announcement. “Lots of new people have come into the community… I think it’s important for us to declare and redeclare our monetary sovereignty on a regular basis”. Private keys are, in short, a secret string of letters and numbers used to authorize transactions, signifying actual ownership of digital assets. Despite this, many crypto owners aren’t actually in possession of their private keys, relying instead on third-party entities like exchanges or custodial services to safeguard their holdings. This may seem like a non-issue - after all, banks work the same way - but the ideals behind Bitcoin, as well as legitimate safety concerns, warrant a check up at least out of principle.  The movement has garnered a lot of support. Over the past few weeks, many prominent figures in the crypto community, such as cryptography expert Nick Szabo, have added [Jan/3 [key emoji]] to their Twitter handles to show support for the operation. The mantra behind it - “Not your keys; not your bitcoin” - was initially coined by Andreas Antonopoulos, famous Bitcoin evangelist. The choice of date is no coincidence either: on January 3rd, 2009, Bitcoin’s Genesis block (first block of the blockchain) went live. The concept for the event originated from Reddit user “sotashi,” whom Mayer credited on his new website. Mayer has invited anyone interested in participating in the Proof of Keys event to tweet or retweet his message and fill out a form on the Proof of Keys website with links to their tweets. As of the time of writing, 246 people have filled out the form, including crypto personalities such as Keiser Report co-host Stacy Herbert and Adamant Capital founder Tuur Demeester. However, not everyone is supporting the initiative: ""do banks support people emptying their bank account""?? by withdrawing your coins from exchanges you're taking away their liquidity and power to manipulate the market. never store your coins on any exchange be your own bank with a hardware wallet like @LedgerHQ ,@Trezor etc. This event will also be “The ultimate stress test,” Mayer added, given that the movement of participants’ coins would result in a large number of transactions on that day. Noting that “Companies and exchanges must prove their trustworthiness and consensus,” he adds: “This simple exercise costs little, perhaps a few transaction fees, yet proves possession and strengthens network consensus [...] Then on the 4th of January there can be a return to business as usual with renewed confidence based on Proof of Keys.” Reddit user u/Porriz explains the significance of this: “Crypto is meant to be owned by yourself, safeguarded by yourself, stored by yourself. Every time you ‘buy’ coins in exchange and leave it there, you really don’t own any of those. Best services are services that lets you buy to any btc address you provide, eg. straight to your hardware wallet. The point is, that you do not have the coins unless you have private keys to yourself. You can achieve this by installing a software wallet on your phone/computer, generating paper wallet or buying a hardware wallet and moving the funds to those wallets. That is the only way to ensure you have the coins if eg. exchanges goes bankrupt, scams happen in exchanges, or anything similar happens.” u/FixedGearJunkie adds, “Really you're pulling it from the bank's pocket and putting it in your pocket. Theoretically it should have zero impact on the market as those coins have already been ‘bought.’ But if literally everyone that owned Bitcoin which was still on an exchange participates the outcome may be interesting and beneficial to the ecosystem.”",37.63000000000011,1

However, this silence of the institutional players might be illusory.  Joseph Lubin, co-founder of the Ethereum platform and founder of blockchain software technology company ConsenSys, recently tweeted: I am calling the cryptobottom of 2018. This bottom is marked by an epic amount of fear, uncertainty, and doubt from our friends in the 4th and crypto-5th estates. In a series of tweets, he goes on to explain that the recent news of ConsenSys 2.0 cutting its staff brought on an “epic amount of conjecture and preemptive paranoia,” but that the company is still going strong. In conclusion, he adds, “Peaking [sic] into 2019, if you could see the landscape through my eyes, you'd have to wear shades.” Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the CEO of largest cryptocurrency exchange by 24 hour trading volume with fees, Binance, was also equally optimistic in a recent interview: “I think that people in the industry are still very confident about the future.” The crypto community may be optimistic, but the traditionalists seem wary. According to people familiar with the matter, banking giant Goldman Sachs has made little to none progress in their crypto projects, having signed up only 20 clients, Bloomberg reported. Daniel H. Gallancy, chief executive officer of New York-based SolidX Partners, a company looking to launch Bitcoin ETFs in the US, told the news outlet: “The market had unrealistic expectations that Goldman or any of its peers could suddenly start a Bitcoin trading business. That was top-of-the-market-hype thinking.” Also, other undisclosed sources familiar with the matter, state that yet another giant, Morgan Stanley, has been technically prepared to offer swaps tracking Bitcoin futures since at least September, yet thus far has not traded a single contract. There had also been rumors about British bank Barclays exploring the possibilities of crypto integration, but a spokesman told Bloomberg that the bank currently has no plans for a crypto trading desk.  However, crypto pros see signs institutions are getting ready to jump back in if they need to. “The more important story is all the infrastructure that’s being built now to enable institutional trading,” Ben Sebley, a former Credit Suisse Group AG trader who is now head of brokerage at crypto boutique NKB Group, told Bloomberg. While Eugene Ng, a former Deutsche Bank AG trader in Singapore who has set up crypto hedge fund Circuit Capital, added that ""It appears as if progress is coming to a halt, yet nothing could be further from the truth."" ""The bear market is going to allow many of these institutions to build the proper foundations without rushing to build-out infrastructure without adequate testing for fear of missing out on a gold rush,"" Ng said. Moreover, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, is likely to launch its Bitcoin futures trading and custody platform Bakkt in January, despite a possible delay by a few days. Bakkt has long been regarded as a big step of traditional investors into crypto that could boost the adoption of Bitcoin.

For example, for the first time, teenagers said they wanted cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and Fortnite “V-Bucks” virtual currency instead of cash, gift cards and gas money, according to the “Holiday 2018” consumer report released in November by investment bank and asset management firm Piper Jaffray. The popularity of cryptocurrencies on the internet, from social media to online games, is drawing people to the nascent industry. From a way towards financial independence and autonomy to a lesson in investing, cryptocurrencies as a gift are attracting many fresh faces. Especially, when the young generation spends more time in front of computers and lives an increasingly digital life. In different online games, more and more so-called virtual currencies are used to buy and sell items in the game. For many, in-game currencies like V-Bucks, from the wildly popular, online third-person shooter game Fortnite that is used to purchase outfits, “skins” and “Battle Passes” but holds no value outside of the game, are the first contact they have with virtual currencies. In some respects, cryptocurrencies are similar to the virtual money you find in a video game. You buy them with fiat currency, they have no tangible form, and you can use them to buy the goods and services you desire. Another indication of this trend are Twitter polls. Although Twitter’s algorithm does not let people see who voted for what, thus preventing any insight into potential trends such as the age of respondents, their area of origin etc., it can be reasonably assumed that most voters are relatively young, as they tend to be more tech-savvy than their elders - thus more likely to use Twitter in the first place.  Two of these come from the Bank of England and former Texas Congressman Ron Paul and show that digital currencies are vastly preferred to other options.  The Bank of England does not specify what “digital currencies” they mean in their question “If you receive money as a gift at Christmas, what’s your favourite way to get it?” but this option took 71% of the votes, whereas 20% of respondents voted for cash, 7% for bank transfer, and only 2% for gift vouchers. ___ A Twitter user reacted:  You just can't say #bitcoin .. can you?Let me help.B - I - T - C - O - I - NB - I - T - C - O - I - NB - I - T - C - O - I - NB - I - T - C - O - I - NB - I - T - C - O - I - NB - I - T - C - O - I - NB - I - T - C - O - I - NB - I - T - C - O - I - N Ron Paul, meanwhile, does not beat around the bush with his wording: the question is, “A wealthy person gifts you USD 10,000. You get to choose in which form you’ll accept the gift. But there’s a catch: You must keep the gift in the form that you choose for 10 years without touching it. In which form would you accept the gift?” The options are Bitcoin (50% of votes), gold (37%), US 10-year Treasury Bonds (11%) and Federal Reserve Notes (2%). ____ If you’re still wondering what to buy your friends for Christmas, check out our list of ideas.

Will it continue to see price crashes? Or will the current recovery continue? Better yet, has the industry had a good year and will it continue to have significance in the new year? Earlier in the week, we heard from bears, like Erik Finman who called Bitcoin “dead;” and we heard from Spencer Bogart, a Bitcoin bull, who not only said BTC will continue to rise, but that 2018, contrary to popular belief, has been one of the best years for the cryptocurrency.  Today, word surfaced that the President of Coinbase, Asiff Hirji, believes something similar to Bogart. Despite the crashes experienced in 2018 (such as the bearish run that sent the Bitcoin price to a low of $3,200), Asiff Hirji believes BTC is recovering.  In his interview with CNBC’s Fast Money, Hirji said this recovery isn’t surprising and that it’s likely to continue into 2019. That’s a statement in complete opposition of the thoughts of Erik Finman. “Some things are never as good as they seem,” said the Coinbase President, “and never as bad as they seem.” Bitcoin soaring this week as the markets selloff.

According to Hirji, there’s been more innovation this year in the market. “We’ve never had as much innovation as we have today,” Hirji explained, citing, for instance, how cryptocurrencies are getting more visible. >> Facebook Cryptocurrency: Is the Tech Giant Developing a Stablecoin? Spencer Bogart, also during a Fast Money interview, spoke on something similar, calling 2018 a “fantastic year” for BTC, despite the Bitcoin price crashes. Speaking also on innovation, Bogart said this year is the first time we have scaled the digital currency “with a lightening network,” making transactions quick and cheap. At the time of writing, the BTC price is $3,905.13. It’s vital to take comments such as Asiff Hirji’s into consideration. While it’s easy to oust BTC from your mind due to the recent Bitcoin price crashes, we must also recognize the good that occurred during the year, such as an increase in innovation. What do you think? Let us know in the comments below. Featured Image: Depositphotos/Piter2121",-237.15999999999985,0

In a note to clients, dated December 13th, Lee wrote, “We are tired of people asking us about target prices [...] Because of the inherent volatility in crypto, we will cease to provide any timeframes for the realization of fair value,” Bloomberg reported. His decision to opt out of the forecast game may not come as a surprise, as his predictions were notable for being highly optimistic, as well as falling very far off the mark this year. He started out by saying that Bitcoin could climb back to USD 20,000 by mid-year and even reach USD 25,000 by the end of December. He later amended this end-of-the-year forecast, pulling it down to a USD 22,000 - USD 20,000 range. Then in November, when Bitcoin was trading at around USD 5,500, Lee was certain the price would triple in the remaining month and a half. As it is now, we are ten days out from 2019, and the price is stubbornly refusing to follow these forecasts, currently trading at around USD 4,000 - still more than what we have seen throughout most of December. Lee wasn’t discouraged then either, instead saying that the market is wrong and that Bitcoin’s true value lies between USD 13,800 and USD 14,800, given the number of active wallet addresses, usage per account and factors influencing supply. This was yet another of his statements that was met with ridicule, and would prove to be the last prediction he gave before quitting the issue altogether. Bitcoin price chart: Tom Lee is hardly the only one whose predictions fell short. Many were hoping for an end of the year bull run similar to what happened in December 2017, when many cryptocurrencies reached their all-time highs, and Bitcoin itself climbed to almost USD 20,000. To the contrary, 2018 has disappointed many, but the internet does not forget and so many of the forecasts by other notable names in the industry still stand. For example, in May, Arthur Hayes of BitMEX estimated that Bitcoin will be worth USD 50,000 by 2018 year end, however, in November he was already talking about a USD 2,000 - USD 3,000 range. In November 2017, Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital forecasted that Bitcoin might reach USD 40,000 in 2018. In November this year he estimated that the price will stand in a USD 3,000 - USD 6,000 range ""until institutional investors step in."" Meanwhile, software tycoon John McAfee still stands by his prediction that Bitcoin will reach USD 1 million by the end of 2020, which is best known by the fact that McAfee promised to eat his own genitalia on national TV if that should not happen. Other, less attention-grabbing predictions include investor Tim Draper, who was “told by spirits” that Bitcoin would reach USD 250,000 by 2022; Anthony Pompliano, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, a digital asset management firm, who saw BTC rising to USD 50,000 by the end of this year; and Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of digital-asset investment firm BKCM LLC, who agrees with Draper on the USD 250k by 2022 forecast.",-237.15999999999985,0

BTC/USD did gain bullish momentum and broke the USD 3,900 and USD 3,950 resistance levels. Buyers were even successful in breaking the USD 4,000 barrier. Similarly, ethereum and ripple extended upsides and traded above the USD 110 and USD 0.375 resistance respectively. The best performers were bitcoin cash and bitcoin SV since both gained more than 40%. The market sentiment is clearly positive (UTC 08:20 AM) and it seems like bitcoin buyers outclassed sellers. Total market capitalization  After a minor downside correction, bitcoin price  started a fresh upward move. BTC/USD broke the USD 3,900 and USD 3,950 resistance levels and later surpassed the USD 4,000 hurdle. The price is currently up more than 5% and it is facing resistance near the USD 4,100 level.
If there is a break above the USD 4,100 and USD 4,200 levels, the price is likely to accelerate towards the USD 4,550 resistance. On the downside, an immediate support is at USD 3,950, below which the price may test the USD 3,820 level. Ethereum price  rallied above the USD 110 resistance. ETH/USD tested the USD 118 level and later corrected lower.
However, declines were limited and the price bounced back above USD 112. It is currently up more than 10% and it seems like buyers could make an attempt to clear the USD 118 and USD 120 resistance levels. The key support are USD 110 and USD 108. Bitcoin cash price  remained the best performing cryptocurrency among the top 10. BCH/USD rallied more than 50% and broke the USD 200 and USD 210 resistance levels. The next stop for buyers could be USD 225 followed by USD 235. Bitcoin SV also gained traction and climbed above the USD 110 and USD 120 resistance levels. It is currently trading near USD 128 with a bullish angle.
Ripple price  did not gain much and trimmed around 2% gains. XRP/USD retreated from the USD 0.380 resistance and it is currently trading near the USD 0.360 support. A break above USD 0.370 and USD 0.380 is needed for a solid upward move. The past few sessions were very bullish and many small cap altcoins gained more than 15%, including CRO, BCD, BTG, AION, DASH, ADA, MIOTA, AE, PIVX and TRX. Out of these, CRO rallied more than 30% and bitcoin diamond is up around 26%. Overall, bitcoin is trading nicely above the USD 3,900 and USD 3,800 support levels. Therefore, there are high possibilities of more gains above the USD 4,080 and USD 4,100 levels in the near term. If BTC/USD continues to gain bullish momentum, altcoins such as ethereum, bitcoin cash, bitcoin SV, ripple, litecoin, neo and others are also likely to climb further higher.

The bipartisan bill is named the Token Taxonomy Act, and was put forward by Republican congressman Warren Davidson and Darren Soto of the Democrats. The draft law proposes making key changes to the Securities Act (1933) and the Securities Exchange Act (1934). It would specifically exclude cryptocurrencies, instead creating a clear legal definition of “digital tokens,” which would be excluded from the two acts, and thus would no longer automatically be regarded as securities. Today is the last day of Congress’ current session, meaning there is little real chance that the bill will be passed before the year is out. However, the draft law’s authors appear keen to table it again once Congress reconvenes in 2019. A number of America’s most prominent blockchain and cryptocurrency businesspeople have been calling for legal clarification. Davidson is a known blockchain proponent, and chaired a meeting of around 50 major financial and cryptocurrency-related companies in September this year. The regulatory Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) currently makes use of the “Howey Test,” an evaluation assessment created by the Supreme Court back in 1946. The test allows courts to determine whether certain transactions should qualify as ""investment contracts.” Courts have been using this test to assess whether cryptocurrencies can be considered as securities – despite complaints from critics, who call the test an ineffective way to assess digital, blockchain-powered tokens. CNBC quotes Kristin Smith, the head of the Blockchain Association, the “first Washington blockchain lobby group,” as saying, “Decentralized networks don’t fit neatly within the existing regulatory structure. [The bill] is a step forward in finding the right way to regulate them. It shows that there’s momentum on both sides. There's interest among bipartisan members.” Smith is also quoted as saying that the bill “lays groundwork for the next Congress"" – which will open with a Democrat majority next year. Smith also states that, if the bill receives Congress’ approval, cryptocurrencies will “likely fall under the purview of the Federal Trade Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC),” rather than remain under the control of the SEC. The SEC has previously stated that it considers all initial coin offerings (ICOs) as securities, with the specific exceptions of Bitcoin and Ethereum, both of which are considered “commodities,” and are now regulated by the CFTC. As reported by Cryptonews.com, governments will likely focus on two cryptocurrency-related regulation areas in 2019: taxation and regulation surrounding offerings/marketing to the public. Having seen that cryptocurrencies are becoming more safely policed, the general public may become more willing to use and adopt them.",-237.15999999999985,0

With a price increase of more than 8% in the past 24 hours as of the time of writing (UTC 10:20 AM), many in the crypto community breathe a sigh of relief. Bitcoin price chart: It may be too early to celebrate, however.  “The market is extremely oversold by most metrics - near the most oversold in Bitcoin’s history,” Mike McGlone, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst in New York said on Wednesday. According to McGlone, Bitcoin will form a new floor in 2019, which will be even lower than current prices in spite of the coin’s relative-strength index and its “extreme discount” to most moving averages. In either case, the fundamentals of Bitcoin and Ethereum networks have not fallen as much as prices have, author of the popular book Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond, Chris Burniske, said in December. Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, a social trading and investment platform, thinks short covering, or the buying in of assets that have been sold short (typically to avoid loss when prices move upwards) is the only reason for the green market.  “Especially after the short squeeze, we saw on Monday, today's action is simply a continuation of that. Markets are made of people and it's likely that most people will be looking to reduce their exposure before the holidays. Over the last few weeks, there have been a lot of high leveraged short positions building up and when those sell positions are closed, it creates upward pressure on market prices."" According to Greenspan, the evidence of this can be found hiding in plain sight as Bitcoin Cash is up by more than 40% in the past 24 hours and represents proof of this reason for market movements.  “Take a look at how Bitcoin Cash, which has probably been the most controversial of coins and many have blamed for the recent slide, is up about double of what the rest of the market has done today,” Greenspan adds. Meanwhile, on Wednesday evening, a popular crypto trader, known on Twitter as Blackbeard, asked his 33,000 followers to share their bitcoin price prediction for the end of this year. Out of almost 200 replies the majority estimated that bitcoin will close 2018 in a range of around USD 3,000 - USD 4,000.  Other cryptocurrencies are also in green: XRP has gained around 5%, ETH is close to 7% and the others follow similar upward slopes, while Bitcoin Cash is the clear winner with a 40% increase. In the top 50 coins by market cap, the only “loser” is Maker with -1%. Bitcoin’s market capitalization also hit a two-week high of USD 70 billion, while the price itself had not been seen above USD 4,000 since December 4th.  ____

BTC/USD even traded above USD 3,900 and later corrected lower. However, downsides were limited and the price bounced back above USD 3,750. Similarly, ethereum extended gains towards USD 110 and later corrected lower. The USD 100 zone acted as a support and the price is still trading in a bullish zone. Bitcoin cash performed well recently and it broke the USD 130 and USD 140 resistance levels. The overall market sentiment is still positive (UTC 08:00 AM,) suggesting more gains in the near term.  Total market capitalization  There was a solid bullish extension above the USD 3,750 and USD 3,820 resistance levels in bitcoin price . BTC/USD broke the USD 3,900 barrier and later corrected lower. However, the previous resistance at USD 3,650 - USD 3,700 acted as a support and prevented further declines.
The price bounced back and traded above the USD 3,750 and USD 3,800 resistance levels. It is currently up around 3%, with an immediate resistance at USD 3,850. If buyers remain in action, the price is likely to clear the USD 3,900 and USD 3,950 resistance levels in the coming sessions. Ethereum price  traded close to the USD 108 - USD 110 resistance and later corrected lower. ETH/USD corrected below the USD 105 level, but the USD 100 support acted as a solid buy zone.
The price bounced back and it is currently up close to 3%. The first resistance for buyers is near the USD 105 level, above which the price may trade to a new weekly high, probably above USD 110. Bitcoin cash price  remained in a solid uptrend above the USD 120 resistance. BCH/USD gained more than 25% and it recently broke the USD 135 and USD 140 resistance levels. The next challenge for buyers is near the USD 148 - USD 150 zone. BCHSV also started a nice upward move and moved up by around 8%. It is currently trading near USD 90 and it may perhaps test the USD 95 or USD 100 resistance level.
Ripple price  climbed above the USD 0.380 resistance, but it faced a lot of offers near the USD 0.390 resistance. XRP/USD may continue to rise and it is likely to revisit the USD 0.380 or USD 0.390 resistance. Many small cap altcoins rallied recently by more than 10%, including STRAT, LINK, WAVES, PAY, AION and BCN. Out of these, STRAT performed really well and extended gains above the USD 1.40 resistance. Similarly, LINK broke the USD 0.30 resistance and gained close to 25%. To sum up, the market sentiment is pointing more gains in bitcoin above the USD 3,800 level. There are even chances of an upside acceleration above the USD 4,000 resistance in the near term (Update: bitcoin increased above USD 4,000 later today.) Similarly, ethereum could break the USD 110 resistance and ripple price may test the USD 0.400 resistance.

And there’s nothing to say it definitely won’t; in the last three days, Bitcoin has packed on 18% in gains. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap jumped from $3,181 to $3,776 in under three days, proving further that nobody can truly know where this coin is headed next. One advocate for its future upturn is Mike Kayamori, CEO of Quinone, a Japan-based crypto exchange platform. Speaking with Bloomberg TV, Kayamori believes that by the end of 2019, Bitcoin won’t just have increased its price, but it will hit a new all-time high. Is he just being hopeful or is there anything to back this up? The future can always appear promising, but 2018 has been anything but for Bitcoin. The crypto market has been truly bearish all year, wiping 80% of its value off the board since January. Bitcoin was priced at around $20,000 this time last year; now it is struggling to stay above $3,000. There have been some brief bullish runs here and there, but overall, Bitcoin has been on a steady downward spiral for most of the year. It doesn’t help that it’s taken most altcoins with it. >> Spencer Bogart: Bitcoin Price Can Go Lower or Higher, Either Way It’s a Good Asset But for Kayamori, the reason for the current state of Bitcoin is simply a lack of newness in the crypto market. Believing that “there’s nothing new, no catalyst” to propel the market forward, he could be right. Cryptocurrencies grew their value from hype, after all, and there has been very little newness to continue the momentum. But what is new in Kayamori’s opinion is that Japanese exchanges are adapting to Japan’s regulations and the country is open to more industry players. This, he thinks, will help to spur on adoption, at least in Japan anyway. The CEO also went on to say that the arrival of Fidelity Digital Asset Services by Bakkt, as well as other investor-focused products in early 2019, will give “new momentum and sentiment” and could drive a bullish Bitcoin rebound.

As the competition among Bitcoin miners was dropping for more than a month, mining itself has become easier and the market bounced back this week, it encouraged some miners to strengthen their focus on the Bitcoin mining again.   The average hash rate, or computing power, of the Bitcoin network, that was decreasing for more than a month, started to picking up on December 14, or even before the price jump on Monday. Moreover, yesterday, the Bitcoin mining difficulty dropped less than estimated, or by 9.56%. BTC.com, a major mining pool, forecasted a 16% drop. However, now, the pool estimates that the difficulty will drop by another 8.22% in almost 13 days. Bitcoin hash rate: _____  The mining difficulty of Bitcoin is adjusted every two weeks (every 2016 blocks, to be precise) to maintain the normal 10-minute block time. This means that if there are many miners competing amongst themselves and propagating blocks in less than ten minutes, the difficulty of the next puzzle will be increased; if there are few miners and it takes them much longer to find a solution, the difficulty is decreased - both times just enough to keep block times at around 10 minutes. In this case, the previous average block time was close to 12 minutes, so the difficulty dropped on December 18th at around UTC 23.30, to bring block time closer to 10 minutes (still, it's around 11 minutes now). However, not everyone can take advantage of this situation. As reported, only a select few can afford to stay in the game: miners with scale, very specific business models and extremely low electricity costs. At the same time, many other miners are under growing pressure as the bitcoin price dropped by 80% since its all-time high in December of 2017. According to previous reports, between 600,000 and 800,000 Bitcoin miners have pulled the plug on their operations in the second half of November. Earlier in December, market analysis firm Autonomous Research estimated that at least 100,000 individual miners have shut down, and advisory firm Fundstrat Global Advisors added that since early September, about 1.4 million servers have been unplugged.

The investment from Draper and his Draper Associates, a seed-stage venture capital firm, totaled USD 1.25 million, according to multiple media reports. “With their backing, we plan to scale the team, build our network, and ultimately, push for hyperbitcoinization [Bitcoin-induced currency demonetization],” the startup added. OpenNode is a bitcoin-only payment processor that aims to enable all kinds of businesses to accept bitcoin payments for everyday items like coffee and groceries via the Lightning Network. The firm has recently launched its re-designed platform to the public, and is right now running a promotion where the platform will be free to use for the first 30 days. After that, the fee for using the payments processor will be 1% of transactions. Over the years, Draper’s company Draper Associates has invested in numerous crypto-related companies, including hardware wallet maker Ledger, fiat-to-crypto exchange Coinbase, and cross-border business transaction service BitPesa, to name a few. Tim Draper has made a name for himself in the crypto community with his highly optimistic bitcoin price predictions. Back in April of this year, he famously predicted that bitcoin would reach USD 250,000 within four years, joking that the “spirits told me.” Although some may think Draper was overly optimistic about bitcoin’s prospects, the investor does have a good track record with his forecasts: In 2014, he correctly predicted that bitcoin would pass USD 10,000 mark in 2017. It appears like Tim Draper is not the only famous billionaire who is still bullish on bitcoin. On Tuesday, former Wall Street banker and current Bitcoin bull Michael Novogratz said during a Bloomberg interview that he expects bitcoin to trade between USD 3,000 and USD 6,000 in the near future, while adding that “hopefully next year we’ll start seeing it move up.” Watch the interview below:",39.129999999999654,1

Some are bearish, using the fact that BTC was nearing $20 thousand this time last year. Others, however, continue to be bullish. Spencer Bogart of Bitcoin Capital is one of the latter. In a recent interview with CNBC, when asked whether he believes BTC will hit $50,000, Spencer Bogart said yes, but maybe not as soon as bulls are forecasting.  “Absolutely it can go that high,” said Bogart, “how long will it take, I’m not sure.” That’s a different but realistic approach to the future of Bitcoin price, compared to someone like Tom Lee, who reiterated his $15 thousand year-end prediction last month. The crypto market is aware of the downward tumble in the Bitcoin price. However, players remain divided as to what the cause of it was. Was it because Bitcoin was never meant to succeed? Just another Ponzi scheme? Bears may agree. Or, was it because of the individual players buying the digital currency, not being mature enough to learn the ropes before climbing up them? For Spencer Bogart, co-founder of Bitcoin Capital, he is of no opinion. He is simply ignoring the BTC price. Bogart said that if you ignore it, it becomes evident that 2018 has been a “fantastic year” for the digital currency. “This is the first year we have started to move to scale Bitcoin with a lightening network where you can transact extremely quickly and extremely cheaply,” explained Bogart. >> Has Tether Told the Truth All Along? Bank Statements Say 1 For 1 In the CNBC interview, Bogart said: “I think it’s a great buy in opportunity right now.” Does he deny that Bitcoin will probably drop lower? No; “Could we go lower?” Bogart asked, “absolutely.” But that’s what makes it such a great opportunity. “I think anywhere between here and $2,000 and $1,000 is a great buy in opportunity.”  He added that in 24 months, people may look back and say “why didn’t I buy now?” The interviewer didn’t seem to support the idea as much, jokingly responding back saying “I hope so. I hope it’s not more of a question of why did I buy then?” Some people are worried about the Bitcoin price lingering around $3,000, but Spencer Bogart is not one of them.

However, Western Union Global Money Transfer President Odilon Almeida doesn’t think the industry is there yet. In a video published by WU, Almeida considers the company is in the perfect position to benefit from the cryptocurrency movement in the long-term compared to any startup, given that they have “deep knowledge” about international money transfer, as well as millions of users. “Cryptocurrency might become one more option for a way for assets to be exchanged between people and countries. If that happens we would be ready to launch,” he said. He also explains that cryptocurrencies have so far failed to achieve mass adoption because they have yet to master three things: governance, compliance and volatility. However, in his opinion, WU is already better equipped to solve for such variables because it already moves money across 130 currencies and “devotes substantial resources to all of those three challenges.” Blockchain technology, however, does not run into those problems. Almeida makes a distinction between blockchain and cryptocurrencies, saying that the former “has a lot of potential,” adding that, “you’re gonna see more and more ways of using the technology going forward.” The company claims that, “There are many potential applications for the financial services sector, and WU is investing in finding those that best meet our platform,” further clarifying that WU has partnered with Ripple Labs to test whether sending payments by blockchain was faster and less expensive, but that “the tests are ongoing.” “Whenever I’m asked if Western Union will introduce a digital currency, I like to say that we have already done it decades ago,” Almeida said, referring to Western Union’s ability to transfer money digitally. “Western Union is ready today to adopt any kind of currency. We already operate with 130 currencies. If we, one day, feel like it’s the right strategy to introduce cryptocurrencies to our platform, technology-wise, it’s just one more currency.” His opinion resonates with the company’s earlier stance. Back in June, the company’s CEO Hikmet Ersek said WU won't be joining the crypto craze until these currencies become more widely used. As for the supposedly ongoing tests with Ripple Labs, WU has then stated that they had not seen a benefit from Ripple’s technology during a six-month trial period. In the third quarter, WU generated revenue of USD 1.4 billion, which declined 1% compared to the prior year, or increased 3% on a constant currency basis. Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) revenues, which represented 80% of total company revenue in the quarter, were flat on a reported basis, or increased 2% constant currency, while transactions grew 4%.

Now, a new application programming interface (API) lets users send encrypted messages to each other from some of the remotest regions on Earth and pay for those message in bitcoin using the Lightning Network service. The company’s chief strategy officer, Samson Mow, told Forbes, “Bitcoin has always been about uncensorable money, and now we have uncensorable communications as well.”  Blockstream Satellite coverage: Meanwhile, CEO Adam Back added that he expects the new satellite and API to lead to increased development of smartphone and feature phone applications that link together Blockstream’s GreenAddress bitcoin wallet, its Liquid Network for enabling faster transactions between exchanges, and its Cryptocurrency Data Feed for real-time and historical bitcoin exchange data, developed in partnership with the New York Stock Exchange parent company.  Because the entire Bitcoin blockchain will be broadcast, even miners will be able to use the satellite connection for mining: “You could set up a bitcoin mining operation in the middle of the desert powered by solar,”  said Back. “While satellite communications are traditionally cost-prohibitive, Blockstream Satellite will finally allow developers to adopt satellite communications in their applications [...] Natural disaster notifications, secure personal messaging, and sending bitcoin market data to remote locations are just some of the exciting examples of the power of this service,” Chris Cook, head of the Blockstream Satellite project, was quoted as saying in the official announcement by the company. Meanwhile, some members of the cryptoverse just found a way how to use this new opportunity:  Instead of an angel or star on top my Christmas tree this year, I will put a satellite dish pointing to the Blockstream Satellite. Aesthetically pleasing no, practical yes.   However, one needs to build a receiver first, that might cost around USD 139, according to a Blockstream Satellite parts list published on Amazon. Also, on its Github page, the company explains how to set-up this satellite.  Using a peer-to-peer system both for sending funds and communicating, especially during natural disasters, has been the focus of many other projects as well. One of them is Proof of Life, made by a group of developers using a portable hard drive, a solar battery pack, a shortwave radio, and a lot of technical knowledge. This off-grid technology is not just meant to be used for sending cryptocurrencies - it also guarantees the ability to send immutable information all over the world without relying on the grid. For example, victims of disasters could communicate with the outside world, making rescue operations and getting help much more efficient.",151.29999999999973,1
2018-12-18,3544.76,3701.35,3487.17,3696.06,5911325473.0,64422587801.0," Despite the year-long bear market in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the 1-year anniversary of Bitcoin’s all-time high was marked by a significant bounce in prices across all major cryptocurrencies. Over the past 24 hours (UTC 07:07 AM), bitcoin was up nearly 8%, while XRP and Ethereum traded up by roughly 16% and 9%, respectively. Strongest among the top 100 digital assets, however, was EOS, which added about a quarter of its price in just 24 hours. December 17, 2018 was the date we remember as the all-time high for the bitcoin price, nearly reaching the milestone USD 20,000 on most exchanges, while surpassing that number on some others. Today – one year later – bitcoin is trading around USD 3,500, after a decline of more than 80%. Top 10 coins today: (UTC 07:05 AM) According to a Bloomberg report on Monday, David Thomas, director and co-founder at crypto brokerage GlobalBlock suggested that major cryptocurrencies have become cheap, saying investors for the first time in a long while are now seeing “value in getting back into the [crypto] market,” and that this seems to be what is driving the market higher now. Meanwhile, Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, reminded that the massive slide in bitcoin value this year may seem unprecedented, ""but in fact, retracements of this magnitude have happened no less than four times in Bitcoin's short history."" ""Because cryptoassets are such a new concept, we are still finding ways to figure out what the value of them should be. All assets in every market go through price discovery, but due to the rapid growth of the crypto industry, this process of price discovery is currently on steroids,"" Greenspan added. CNBC also ran a story on Monday where they reviewed all of the bullish price predictions that were given to bitcoin at its all-time high a year ago. The show host then went on to ask Spencer Bogart, a blockchain venture capitalist, a partner at Blockchain Capital, about his earlier forecast, to which he simply replied that his company is a “long-term venture investor,” although he added that bitcoin “could absolutely” go to USD 50,000, given that bitcoin cannot be valued in the same way as a typical company. Bogart also added that “the fundamentals have not changed” and that “2018 has been a fantastic year for bitcoin” when you ignore the price, pointing to things like the Lightning Network being enabled on bitcoin, professional custody services entering the space, as well as the Yale and Harvard endowments making investments. “I think anywhere between here and 2,000 or 1,000 is just a fantastic buying opportunity. I think when we look back 24 months from now, even 12 months from now, we’re gonna say ‘why didn’t I buy then?’,” Bogard concluded the interview by saying. In a separate tweet Bogart said there are three sources of BTC demand in years ahead:
“1) Generational shift (teenagers want crypto more than cash & gift cards)
2) Central banks & institutions (demand for non-sovereign digital asset w/ absolute scarcity)
3) Programmable money (the opportunities of natively digital money = HUGE)”

The crypto boom was in its prime and BTC, in particular, saw a rise, especially in the second half of December. When this happened, there was a rush to buy the cryptocurrency; then there was a crash. One year later, the BTC price is nowhere near where it was in December 2017.  However, even though we have more Bitcoin bears emerging from the forest, there is some indication that BTC is the same asset and will continue to provide investors with the same shots. In December of 2017, Bitcoin price was flying and almost reached a whopping $20,000. Fast forward a year, things are looking a little different.  At the time of writing, the BTC price is sitting at $3,587.05. Despite the visible price changes in Bitcoin, the crypto market remains divided. There are bears, like Erik Finman, and there are bulls, like Tom Lee, who has maintained his end-of-year outlook, despite the falling market. This week, MarketWatch published an interview with Erik Finman, a teenage Bitcoin millionaire. Going from a 12-year-old who purchased Bitcoin with $1,000 from his grandmother, Finman is now bearish on the digital currency. >> EOS, Litecoin (LTC), and Cardano (ADA) Get a Boost! “Bitcoin is dead,” explained Finman in the interview. “It may have a bull market or two left in it, but long-term, it’s dead.” Not everyone feels this way, though.  Tom Lee, a long-standing crypto bull, announced back in November that he still believes the Bitcoin price will reach $15,000 by the end of 2018. Meanwhile, Matti Greenspan, an eToro senior analyst, thinks Bitcoin may make a comeback. Greenspan also believes the digital currency’s price fluctuations over the last year have no reflection on BTC’s long-term interest. Perhaps one of the most intriguing comments comes from Clement Thibault, an Investing.com senior analyst. Describing the Bitcoin bubble experienced in 2017, Thibault says it was the result of “human greed and short-term thinking.” Thibault adds that BTC hasn’t changed “and it remains the same asset, whether it’s $20,000 or $3,000.” Both the Bitcoin bulls and bears make valid points. Just like with other markets, however, only time will tell the direction that Bitcoin price takes in 2019. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© muratani",292.74000000000024,1

The brokerage was co-founded by Greg Tusar, former global head of electronic trading at Goldman Sachs Group, who is working alongside co-founders Jennifer Campbell (CEO), and Marc Bhargava, the company’s president. Tagomi claims it has raised USD 16 million from investors such as Peter Thiel’s (co-founder of PayPal) venture-capital firm, Founders Fund, Collaborative Fund, SV Angel, Digital Currency Group, and others.  The company bills itself as bringing “robust infrastructure and institutional services that sophisticated investors need to trade at scale.” They are not an exchange, however: the company works with digital asset trading venues, OTC desks, and others to execute trades across multiple liquidity venues, their website explains.  “Cryptocurrency trading lacks the transparency and sophisticated execution that top family offices and wealth management firms have come to expect,"" said one of the backers, Joe Lonsdale, Founder of Palantir and Addepar, two American software companies.  “Our focus is on providing our clients, which include financial institutions, high net worth individuals and other sophisticated digital asset investors, a comprehensive solution that eases the operational challenges associated with trading at scale in this emerging asset class.” Campbell was quoted as saying in a press release. Meanwhile, Tusar told Bloomberg that the current environment is challenging, ""but we think there’s a lot of longer-term demand for digital assets and helping clients understand the transformative impact of crypto and blockchain.” Tagomi’s investors generally have a long-term view when it comes to digital assets and cryptocurrencies, said Tusar, adding that the team began building the platform in March.  ""The people we’re engaging so far are still interested and engaged because they see what this technology can do over the long-term,"" Tusar said. The company’s website reiterates their belief that the platform is either for a “sophisticated investor or organization” or “an institution who demands a high level of regulatory compliance.” Investors who want to place orders of USD 10 million for Bitcoin, for example, might be limited if no exchange is able to handle the order. However, Tagomi only takes customers from certain jurisdictions in order to comply with laws and regulations, and requires all customers to go through their compliance on-boarding process.",292.74000000000024,1

BTC/USD even broke the USD 3,200 support area and tested the USD 3,150 support area. Later, the price recovered and it seems like there could be more upsides above USD 3,300 and USD 3,350 in the coming sessions. Similarly, ethereum price stayed above the USD 80 support and it is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) correcting higher towards the USD 90 and USD 95 resistance levels. Ripple price remained stable and it is currently facing a lot of hurdles near the USD 0.295 and USD 0.300 resistance levels. Total market capitalization  After forming a decent support near USD 3,150, bitcoin price  started an upward move. BTC/USD gained pace above the USD 3,200 level and it is currently trading above USD 3,250. If buyers remain in action, there are chances of more gains above the USD 3,300 and USD 3,350 resistance levels in the near term.
The main weekly resistances are at USD 3,400 and USD 3,500, above which bitcoin will most likely move into a bullish zone. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,200, below which the price could test the weekly support at USD 3,150. Ethereum price  retested the USD 80 support area recently where buyers emerged. ETH/USD is currently moving higher and it seems like it could even break the USD 88 and USD 90 resistances.
However, the key weekly resistance is near the USD 98 - USD 100 zone, which may continue to stop gains in the near term. If there is a successful close above USD 100, the price may move into a medium term bullish trend. Bitcoin cash  declined heavily this past week and broke the USD 100, USD 95 and USD 90 support levels. BCH/USD is currently trading near the USD 80 support, with resistance at USD 85 and USD 90. BCHSV also followed BCH and declined below the USD 80 support. It is currently recovering, but it won’t be easy for buyers to clear the USD 80 and USD 85 resistance levels.
Ripple price  is currently flat near the USD 0.285 support level. To start a solid upward move, XRP/USD must move above the USD 0.295 and USD 0.300 resistance levels. The key weekly support is at USD 0.280, below which there could be a sharp decline. During the past few hours, a few small cap altcoins gained traction and moved up by more than 10%, including R, FCT, ARB, MGO and MOAC. Out of these, revain (R) rallied more than 35% and factom (FCT) is up close to 28%. Overall, bitcoin price seems to be preparing for a short term rebound above USD 3,300. Having said that, BTC/USD must break the USD 3,400 and USD 3,500 resistance levels for a larger recovery in the near term. If there is no positive move above the USD 3,400 level, then bitcoin and altcoins like ethereum, ripple, litecoin, eos, neo and tron are likely to resume bearish moves.

The world’s largest coin by market cap is currently selling for $3,301.60 USD according to coinmarketcap.com. But earlier today, it fell to $3,200, representing a 15-month low for Bitcoin and not helping bulls’ hopes for a revival. This is the lowest level since September 2017. In the last four weeks alone, Bitcoin has dropped 49% in price. Surely, sellers are exhausted, and Bitcoin is set to turn around. Earlier this week, BTC began moving upwards towards $3,633, but it did not last. The coin’s failure to produce a worthy bounce back despite being extremely oversold indicates that the bears are winning this war and negative sentiment is strong. A 200-week moving average support of $3,170 has been established and now heading below it may be a real possibility for Bitcoin. Across the market, the sentiment is once again bearish. Bitcoin Cash’s recent forks Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin Cash are both two of the biggest losers, with declines of approximately 11% and 14% respectively. It seems the hashrate war between these two coins is doing neither of them any favors. The hard fork happened on November 15th, and the contentious split has caused both coins to lose more than they have gained. Elsewhere, Stellar is down 7.5%, and EOS is down 5%. Ethereum is down 4.5%. >> You Can Earn Bitcoin (BTC) While Shopping with the Lolli App What’s causing the market-wide sell-off? Notably, investors are worried over the fate of a Bitcoin ETF gaining US approval in February. Also the uncertainty of whether or not (or when) this bear sentiment will end, leaves investors’ prospects for short-term Bitcoin price gains at a paltry level. However, some are calling this period one of the “best buying opportunities.” At its current prices, rating agency Weiss is a firm believer that Bitcoin will turn around and now is the time to buy.

If you do, a new in-browser app has emerged and wants to give you Bitcoin (BTC). CoinDesk just reported that the app called Lolli just added Sephora to their list of retailers. Lolli gives shoppers cash back after they make purchases at their list of partnered retailers. The Bitcoin rewards startup told CoinDesk that it recently won over Sephora by data. Around 30 percent of Lolli’s active users are women. “We’ve gone back to a lot of these retailers that previously were not interested but now are coming on-board,” Lolli CEO Alex Adelman told CoinDesk. “One of the biggest ones that just joined us is Sephora, which adds an entire suite of retailers in the beauty category.” Lolli is also partnered with Sephora’s biggest competitor, Ulta. These retailers pay Lolli for customer referrals in fiat currency, which in turn is converted into Bitcoin for rewards in the app. Many crypto-based startup companies have faced vast layoffs this year, due to the bear market. However, Lolli has only six employees and is gaining some traction. >> Crypto Users Increased to 35 Million in 2018: What Will 2019 Bring?

Lolli is currently partnered with 500+ popular retailers. You can earn Bitcoin (BTC) through Lolli by shopping online with these major retailers: Barnes & Noble, Overstock, FinishLine, Michaels, Toms, Macy’s, Walmart, CVS Pharmacy, Lululemon, Groupon, and VRBO.

In a note on Thursday, he said that Bitcoin’s current price of USD 3,400 is wrong because its actual fair market value is between USD 13,800 and USD 14,800, given the number of active wallet addresses, usage per account and factors influencing supply. (The second part of the article updated with a commentary from Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro.) Although hisinitial prediction was for Bitcoin to reach USD 25,000 by the end of 2018, he amended that to a range of USD 20,000 - USD 22,000. When the market started getting more bearish, his prediction went down to around USD 15,000 as he stated the price would triple by the end of the year. Now, this divergence of more than four times the current price can be explained by last year’s meteoric rally, a “meltdown” in the macroeconomic climate and treasury sales during initial coin offerings, he believes. “Fair value is significantly higher than the current price of Bitcoin,” he wrote in his note, reported by Bloomberg, adding, “In fact, working backwards, to solve for the current price of Bitcoin, this implies crypto wallets should fall to 17 million from 50 million currently.”  As reported, Chris Burniske, author of the popular book on cryptoassets, and partner of venture firm Placeholder, also believes that the fundamentals of Bitcoin and Ethereum networks have not fallen as much as prices have. Moreover, the number of verified cryptoasset users climbed from 18 million to 35 million this year, almost doubling, all in the first three quarters of 2018.  Meanwhile, Lee claims that user adoption is the key to Bitcoin’s price boom: if Bitcoin wallets approach just 7 percent of Visa’s 4.5 billion account holders, fair value would be USD 150,000 per Bitcoin according to his model, he believes - and he refuses to update his forecast for the end of the year. The community is pretty divided in reaction to his forecast.  Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, reacted in a daily commentary:  ""In my personal philosophy, the market is never wrong. Fair value is what someone is willing to pay for it. I can understand how using metrics to try and determine what the price of an asset should be can be helpful. However, if nobody is willing to pay that amount, then it isn't the correct value."" According to him, ""Thomas even went as far as trying to reverse engineer his own calculations showing how given the current price of bitcoin, there should be far fewer active wallets. This thinking sounded a bit silly to me as well."" ""Sure, I believe that bitcoin can grow in value very quickly. After all, there is an extremely limited supply. But for that to happen demand needs to pick up first,"" Greenspan added. However, there are those that want to believe Lee: He's a super nice, interesting guy but he's dead wrong currently on both equities and bitcoin. While Reddit user u/lazyhippopotamus writes, “It's obvious. The market is definitely being manipulated heavily, and we're the ones losing money over it.” However, people in this club are few and far between, with many more taking to ridiculing the Bitcoin bull over all his forecasts. “Isn't the market always right and can't only people predicting it be wrong?” asks u/Frag1le, while u/SacrificesForMoloch writes, “The dude who has been wrong all year is saying the market is wrong... Yah OK. Don't listen to these charlatans.” The majority of the community on Twitter shares this opinion: user @Salt_Water_Croc says, “Even a noob who joined market yesterday can predict better and closer price to reality. What an idiot this #TomLee is.” Price predictions for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a dime a dozen, since pretty much everyone can make a prediction that might come true in such a volatile market. As data analyst Nick Maggiulli put it, “Where did all these people go wrong? When they made a Bitcoin price prediction in the first place. You CANNOT predict chaotic systems.” Meanwhile, New York-based research company Delphi Digital estimates that the price of Bitcoin may go up in 2019, after bottoming out in the first quarter of the year.",-69.26999999999998,0

Police forces across the United States say they have received multiple reports of emailed threats, with similar announcements made in New Zealand.

The actual volume of most of these pairs is under 1% of their reported volume, and only two of the top 25 BTC pairs, listed on Binance and Bitfinex, do not suffer from this. A wash trade is a form of market manipulation in which an investor simultaneously sells and buys the same financial instruments to create misleading, artificial activity in the marketplace. The report, done by the Blockchain Transparency Institute (BTI,) a group of blockchain data researchers and enthusiasts, claims that the biggest offender is the OKEx exchange, as the team claims that it found almost all of their top 30 traded tokens to be engaging in wash trading when processed through their algorithms.  However, even the estimated adjusted volume for them would still keep them in the top 10 exchanges. Some other mentioned exchanges are Huobi, HitBTC and Bithumb, the latter reportedly engaging in wash trading primarily with Monero, Dash, Bitcoin Gold, and ZCash and changing those pairs monthly. Top 25 BTC trading pairs on Coinmarketcap: This manipulation tactic is dangerous for any aspiring token projects, as they pay exorbitant fees to be listed on exchanges that they believe hold a large trading volume and might offer high liquidity. The report adds that the average project spent over USD 50,000 this year in listing fees in order to add their tokens on exchanges which practice wash trading, and this adds up to an estimated USD 100 million only in 2018. They add, “With over 50 exchanges wash trading over 95% of their volumes, this is a 500K a year scheme, with some exchanges making over one million dollars this year just from collecting these fees.” Top 25 BTC trading pairs by BTI: The fake trading volume issue is a long-standing one in the cryptocurrency world. Aside from wash trading, some exchanges engage in other manipulative behavior such as transaction mining, where they return a portion of the trading fees paid by users when they place orders on the exchange in the form of the exchange’s own token. In some extreme cases, users can receive tokens worth more than the trading fee they paid, essentially earning free money by generating buy and sell orders on the exchange. Users then follow up and often run trading algorithms designed to generate a large number of orders, inflating the trading volume on the exchange.

BTC/USD is struggling to rebound, which might result in a strong bearish reaction below USD 3,350 or USD 3,300 in the coming sessions. Similarly, ethereum price failed to surpass the USD 95 and USD 100 resistance levels on a couple of occasions. Ripple price is stuck just above USD 0.300 and below USD 0.310. Therefore, bitcoin and altcoins could either start a decent rebound soon or they might breakdown to new yearly lows. Total market capitalization  There were mostly range moves below the USD 3,450 resistance level in bitcoin price . BTC/USD seems to be struggling (UTC 08:20 AM) near the USD 3,450 and USD 3,500 resistances. A successful close above the USD 3,500 barrier could clear the path for buyers to take control in the near term.
If buyers continue to fail near the USD 3,450 and USD 3,500 resistances, there could be a strong bearish reaction. A break below the USD 3,350 level may perhaps accelerate losses towards the USD 3,300 or USD 3,220 levels. Ethereum price  failed recently near the USD 91 level and declined below USD 90. ETH/USD is currently consolidating just above USD 88, with resistances near the USD 91, USD 94, USD 96 and USD 98 levels. 
If there is no break above the stated levels and USD 100, the price might decline to USD 80 or even USD 75. A break above USD 100 could improve the market sentiment in favor of buyers. Bitcoin cash price  extended declines below the USD 98 support level. BCH/USD is down more than 1% and it is currently near USD 95. The main support is at USD 92, followed by USD 90. BCHSV is down around 5% and it is currently trading near the USD 85 support. If the price continues to slide, there could be a test of USD 80.
Ripple price  remained confined in a tight range above the USD 0.300 support. XRP/USD must surpass the USD 0.308 and USD 0.310 resistance levels to gain bullish momentum. If not, the price may drop significantly to USD 0.280 or USD 265. During the past few hours, a few small cap altcoins gained bullish momentum and jumped more than 10%, including BTCP, PAY, DEX, QTUM and WAVES. Out of these, BTCP rallied around 14% and PAY climbed close to 13%. The current price action is slightly bearish for bitcoin below USD 3,450. If BTC/USD continues to struggle, there is a high possibility of a breakdown below USD 3,350 and USD 3,300 in the near term. Conversely, if there is an upside break above USD 3,450 and USD 3,500, bitcoin and altcoins such as ethereum, ripple, eos and litecoin may stage a solid comeback.

BTC/USD tested the USD 3,325 level and later started consolidating in a range above USD 3,350. Ethereum price also declined and traded below the USD 90 support. However, the price remained above the USD 84 low and it is currently (UTC 08:10 AM) attempting a recovery towards USD 94. On the other hand, ripple price was stable and dips below USD 0.300 were well supported. The current technical structure suggests range trading before bitcoin makes the next move. Total market capitalization  There were further declines below the USD 3,440 level in bitcoin price . BTC/USD even broke the USD 3,400 support and traded towards the USD 3,300 level. It found support neat the USD 3,325 level and later the price corrected a few points. 
The price is currently trading just below the USD 3,400 level, above which there are chances of a recovery towards the USD 3,450 level. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,350 followed by USD 3,325. If there are more losses, the price may trade to a new yearly low below USD 3,225. Ethereum price  struggled to recover above the USD 94 and USD 95 resistance levels. ETH/USD declined further and it traded below the USD 90 level.
Buyers appeared near the USD 87 - USD 88 zone and the price is currently consolidating losses. On the upside, an initial hurdle is near the USD 92 level, above which the price may rise towards the USD 95 level. Bitcoin cash price  failed to stay above the USD 100 support and it recently declined around 3%. BCH/USD is currently trading near the USD 96 level, with an immediate support at USD 95 followed by USD 92. BCHSV declined below the USD 90 support recently before buyers appeared near the USD 85 level. It is currently recovering, but it may face sellers near USD 90 or USD 92.
Ripple price  dipped below the USD 0.300 support level, but it quickly recovered. XRP/USD is currently up around 0.5% and it may climb towards the USD 0.308 and USD 0.314 resistance levels. Despite bearish moves in bitcoin, a few small cap altcoins climbed higher by more than 10%, including DEX, CREDO, WAVES, XTZ, REP and PAY. Out of these, DEX rallied around 45% and CREDO climbed close to 36%. Overall, bitcoin seems to be trading in a range below USD 3,500 with a bearish angle. BTC/USD must climb above the USD 3,450 and USD 3,500 resistance levels to start a solid recovery. If not, there is a risk of more declines below USD 3,300 and USD 3,200 in the coming sessions. Similarly, ethereum could decline below USD 84 and USD 80 if it continues to fail near the USD 95 and USD 100 resistance levels.

The bottom might well happen in the first half of Q1 due to the recent acceleration in Bitcoin’s downward trend. They also believe that the Lightning Network’s success could prove crucial to wider Bitcoin usage.  The research paper, titled “The State of Bitcoin,” found that the primary source of selling in the most recent downturn for Bitcoin came from coin owners who have been holding for 3 to 5 years, and these very same HODLers seem close to exhausting their selling efforts. This is derived from UTXO (unspent transaction output) trends, which the paper says “have shown to be an impressively reliable predictor, albeit with a limited sample history, for price bottoms, future accumulation timing, and UTXO wave amplitudes.” The UTXO trend and subsequent price appreciation should line up with the Bitcoin block mining reward halving that is set to happen in 2020, when the reward will decrease from 12.5 to 6.25 bitcoins, but the research team believes that this will be the last reward halving to have a very significant impact on price. Block mining reward halving occurs once every 210,000 blocks, which translates to around once every four years. Historically, there have been two halvings: in 2012 and 2016, both of which were followed by significant bull runs.  Block mining reward halving and Bitcoin price chart: ____ The short-term outlook in the paper draws a parallel to 2013: back then, when the prices peaked in late 2013 and subsequently fell, they continued to slip even after year-over-year returns turned negative. It was roughly a year before Bitcoin returned to similar price levels. The price’s rise of late 2017 mimics that of 2013, as peak valuations were followed by an extended bear market, characterized by multiple relief rallies on the way to drastically lower prices, but the bottom does not seem to be too far off.  In the long run, Bitcoin may well replace offshore accounts as the means to holding private wealth. Once Bitcoin rises in popularity for this reason, more conservative institutions (central banks, state and local pension funds, etc.) are likely to follow suit as they become more comfortable with digital assets, the paper claims. The researchers remain optimistic, however: “Barring any major disruptions to its network, however, over the long run we foresee Bitcoin serving as a staple allocation in traditional investment portfolios, central bank reserves, and as a suitable alternative for a portion of assets held in offshore accounts.” But in order to be used as a currency, Bitcoin still has quite a way to go. “In order for Bitcoin to work as a medium of exchange, we believe it first needs to establish itself as a store of value to help reduce its volatility,” the paper states, adding that the current volatility of the asset makes it less likely for holders to spend it, as they believe it might become worth more in the future, and eliminating this possibility could be the nudge Bitcoin needs towards becoming a medium of exchange. ""If Lightning Network succeeds, it will enable Bitcoin to have nearly instant transactions and fees at potentially a fraction of a cent. This opens the door for fast micropayments where users could pay a penny to read an article or receive small tips from fans on social media. This provides unique advantages over the current web based payments infrastructure which is saddled with middle-men, delays in settlement, and high transaction fees,"" according to Delphi Digital.",-72.96000000000004,0

BTC/USD is currently (UTC 08:10 AM) trading near the USD 3,400 support level and it seems to be struggling near the USD 3,500 and USD 3,550 resistance levels. Ethereum clearly struggled to clear the USD 95 and USD 100 resistance levels. ETH/USD is currently trading below USD 90 and it may slide towards USD 85. Ripple price continues to consolidate near the USD 0.300 support, with an immediate resistance at USD 0.312. The price action is short term bearish unless bitcoin price breaks the USD 3,500 and USD 3,550 resistances in the coming sessions. Total market capitalization  There was a rejection noted near the USD 3,550 level in bitcoin price , resulting in a downward move. BTC/USD declined below the USD 3,450 support and it is currently down around 2%. An immediate support is at USD 3,400, below which the price could drop sharply towards the USD 3,250 support level.
On the flip side, if buyers continue to protect USD 3,400, there is a chance of an upward move towards the USD 3,500 level. However, the price must convincingly break the USD 3,500 and USD 3,550 resistance levels to stage a decent rebound in the near term. Ethereum price  is currently consolidating near the USD 88 - USD 90 area. ETH/USD was recently rejected near the USD 100 hurdle (the previous support zone).
If there are more losses below USD 88, the price may revisit the last swing low near USD 84. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 94, above which the price may retest the key USD 98 - USD 100 resistance zone. Bitcoin cash price  is down around 2.5% and it moved below the USD 100 support. It seems like BCH/USD may continue to correct lower towards the USD 95 support level. BCHSV is down more than 6% and it seems like buyers failed to hold gains above the USD 100 and USD 95 support levels. The next key support awaits near USD 90, below which the price may decline to USD 85.
Ripple price  is facing a solid resistance near the USD 0.312 and USD 0.320 levels. XRP/USD is currently consolidating above USD 0.300 and it may continue to trade in a range before the next move either above USD 0.320 or below USD 0.300. A few small cap altcoins declined more than 8% recently, including MOAC, FCT, MANA, DCR, ELF, R, MGO and KMD. Out of these, MOAC is down around 17% and FCT fell close to 13%. To sum up, bitcoin buyers seem to be facing a major resistance near the USD 3,500 and USD 3,550 levels. If BTC/USD fails to climb above USD 3,550, there is a chance of a fresh decline below USD 3,400 and 3,350 in the near term. Similarly, ethereum and ripple may decline heavily if they fail to move past USD 100 and USD 0.320 respectively.

Slate cites a study by Turkish researcher Twentify, which found that around 1 in 5 respondents said they had begun trading in cryptocurrencies after August this year, when the lira took a massive tumble in price. (However, since then it has recovered by 26% against the dollar.) Inflation in the country also remains high (21.62% year-on-year in November), another factor that has led investors to seek out ways to protect the value of their savings. Reuters reports that Turkish economic growth has “dwindled to 1.6% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2018” – down from 7% in 2017. TRY/USD chart: ____ Per a report in Turkish media outlet DHA, trading on certain Turkish crypto exchanges increased by 37% in November, peaking at a weekly increase of 72% in the week beginning November 12. However, the whole crypto market saw higher trading volumes in November due to huge sell off.  Meanwhile, Slate quotes Emin Gün Sirer, a Turkish-American professor at Cornell University, who says the country’s “relatively young population compared [to the rest of] Europe, and [their] flexible adoption of new technology provide the conditions for an eager market for cryptocurrency.” In a column for Hürriyet Daily News, journalist and business expert Ersu Ablak stated, “It makes me happy that the latest cryptocurrency investments involve Turkey [...] This is partly due to the fact that Turkish people are very adaptable to new technologies and new methods.” The country’s chief religious body, the Directorate of Religious Affairs, has previously ruled that cryptocurrency use is not permissible under Islamic law, but State author Sara Nasser concludes that, nonetheless, “cryptocurrency is an attractive, but risky dream” for many Turks. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, recently interacted with Turkish crypto-enthusiasts on Twitter, expressing his surprise at the size of the country’s crypto-community. Istanbul will also host one of the AME region’s biggest blockchain and cryptocurrency-themed forums, the Blockchain Economy Summit, in February next year. ____

However, some predictions garner special attention: for example, software tycoon John McAfee first said Bitcoin would reach USD 500,000 by the end of 2020 and promised he’d eat his external genitalia on national television if that doesn’t happen, later amending his prediction to say it’d go up to USD 1 million while the previous promise still stands. Because this is the internet, there is a website that follows McAfee’s prediction and measures how much Bitcoin would have to rise for McAfee’s nethers to stay intact. Also, the website, called bircoin.top, lets you add your own parameters to see how your own prediction would pan out, or even check other famous predictions.  __ McAfee announced his prediction on July 17th, 2017, and according to mathematics, the price would need to grow at a rate of around 0.5% per day from that day on to reach the predicted million. Although half a percent may not sound like much, it is still an exponential growth curve that gets steeper the further it goes. With this steady growth rate, Bitcoin would have to be worth USD 26,400 today for it to be on track for the end of 2020 - but it is scarcely above USD 3,500, around 86% less than what the prediction needs, or around 416 days behind. And there are many predictions: from Tom Lee, of Fundstrat Advisors, expecting USD 15,000 per bitcoin by the end of 2018, to Tim Draper betting on USD 250,000 per bitcoin by 2022. Meanwhile, data analyst Nick Maggiulli says that their mistake was making a prediction in the first place. “You CANNOT predict chaotic systems,” he adds in a tweet. Where did all these people go wrong?   When they made a Bitcoin price prediction in the first place. You CANNOT predict chaotic systems.  It’s the Three Body Problem. pic.twitter.com/IeMJQ761Sw Co-founder of first Chinese cryptocurrency exchange BTCC, Bobby Lee, took to Twitter to share his own opinion and ask the community to do the same. If history repeats perfectly, then the current bear market for #Bitcoin would bottom out at $2,500 next month, in Jan 2019.And then the next rally would start in late 2020, peak out in Dec 2021 at $333,000, and then crash back down to $41,000 in Jan 2023.Something like that?🙂 https://t.co/M8ljIVnt73 Later, Lee asked his followers whether this will happen - 59% of respondents believe in this, by the way, and over half believe that the peak of USD 333,000 is the least likely to happen out of all four predictions. However, all this proves is that anyone can make predictions. The community has always been skeptical, however, and many predictions (and the people making them) are notoriously wrong.

In his research, he found that the fundamentals are outperforming the prices currently, although all of them are down since December 2017 and January 2018. Although there are many who do not believe cryptocurrency networks have any fundamentals at all, Burniske believes that this role is filled by health of the supply-siders and demand-siders. Supply-siders are those who provision the network’s service, in most cases miners, and demand-siders are the ones who consume the service. The research focuses on Bitcoin and Ethereum, comparing how fundamentals and network values have performed since December 17th, 2017, and January 13th, 2018 - the peak network values for both.  What he found is that, although network values (“Network Value” = “Price per Unit” x “Units of the Cryptoasset Outstanding”) were down, the number of daily transactions as well as demand for their native functionality is not following suit. Hash rates, or processing power of a cryptocurrency network, of both are up compared to their peaks; although they are on negative slopes, they are still outperforming the price. Another supply-side component are developers, and Burniske writes that according to the internal analysis of venture firm Placeholder, of which he is a partner, those metrics are also outperforming the market. “Most asset classes have widely agreed-upon models to value them; analysts just bicker over the inputs to those models. In crypto, we currently bicker over both the models and the inputs, hence the insane whiplash of the markets,” Burniske concludes, adding that the growth of network fundamentals is sure to attract analysts which, in turn, will help stabilize the market. In reply to Burniske’s tweet featuring his article, the crypto community points out that taking the peak values from the December 17 - January 18 time frame means assuming that the market priced network value correctly back then. My main issue with your analysis, and I may be missing something obvious here, but - by using network value/fundamentals calculation at the peaks, it seems that you assume that the market priced network value correctly back then. “What if at the peak of the mania (at that seems to have been mania phase) [network value] got ahead of fundamentals by, say, 300%? Wouldn't it mean market still searches for a fair price which may be lower? Even if NV/fundamentals equations does not show that?” asks user @Staska.  Burniske wrote about that in a comment on Medium, “We could solve [the overvalued market problem] by looking at the cycles over time, checking in at troughs and peaks, and looking at the relative change in fundamentals and prices between the two. A more time intensive analysis, but doable.” However, he did not add whether he intends to do such research in the future. On this potential overvaluation also hangs the question: is the current market drop a justifiable correction? However, with the lack of data, “it’s clear to me that Mr. (Crypto) Market has only a vague idea of what he’s doing right now,” Burniske adds.",-109.39000000000033,0

BTC/USD tested the USD 3,200 - USD 3,220 support area and later recovered. The price traded above USD 3,400, but there are many resistances near USD 3,600 and USD 3,640. Ethereum price settled below the USD 100 support area. ETH/USD traded towards the USD 80 level and later started forming a support base near USD 85. Ripple price failed to surpass the USD 0.355 resistance and it recently tested the USD 0.300 support. The overall price structure is currently neutral above recent lows, with chances of a short term upside correction in bitcoin and altcoins. Total market capitalization  There was a decent upward move above the USD 3,400 resistance in bitcoin price . BTC/USD is currently up around 2% and it is trading near the USD 3,500 level. On the upside, an initial support is at USD 3,540, above which the price may test the USD 3,600 level. The main weekly resistance is near USD 3,640, above which there are chances of a decent rebound toward USD 4,000 and USD 4,200.
On the flip side, the USD 3,450 is a short term support. If buyers fail to surpass the USD 3,540 resistance, there could be a fresh drop below the USD 3,450 and USD 3,400 supports. The key weekly support is at USD 3,200, below which the price may even decline below USD 3,000 or USD 2,800. Ethereum price  declined heavily this past week and settled below the USD 100 level. ETH/USD traded close to the USD 80 level and later it corrected higher.
On the upside, the price is facing a couple of important hurdles near USD 95 and USD 100. A daily close above the USD 100 level could really boost the market sentiment in favor of buyers. If there is no break and close above USD 100, the price may decline towards USD 80 or USD 75. Bitcoin cash  is back above the USD 100 support. BCH/USD must break the USD 110 and USD 120 resistance levels to start a decent rebound in the near term. On the other hand, BCHSV declined below USD 100 and it is currently trading above the USD 98 support below which the price may slide towards USD 92.
Ripple price  climbed back above USD 0.300 and it is currently consolidating losses. XRP/USD is facing resistance near the USD 0.310 and USD 0.315 levels, and supports on the downside are USD 0.300 and USD 0.292. A few small cap altcoins gained bullish momentum recently and jumped more than 8%, including DEX, CENNZ, ELF, XIN, MAID, ETP and EOS. Out of these, DEX rallied more than 50% and CENNZ is up close to 20%. Overall, bitcoin price is currently consolidating above USD 3,400. To start a substantial recovery, BTC/USD must break the USD 3,640 resistance. If not, there is a risk of a fresh bearish wave in bitcoin and altcoins like ethereum, ripple, litecoin, eos, neo and tron in the near term.

Now, even the two “stars” of this week - Waves (-20%) and Factom (-31%) - fell sharply, trimming their weekly gains to 25% and 12% respectively (UTC 06:15 AM).

As you can see, we're currently testing the light support level at USD 3,500 (blue). If it breaks through to the downside we will likely encounter heavy support at USD 3,000 yellow. The red line is set at USD 1,800. All of these levels have played a significant role during the rise of 2017,"" the analyst wrote in a daily commentary on Thursday. According to him, for institutional investors looking to invest in the assets rather than the infrastructure, there really isn't much reason to go in strong at the moment. ""There simply isn't FOMO [fear of missing out],"" Greenspan stressed. ""However thinking long term, if we do think that bitcoin will pass through the all-time highs anytime within the next decade, it won't make much sense to wait until it USD 1,500 to start placing orders. Rather, large traders tend to set small orders in order to average out their entries,"" he added.

Together with Stellar and EOS, ETH was one of the biggest losers among the top 10 coins over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency also experienced an extremely unusual event overnight when it saw a flash-crash on the Coinbase Pro platform, briefly sending it down to USD 13 before recovering, in what can only be described as a spectacular flash-crash. Coinbase Pro responded to the incident, simply saying they are “aware of price movement,” without admitting any kind of fault: So market selling through 88% of the orderbook on eth/usdc is working as normal ? It is still unclear exactly what caused the sudden drop in the ETH price, but the extremely quick sell-off and subsequent recovery is likely a sign of trading algorithms creating a snowball effect, for example triggered by a large order or a “fat finger” entering a wrong order. The second major happening overnight was Bitcoin SV, the Bitcoin Cash fork that came into existence on November 15, overtaking the more mainstream Bitcoin ABC (usually referred to simply as Bitcoin Cash) in terms of market capitalization.

In the community, many speculate if this is just a short-lived attempt from the Bitcoin SV camp and its main backer Craigh “faketoshi” Wright at pumping up the price of their coin. If that’s the case, the pumpers are likely to run out of new capital soon and the rally may be short-lived. Bitcoin Cash has seen a particularly sharp decline over recent weeks, as the internal divide in the BCH community has hurt both sides badly. As reported, Stellar overtook BCH as the 4th most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap.

BTC/USD followed a negative trajectory and declined below the USD 3,800 and USD 3,750 supports. A new yearly low was formed below USD 3,700 before the price bounced back. Ethereum also declined heavily and broke the USD 105 and USD 100 support levels. Buyers appeared near USD 95 and later ETH/USD moved back above USD 100. On the other hand, declines in ripple were limited, but the price remained below the USD 0.355 and USD 0.350 support levels. Total market capitalization  There was a downside extension in bitcoin price  below the USD 3,850 support level. BTC/USD declined below the USD 3,800 and USD 3,750 levels and spiked below the USD 3,700 level. A new yearly low was formed near USD 3,670 and later the price bounced back above USD 3,800.
The price is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) flat around USD 3,860, with an immediate resistance near the USD 3,900 level. Above USD 3,900, the price could trade towards the key USD 4,000 resistance, which is likely to act as a strong resistance. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,800 followed by the USD 3,750 pivot zone. Ethereum price  struggled to break the USD 110 resistance, resulting in declines below USD 105. ETH/USD even broke the USD 100 support and traded to a new yearly low around USD 95.
Later, the price bounced back and traded above the USD 100 level. It is currently down 3% to USD 102, with an initial resistance at USD 105, above which the next key resistance is near the USD 110 level. Bitcoin cash  is under a lot of pressure and it is again down around 10% to USD 125. BCH declined below the USD 140 support recently and if sellers remain in action, the price could trade towards the USD 110 level. On the other hand, BCHSV traded higher by more than 5% and it is currently trading near the USD 90 level.
Ripple price  declined towards the USD 0.325 support area where buyers emerged. XRP/USD recovered and it is currently trading near USD 0.342, above which the price may test the USD 0.350 resistance. Many few small cap altcoins declined recently by more than 8% and moved further into a bearish zone, including DEX, XTZ, WAVES, MKR, AE, BTM, MITH, AION and BTS. Out of these, DEX is down around 16% and XTZ fell close to 15%. The current price action is still bearish below USD 4,000 for bitcoin. Should buyers push BTC/USD above the USD 4,000 resistance, there could be a decent recovery. If not, the price is likely to slide again below USD 3,800 and USD 3,700. Likewise, ethereum price must settle above USD 100 and move above USD 110, USD 115 and USD 120. If buyers continue to struggle, ETH/USD may extend declines below USD 95 and USD 90.

BTC/USD corrected above the USD 3,950 and USD 4,000 resistance levels, but sellers protected further gains above the USD 4,050 level. There was a fresh drop and the price moved below the USD 3,900 level. Similarly, ethereum price failed to settle above the USD 110 - USD 112 resistance and declined again. Ripple price is down more than 3% after it failed to break the USD 0.360 resistance level. The current (UTC 08:20 AM) market sentiment is bearish, suggesting more losses in bitcoin and altcoins in the short term. Total market capitalization  There was a slow and steady decline in bitcoin price  after buyers failed to clear the USD 4,050 level. BTC/USD moved down and traded below the USD 4,000 and USD 3,930 supports. An immediate support is near USD 3,800, below which there is a risk of a sharp decline towards the USD 3,600 level.
On the other hand, the price is facing many resistances near the USD 3,900 and USD 4,000 levels. A successful close above USD 4,000 may lift the market sentiment. Still, the price must break the USD 4,050 swing high for a decent rebound in the near term. Ethereum price  failed to gain pace above the USD 113 level, resulting in a fresh decline. ETH/USD is down more than 3% and it is currently trading well below the USD 110 level.
An initial support is at USD 105, below which the price may revisit the USD 100 support zone. To recover, buyers need to surpass the USD 112 and USD 115 resistance levels. Bitcoin cash  is down more than 10% and it traded below the USD 150 and USD 145 support levels. BCH is under a lot of pressure and it seems like it could even break the USD 130 level. BCHSV is also declined more than 7% and traded below the USD 90 support. The next support is at USD 82, below which the price may test USD 75.
Ripple price  faced a lot of selling interest near the USD 0.360 and USD 0.362 levels. XRP/USD declined and moved below the USD 0.355 support level. It seems like sellers are aiming for a test of the USD 0.332 support. Many few small cap altcoins faced an increased selling pressure and declined more than 8%, including NEXO, NPXS, MITH, EOS, ETP, AE, ETC, GXS, MANA, THETA and BAT. Out of these, NEXO is down around 20% and NPXS fell nearly 12%. However, Waves jumped by more than 33% in the past 24 hours due to positive news. Overall, bitcoin is back in a negative zone below USD 4,000. As long as BTC/USD is trading below the USD 4,100 and USD 4,200 pivot levels, there is a risk of more downsides in the near future. Ethereum also faces a major risk of heavy declines below USD 100 if buyers fail to push ETH/USD back above the USD 115 and USD 120 resistance levels.

Late last week, unofficial reports surfaced of the exchange launching these plans, first reported by Bloomberg. Joseph Christinat, VP of Nasdaq’s media team, spoke to the UK’s daily tabloid The Express yesterday and confirmed the plans. The VP states that these futures will be listed and launched in the first half of 2019—no official date has been given at this time. The launch still remains subject to approval from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Christinat told The Express: “We’ve put a hell of a lot of money and energy into delivering the ability to do this and we’ve been all over it for a long time—way before the market went into turmoil, and that will not affect the timing of this in any way. No. Period. We’re doing this no matter what.” This is a positive announcement for crypto enthusiasts. Most crypto-related projects that sprouted up in 2017 were knee-jerk reactions to what was hot in the market. This, however, seems like a thoroughly thought out plan that has been brewing for a while. Joseph Christinat’s interview did not confirm whether Nasdaq’s Bitcoin futures will be cash-backed or physically settled. Bakkt will be launching the first physically delivered Bitcoin futures in this coming January. Cash-settled Bitcoin futures came into the market in December of 2017 by the CBOE and CME Group. >> CVS Health, Aetna, UnitedHealth Group, and Humana Trial Blockchain Technology for Healthcare Back in November 2017, Nasdaq announced the target launch of their Bitcoin futures to be by mid-2018. Their plans hit a snag when Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies began tumbling in the first half of 2018. These plans were pushed back to create a “unique enough” offering to the market. According to CoinMarketCap, BTC is currently trading at $4,029.40 a coin, up 1.34%, in 24 hours. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© koydesign",70.59999999999991,1

It has helped to increase profitability for those who still run their mining rigs, but strengthened fears of centralization.  The mining difficulty of Bitcoin is adjusted every two weeks (every 2016 blocks, to be precise) to maintain the normal 10-minute block time. This means that if there are many miners competing amongst themselves and propagating blocks in less than ten minutes, the difficulty of the next puzzle will be increased; if there are few miners and it takes them much longer to find a solution, the difficulty is decreased - both times just enough to keep block times at around 10 minutes.  Now, the difficulty might drop another 16% after two weeks, according to estimations by major mining pool BTC.com. In that case, it would almost reach the difficulty levels seen in May/June.  According to previous reports, between 600,000 and 800,000 Bitcoin miners have pulled the plug on their operations in the second half of November. Market analysis firm Autonomous Research estimates that at least 100,000 individual miners have shut down, and advisory firm Fundstrat Global Advisors adds that since early September, about 1.4 million servers have been unplugged, Bloomberg reported on Monday. This flush out took the Bitcoin’s hash rate (or computing power) with it, as it is down 36% from its all-time high this September. As reported, miners are under growing pressure as the bitcoin price dropped by 80% since its all-time high in December of 2017. In November bitcoin lost 37% of its value, dropping below USD 4,000.  The CEO of China-based crypto mining pool F2Pool Shixing Mao said back in September that the break-even point for Bitcoin mining was between USD 3,891 and USD 11,581, depending on the equipment being used. At that time, BTC traded for around USD 6,400.  However, popular economist and Bitcoin investor Tuur Demeester stressed:  ""Bitcoin Mining breakeven cost"" is confusing as a general concept, because it implies a static BTC revenue per hash. However hashrate rewards adjust dynamically, via biweekly difficulty adjustment and the fee market. With the mining difficulty down as well, the remaining miners should have an easier job. However, Malachi Salcido, head of Wenatchee, one of the largest North American miners, told Bloomberg that only a select few can afford to stay in the game: miners with scale, very specific business models and extremely low electricity costs, which is the case in Douglas County where his own miners are based. Margins before costs like depreciation and taxes dropped from about 40% to 20% during the slide, but they jumped back up at the company to around 40% as smaller rivals shuttered operations, Salcido said. However, some fear a 51% attack in case some of the remaining mining companies decide to band together. The community is much more optimistic, though: they remind that the biggest ever drop of -18% back in 2011 brought to a price increase of 150% - from USD 2 to USD 5 in around 60 days.  Although many say that previous patterns are no guarantee for the future - “Just because it happened before, it does not mean it will happen again,” writes Reddit user u/Red5point1 - not all agree with that sentiment. As u/Mowglio points out, “Sure, historical data does not guarantee future results, but it is literally what all scientific analysis is based on. Throwing it to the wind as if it doesn't matter is one of the dumbest things you can do.”

New posts, like one on his/hers social network P2PFoundation profile, seem to indicate that he/she has not left the world for good. But is it him/her, an impostor, or a practical joke? The first seemingly significant thing that happened in November was the appearance of a Twitter account under the handle @satoshi (now closed by Twitter), which tweeted, “I do not want to be public, but, there is an issue with SegWit. If it is not fixed, there will be nothing and I would have failed. There is only one way that Bitcoin survives and it is important to me that it works. Important enough, that I may be known openly.” The tweet appeared on November 16th - incidentally, one day after the already infamousBitcoin Cash hard fork. There had been previous tweets as well, mostly copy-pasted sentences from the Bitcoin whitepaper, as well as some numbers that are actually just plugged into formulae to calculate the probability of a successful attack on the network. The above mentioned tweet is the first one not to quote the whitepaper directly. However, the account was later suspended. Then, on November 29th, Satoshi’s P2PFoundation profile showed some activity for the first time since early 2011. First, it added a guy named Wagner Tamanaha to its friends list, and then posed a single word, “nour,” which many from the community point out means “light” in Arabic.  However, there are claims that the email used by the account is [email protected], which was allegedly hacked back in 2014. The hacking incident was first brought to light on the Bitcointalk forum, where a user claimed to have received a message from that address writing, “Michael, send me some coins before I hitman you,” and pointing out that this is not really Satoshi’s usual style. Now, this could well mean that the P2PFoundation profile was compromised as well. And that’s what most of the community seems to agree on: all of this is probably fake. Reddit user u/mr_li_jr writes, “If anyone wants to claim to be Satoshi, they can move his coins. Anything else can be faked or hacked,” and this sentiment is echoed by most of the community throughout several social networks.  It would seem that the big question behind it was never the validity of the posts, but who’s behind them and why? Most of the community readily points at Craig Wright, often dubbed Faketoshi due to his claim that he is Satoshi Nakamoto and general lack of any sort of proof. The timing of the tweet claiming that Satoshi might reveal himself is suspicious enough, as it is a day after the BCH hard fork, when it seemed that Bitcoin SV, backed by Wright, would lose the battle.  Wright’s Twitter account is a cesspool of cryptic tweets. On the same day when the @satoshi account wrote its last tweet, Wright wrote, “I have done all I can for now to warn people. I will work to make the system right, it is not you, it is not your profit, it is sound money for the world. If you cannot understand that, I cannot make you. I hope that your children will,” later adding, “About a year from now, I have something to release, but, right now, I cannot. So, the place is marked and saved, and in the time it takes, you will find what that is... when it is fixed.” Wright also wrote two tweets in Arabic around 7 hours after Satoshi’s “nour” post, both of which contain the word “light” in it. One translates to, “The light haunts the darkness,” while the other means, “The light of the world in trade.” Neither of those were subsequently explained, however.  Now the community is debating on whether the “Satoshi” accounts are controlled by Wright, or if he’s as clueless as the rest of the community but just trying to connect himself to those posts. Most believe that the latter is the case: Redditor u/HiTierChris writes, “There is a huge time difference between when Craig posted that and when that was posted from Satoshi's profile. Is there a possibility that Satoshi actually posted that and Craig saw that and now is pretending that it's him?” and u/JasonLeeH replies, “Yes, that's exactly what is happening.” However, this option also implies that if the accounts are neither owned by Satoshi or Wright, there is yet another Faketoshi in the game - Faketoshi v2.0, if you will. Maybe they’re trolling, maybe they want to spread FUD in the community, or maybe they’re just kids who are having a few laughs. Still, another unknown element in the game seriously hinders the possibility of ever discovering who Satoshi really is.  But should we discover it in the first place? Many in the community are content with letting sleeping dogs lie, while some are actively warning against demystifying the creator of the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Some even warn that it could put Satoshi in danger. Whether or not Satoshi is still alive, following the crypto market or not, or maybe even debating coming back into the spotlight, one fact remains: nobody will believe him/her until he proves he/she has access to the original Satoshi’s private key, as well as funds. Until then, listening to the FUD can only be harmful in the long run. The question remains: does it matter who Satoshi is, and would his/her reappearance really change anything?",-253.1899999999996,0

It’s not the best service for private messaging as every single message is recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, which means that they are public and can never be modified or deleted. This fun service isn’t that revolutionary, as it has been possible to add messages on the Bitcoin blockchain since its inception. For example, Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, included this message in the Genesis Block, or the first-ever block of Bitcoin: ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."" Meanwhile, this year, TD Ameritrade, an online broker, planted their literal flag on the Bitcoin’s blockchain, effectively making an advertisement for themselves. However, “Blockchains are forever” makes this much easier. Just type in your message, choose whether you want your message to show on the Bitcoin blockchain or testnet, choose your payment method (via the Lightning Network or the regular Bitcoin payment), pay, and voilá! Your message is “immortalized.” This is what people are sending into eternity: It won’t cost you a lot to try “Blockchains are forever” as sending one message is less than 5 US dollar cents. However, you are only allowed to send 80 characters in a single message. So, if you are planning to add a wall of text to the Bitcoin blockchain, be sure to stock up with BTC first. Cryptonews.com covered two similarly creative crypto projects previously. The first one is Steem Whale, which allows you to make an artificial whale fountain squirt by sending the Steem cryptocurrency.  Another fun project is Satoshi’s Place, a graffiti board to show the power and capabilities of the Lightning Network. There’re one million pixels on the canvas with each costing 1 satoshi to paint. Even if you draw something large, it won’t cost you a lot. But be aware: others can respray your art! Hower, immutability of public blockchains is being used to send serious messages, also.

On the Monday morning, it's among top 3 ETPs by performance and turnover. In comparison, on November 26, or six days after its launch, the ETP managed to reach the CHF 425,712 (USD 426,601) turnover, topping the list of ETPs. Similar to the better-known exchange traded funds (ETFs), exchange traded product (ETP) is the name given to the broader category of financial derivatives instruments that are traded on public stock exchanges. ETPs encompasses ETFs, exchange traded notes (ETNs), and various tradable certificates. The fund, named Amun Crypto ETP – with the fitting ticker code “HODL” – is designed as a weighted basket of 5 popular cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple XRP, Ether, and Litecoin, and is available for both retail investors and financial institutions. Bitcoin makes up nearly half of the fund, Ripple has around 30%, Ethereum almost 16%, and Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin each around 3%. Since going live on November 21, the ETP has seen mixed performance, in-line with the performance of the overall crypto market, which has also had a rough November. So far, the fund is down about 16% since its launch, but just like the major cryptocurrencies, it has also bounced up by more than 7% from a bottom that was reached on November 27. According to Richard Johnson, market structure expert at Greenwich Associates, a market intelligence and advisory firm, some of the interest in the HODL ETP may be due to large institutions seeking opportunities to profit from arbitrage trading between the ETP and the physical market for the underlying cryptocurrencies, The Block reported last week. How successful this arbitrage trading has been is unclear, but the persistent interest from large trading firms suggests that there is money to be made this way.  According to a Bloomberg report, trading firms Jane Street and Flow Traders provided liquidity to the ETP during its launch, and continues to actively trade it. However, both firms reportedly decline to comment on the extent of their current trading activities in the new ETP.",-253.1899999999996,0

However, BTC/USD failed to gain pace above USD 4,400 and declined later. The price is now back in a bearish zone and it is trading (UTC 08:30 AM) near key supports at USD 4,000 and USD 3,700. Similarly, ethereum price failed to break the major resistance at USD 125 - USD 126 and later declined. Ripple price too struggled to surpass the USD 0.400 barrier, which later resulted in a fresh decline in XRP/USD. The current market sentiment is bearish and if bitcoin price dives below USD 4,000, there could be an increase in selling pressure. Total market capitalization  After failing to trade past USD 4,400, bitcoin price  declined below the USD 4,350 and USD 4,300 support levels. BTC/USD sellers gained traction below USD 4,200 and pushed the price towards the USD 4,000 support.
The price is currently down around 4% and it is consolidating near the USD 4,000 support. If there is a downside break, the price could test the USD 3,920 support. However, the main weekly support is at USD 3,700, below which the price could trade to new yearly lows. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 4,100 followed by the weekly swing zone near USD 4,220. Ethereum price  was rejected near the USD 125 - USD 126 resistance area. Later, there was a downside correction and ETH/USD declined below the USD 115 and USD 112 support levels.
The price is currently trading above the USD 110 support, below which the price could trade towards the crucial weekly support at USD 102. On the upside, the USD 116 level is an initial resistance. However, a successful close above the USD 125 level is needed for bullish acceleration in the near term. Bitcoin cash  extended declines below the USD 200 and USD 180 support levels. BCH is currently down around 6% and it is approaching the USD 160 support. The next key support is at USD 150 followed by USD 145. BCHSV is also down around 5% and it is trading below the USD 100 support. The next major support is at USD 90, followed by USD 82.
Ripple price  failed to break the USD 0.400 resistance and declined. XRP/USD traded below the USD 0.482 and USD 0.475 supports and it is currently trading just above the USD 0.360 support level. A few small cap altcoins declined recently between 8% - 15%, including BTCP, THETA, STEEM, FCT, RVN, PPT and ICX. Out of these, BTCP is down around 13% and THETA declined close to 12%. To sum up, bitcoin price is clearly struggling to rebound with strength above USD 4,200 and USD 4,400. As long as there is no weekly close above USD 4,500, BTC/USD remains at a risk of more losses. On the downside, the main supports are USD 3,920 and USD 3,700, below which sellers may perhaps aim USD 3,400, which could increase selling pressure on altcoins like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin, eos and tron.

BCHSV moved back below the USD 100 support and it will most likely decline further towards the USD 92 or USD 90 support.
Ripple price  climbed higher towards the USD 0.400 weekly resistance where sellers emerged. XRP/USD declined and traded below the USD 0.390 and USD 0.380 support levels. The next support is at USD 0.370, below which buyers could defend USD 0.360. A few small cap altcoins gained traction and traded higher more than 8%, including CENNZ, THETA, LINK and FCT. Out of these, CENNZ is up around 14% and THETA gained nearly 13%. To sum up, bitcoin price is currently correcting lower after it failed to clear the USD 4,400 resistance level. BTC/USD may perhaps continue to correct lower, but the USD 4,000 support could stop declines. Likewise, ethereum and ripple are currently correcting lower and approaching key supports where buyers may reappear.

At press time, the world’s first digital currency is currently trading above $4,300. The entire crypto community is buzzing, as most altcoins have followed BTC’s upward movements. The cryptocurrency community took a huge hit in mid-November when Bitcoin Cash miners started a hash war. Investors lost confidence in the maturity of the community, as the war dragged out after Bitcoin Cash split in two. On one side was Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com, who led the Bitcoin ABC movement. On the other was Craig Wright, also known as ‘Faketoshi’ by the crypto community, who led Bitcoin SV. Very much like the split of the Ethereum blockchain with Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Cash was split into Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin ABC. During that mess, Bitcoin (BTC) and most altcoins began to plummet. While the Bitcoin Cash mess hasn’t fully cleared, it seems investors have gained their confidence back in crypto once more. There has been a lot of crypto-positive news that has debuted this morning—which should boost investor confidence even further. Ohio becomes the first state to allow businesses to pay taxes with Bitcoin https://t.co/iGo7RtHri2 pic.twitter.com/rhKBHzoqzO — CNN Business (@CNNBusiness) November 29, 2018  As for the news in the tweet above, it remains unclear how many businesses will actually use this means of paying taxes, but it is a positive movement for the crypto community. Perhaps the biggest Bitcoin news of the day came from the Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Yesterday, at the Consensus conference, Jeff Sprecher was asked, “Will digital assets survive?” “The unequivocal answer is yes,” Sprecher replied. “As an exchange operator it’s not our objective to opine on prices.” He went on to explain that there are thousands of digital tokens out there that can be argued are ‘better’ than Bitcoin, and yet it continues to survive and gain mainstream attention. Sprecher continued: “Often times in finance, it’s not about being the best—it turns out to be about being the broadest and the most commonly accepted and for whatever reason bitcoin has become that.” >> Will Bitcoin (BTC) Hit $15,000 Again?

According to Simon Choi, a senior researcher at the South Korean antivirus company Hauri, North Korean hackers have previously targeted crypto exchanges, but now, as direct attacks against exchanges have become harder, they are after individual digital currency users, South China Morning Post reported.  Since April 2018, the South Korean cybersecurity firm Cuvepia detected over 30 cases where North Korean hackers allegedly targeted crypto users, the company’s CEO, Kwon Seok-chul stated, according to the report. Kwon added that some cases might have gone undetected, so he estimates that the possible number of the hacks could be as high as 100. According to the report, hackers send infected email attachments with malware, so they can take over control of a crypto user’s device when the attachment is opened. Most of the victims of the recent hacks were wealthy South Korean cryptocurrency users as hackers believe that they could steal “billions” from these targets, Choi said. As mentioned, in the past, hackers were targeting crypto related institutions. For example, earlier this year, North Korean hackers had reportedly attacked an unnamed South Korean cryptocurrency exchange. The attackers tried to breach the exchange four times, but every attempt was unsuccessful. North Korea was also reportedly responsible for compromising 36,000 user accounts on the South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb and Coinis’ USD 2 million raid in 2017.  Furthermore, according to the IT security firm McAfee, North Korean hackers were behind the attack on Turkey’s financial industry and government organizations where the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities of Adobe Flash to inject malware to the victims’ computers.",9.850000000000364,1

This serves as an important reminder that Bitcoin is not anonymous, but pseudonymous, and that this can be used to track transactions. The money comes from the SamSam ransomware scheme, which targeted over 200 known victims, including corporations, hospitals, universities, and government agencies, in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada since 2015. The malicious actors held their victims’ data hostage in order to collect ransom, paid in bitcoin. The two identified bitcoin addresses (149w62rY42aZBox8fGcmqNsXUzSStKeq8C and 1AjZPMsnmpdK2Rv9KQNfMurTXinscVro9V) connected to this scheme have reportedly seen over 7,000 bitcoin transactions through various cryptocurrency exchanges to exchange around 6,000 BTC into Iranian rial. The OFAC clarifies, however, that not all of those funds stem from the SamSam scheme.  Supposedly, the two addresses belong to Ali Khorashadizadeh and Mohammad Ghorbaniyan, who were “central to the SamSam ransomware scheme’s success,” according to OFAC. This is also the first time that the Office publicly attributed crypto addresses to individuals, and they warn, “Regardless of whether a transaction is denominated in a digital currency or traditional fiat currency, OFAC compliance obligations are the same.” The release also adds, “As a result of today’s action, persons that engage in transactions with Khorashadizadeh and Ghorbaniyan could be subject to secondary sanctions.” Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker said, “Treasury is targeting digital currency exchangers who have enabled Iranian cyber actors to profit from extorting digital ransom payments from their victims [...] We are publishing digital currency addresses to identify illicit actors operating in the digital currency space.” The term “pseudonymity,” often used to describe Bitcoin’s modus operandi, derives from pseudonym, meaning “false name.” This means that you are simply using a fake name that can be traced back to you, as you’re not completely anonymous (“nameless”). In the original Bitcoin whitepaper, it was recommended that Bitcoin users use a new address for each transaction to avoid the transactions being linked to a common owner. However, there are still ways to trace these transactions as well. Many cryptocurrencies (so-called privacy coins) exist for the sole reason of “correcting” pseudonymity, as it is often seen as a weakness of Bitcoin, with the most popular example being Monero.  This is also not the first time that the US has cracked down on crypto criminals: only recently, a crypto trader has received 15 months of prison time for misappropriating more than USD 1.1 million worth of Bitcoin and Litecoin.",9.850000000000364,1

What they didn’t predict was a Bitcoin rally. On Sunday, the world’s first digital currency hit just above $3,600 a coin, which is the coin’s record-low this year. Bitcoin hadn’t seen below $3,700 since mid-September 2017, and this past week, the cryptocurrency was down almost -40% for the month. However, on Tuesday night that all began to shift. In around 60 minutes, Bitcoin jumped up in price over $200. While this isn’t the monumental rise it had on a daily basis in late-2017, the jump shows a positive trend. Major sells-offs began when the miners behind Bitcoin Cash started a civil war. The digital currency was set for its semi-annual upgrade and was split into two competing digital currencies after its hard fork. There were other contributing factors to the sell-offs, but the hash war exposed the immaturity of these projects and lost a lot of investor trust. What may have spiked the Bitcoin rally last night was the recently released news of Nasdaq still planning to launch its own Bitcoin futures in the first quarter of 2019. This step could bring more institutional investors into the playing field, without them needing to actually buy the digital currency. Many investors have been patiently waiting for Bitcoin ETFs to roll out, but Jay Clayton, the Executive Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has yet to confirm the decision. >> ADAM will Set a Code of Conduct for Crypto Participants “What investors expect is that the trading in that commodity that’s underlying the ETF is trading that makes sense, is free from the risk or significant risk of manipulation,” Clayton reportedly told the Consensus Invest Conference in Manhattan. “Those kinds of safeguards don’t exist in many of the markets where digital currencies trade.” The SEC is expected to announce its decision in late December. If approved, investors would be able to buy into Bitcoin without having to deal with cryptocurrency exchanges. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $4,202.51 a coin, up 12.71%, in 24 hours. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Syda_Productions",434.9500000000003,1

Well, the interest in the Bitcoin price and whether Bitcoin is dead, to be precise.  Also, it is not popular to look for information on Bitcoin adoption or where this cryptocurrency could be spent. However, possibly the good news is that people are still more interested in buying than selling bitcoin. (Of course, those who already own cryptocurrency most likely know how to sell it, as the market crash showed.) Now, let's take a closer look at graphs.    Looking at the data from Google trends for the past three months, it seems as the number of searches for the term 'bitcoin' has more than doubled. As expected in these volatile times, the term 'bitcoin price' has also seen an increase in interest. The majority of the interest falls to African countries, with Nigeria leading the charge, followed by Ghana and South Africa. Interestingly enough, the tiny island of Saint Helena has also made the list, with a significant percentage of queries coming from the speck of land in the South Atlantic Ocean. With the recent price crash that has seen bitcoin move down from USD 6,400 mere weeks ago, another interesting term is getting more attention – 'is bitcoin dead'. Canada, the US, as well as Australia and South Africa, are most interested in this term.  Reasons as to why the sudden increase in interest is nothing but pure speculation, although it is safe to assume that it is driven mostly by high volatility and price fluctuations we’ve seen in the past few weeks. Such events draw the attention of the media, and with them – the general public. It is unlikely that it was the other way around, with interest in cryptocurrencies running the prices into the ground. However, as mentioned above, interest in buying bitcoin is still much higher than in selling or spending it. In Google's charts at least.",434.9500000000003,1

As reported in October, the US company Odyssey Group planned to install 150 Bitcoin ATMs in the Latin American country totaling 1,600 machines by the end of 2019. Moreover, another company, Athena Bitcoin that had set up the first crypto cash point in Argentina, has also stated that it expects to have a total of 30 machines in the country by the end of 2018. However, it seems that the country won’t see dozens of new Bitcoin ATMs anytime soon. Odyssey Group has postponed its plans and now estimates to enter the market during the next six months, the Next Web reported, citing CEO Sebastian Ponceliz. According to the report, he claims that the reason for postponing Argentina’s Bitcoin ATM upgrade is due to the central bank of the country and the organization’s local market partners that allegedly asked the company to adjust “all the legal and technical requirements” that were “demanded” by the aforementioned parties. However, the report stressed that the company has previously made multiple promises that have yet to come true. In September 2017, the subsidiary of the company, Octagon, planned to install 250 crypto ATMs in Buenos Aires by October. While in May 2018, Ponceliz announced that his company had reached an agreement with Argentina’s central bank to roll out 4,000 machines. Moreover, in the same interview, the CEO claimed that 200 ATMs had been set up in the Latin American country. But that did not happen, according to Coin ATM Radar that shows only four working crypto cash points in the country, all installed by Athena. At press time, Athena did not respond to a request for comment. Bitcoin ATMs in Buenos Aires: ____ Meanwhile, the Argentinian Peso has been in a great decline since the start of this year.  ARS / USD rate: However, the fact that fiat currencies tend to be more volatile in Latin America brings ""a tremendous opportunity for adoption across the region,"" according to some investors. For example, OKGroup, the owner of the major crypto-to-crypto exchange OKEx, has entered the region via its fiat-to-crypto exchange OKCoin, which offers its services in more than 110 countries. “As the value of Argentina’s fiat currency remains uncertain, our hope is that we can help bring some stability to the country’s economy by providing Argentines with an array of cryptocurrency options,"" OKCoin’s Latin American representative, Pablo Magro, told Cryptonews.com earlier in November.

All top 20 coins are seeing gains on Wednesday. It seems that buyers once again has hit the markets, after selling has brought prices of most coins down to levels that some would consider “cheap” again. This comes at the same time as a range of positive news developments have been revealed regarding the much-anticipated institutional entry into crypto.  Let’s go through them one by one: Nasdaq, the second-largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization, aims to allow Bitcoin futures trading in the first quarter of 2019, despite the market crash this year, Bloomberg reported, citing “two people familiar with the matter.”  The Nasdaq futures will be based off the Bitcoin’s price on numerous spot exchanges, as compiled by VanEck Associates Corp., according to the report. This comment was uttered by Jeffrey Sprecher, the founder and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) when asked about the recent decline in bitcoin prices during the CoinDesk’s Consensus conference in New York on Tuesday. ICE is the parent company and an important backer of the new Bakkt platform, which is widely expected to bring more institutional liquidity into the bitcoin market.  Sprecher was joined on stage by Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler, who echoed the same sentiment by saying “the price is being expressed but there’s a lot of missing infrastructure and use cases,” thus suggesting that prices may recover once the “missing infrastructure” is put in place, according to Coindesk. However, as reported, the launch date of the Bakkt platform will be pushed back to January 24, 2019, from an originally scheduled release in December of this year.  The retail investors in crypto are becoming more reasonable, while institutions are starting to establish a foothold for the long-term, Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at insurance and investment giant Allianz said during the same conference on Tuesday. The highly regarded economist further said that he believes cryptocurrencies “will exist,” and that they will become “more and more widespread,” Reuters reported. However, he also added a word of caution to some of the most outspoken crypto enthusiasts, saying “[cryptocurrencies] will not be [as] dominant as some of the early adopters believed them to be.” Meanwhile, at the same conference, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton reiterated the SEC’s stance that bitcoin is not a security. “An asset like bitcoin, where it’s designed to be a replacement for sovereign currencies, we’ve determined that doesn’t have the attributes of a security,” Clayton said, according to Yahoo Finance. However, when it came to the much-anticipated bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF), Clayton’s comments were not so positive. On the issue of a potential ETF approval, Clayton explained that whatever asset an ETF is based on must be “free from the risk of manipulation.” He added that this is “an issue that needs to be addressed before I would be comfortable [with approving a bitcoin ETF].” And it looks like the crypto industry is trying to address these issues. In the US, a new crypto association has emerged that aims to establish a Code of Conduct for emerging digital asset markets.  Ten financial services and technology firms, including Galaxy Digital, Paxos, Genesis Global Trading among others, launched the Association for Digital Asset Markets (ADAM.) It will will work with current and former regulators to provide rules for the efficient trading, custody, clearing and settlement of digital assets, according to the announcement. ADAM’s Code of Conduct will include guidelines for market integrity, risk management, KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti-money laundering), custody, record keeping, clearing and settlement, market manipulation, data protection, and research, among other topics.",434.9500000000003,1

Two individuals familiar with the Bitcoin project told Benjamin Bain, a reporter at Bloomberg, that despite the downturned market the index still plans on offering these contracts. Bitcoin (BTC) has plunged nearly -75% since the beginning of the year and interest in digital currencies has dramatically decreased. Still, the Wall Street exchange feels there is enough investor interest to continue its plans. One of the individuals at Nasdaq told Bloomberg that the company has been working diligently to satisfy the concerns of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission before launch. The first Bitcoin futures were launched mid-December 2017 by the CME Group Inc. and CBOE Global Markets Inc. Bitcoin (BTC) saw its record high of nearly $20,000 a coin after the first set of Bitcoin futures were launched. At press time, BTC is currently trading at just over $3,700. In December, many thought that these future contracts would usher in a new wave of investment from Wall Street investors, but the fall of digital currencies in 2018 proves that wasn’t the case. >> Bitcoin Cash Hash War: Who Won? Nasdaq hopes to launch its Bitcoin futures in Q1 2019. The futures offered in January will be based off Bitcoin’s price on numerous spot exchanges, said Nasdaq.com CEO Adena Friedman. The figures will be compiled by VenEck Associates Corp. The CME uses prices from four different markets, while the CBOE uses just one. Nasdaq isn’t the only impending Bitcoin derivative though. The New York Stock Exchange owner, Intercontinental Exchange Inc., plans on launching its contracts in late January 2019. There has yet to be an official announcement from Nasdaq Inc., and the reports published by Bloomberg seem to be from unofficial sources.

BitPay published an advisory saying Copay versions 5.0.2 through 5.1.0 were affected by the malicious code and that users with these versions installed should avoid running or opening the app until they install Copay version 5.2.0. “Our team is continuing to investigate this issue and the extent of the vulnerability,” the official announcement reads. “Currently, we have only confirmed that the malicious code was deployed on versions 5.0.2 through 5.1.0 of our Copay and BitPay apps. However, the BitPay app was not vulnerable to the malicious code. We are still investigating whether this code vulnerability was ever exploited against Copay users.” Copay, the affected wallet, has more than 100,000 downloads of Android, while the number of users from other platforms like iOS or Windows is unknown. Any other wallets using this module might be affected as well, although as of the time of writing, none of them have come forward.  The problem stems from a GitHub user volunteering to take over the library in question, inject malware and patch it up to avoid detection. The user, known only as “right9ctrl,” took over maintenance of the module from its original creator, developer Dominic Tarr, who said that he had not maintained the repository in years. In short, the developer updated the module with malware and then hid it from view, but the numerous people who had already installed it remain affected. Well known developer Jameson Lopp explained:  The npm ""event-stream"" repository has been compromised; if you are using it in a project along with ""copay-dash"" then the malware will steal any private keys it can find. https://t.co/fAnH6ik1n9 ___
Jackson Palmer, an Australian entrepreneur and technologist best known for creating the infamously successful ""joke"" cryptocurrency Dogecoin, added: This is one of the major issues with JavaScript-based cryptocurrency wallets with heavy up-stream dependencies coming from NPM. @BitPay essentially trusted all the up-stream developers to never inject malicious code into their wallet.@dominictarr also let the attacker in, sadly Event-stream is downloaded roughly two million times a week by application programmers for many different uses. The version with the malware in it, Event-Stream v 3.3.6, was published on September 9 via Node Package Manager (NPM) repository, and had since been downloaded by nearly 8 million application programmers.

BTC/USD corrected above USD 4,000 and USD 4,100, but it struggled to clear the USD 4,200 barrier. Later, the price declined again and settled below USD 4,000, which is a bearish sign. Similarly, ethereum price failed to break an important resistance near USD 120 and started a fresh downward move. Ripple price also struggled to gain traction above USD 0.400, resulting in bearish moves. Going forward, if bitcoin and altcoins struggle to break key pivot levels, there could be yet another bearish wave below recent lows in the near term. Total market capitalization  Recently, there was a recovery above the USD 4,000 resistance in bitcoin price , but buyers struggled to retain strength. BTC/USD topped near the USD 4,200 level and started a fresh downward move. It broke the USD 4,000 and USD 3,800 levels to move back in a bearish zone.
The price is down around 6% (UTC 08:30 AM) and it seems like it could decline further below the USD 3,750 and USD 3,620 support levels. In the worst case scenario, the price may even break the recent low and trade below the USD 3,500 level. Ethereum price  recovered more than USD 15, but it struggled near a crucial resistance at USD 120. ETH/USD faced a solid selling interest near USD 120, which resulted in a bearish reaction.
The price declined below USD 115 and USD 110 and it is currently down around 6%. An immediate support is at USD 105, below which there is a risk of a downside break below the key USD 100 support. The main resistances on the upside are at USD 115 and USD 120. Bitcoin cash  ABC rallied above the USD 200 and USD 220 resistance levels. However, BCHABC failed to stay above USD 200 and later declined heavily. The price is currently trading near USD 180 and it seems like it could test the USD 170 support. On the other hand, BCHSV rallied above the USD 100 level and traded as high as USD 140. It is currently consolidating above USD 100 with positive moves.
Ripple price  recovered above the USD 0.385 resistance, but it struggled to clear the USD 0.400 resistance. XRP/USD is down 5% to USD 0.358 and it could revisit the USD 0.340 support. Many small cap altcoins declined recently more than 10%, including SRN, FCT, MITH, STEEM, ONT, MAID, REP, WAN, GNT and ODE. Out of these, SRN declined around 26% and FCT is down nearly 25%. Overall, bitcoin price is back below the key USD 4,000 support, which is a bearish sign. If BTC/USD fails to jump above USD 4,000 and USD 4,200, there is a risk of more losses below the USD 3,500 level in the near term. Similarly, there could be an increase in selling pressure on altcoins like ethereum, ripple, BCH, neo and litecoin if they fail to start a fresh rebound in the next few hours.

However, some experts in both countries believe that fresh opportunities may well arise following the market panic. Some are sensing a possible upside, and are choosing to stay in the game. Chinese media outlet Caixin quotes the COO of Chinese company Mining Sea, which operates farms in Yunnan, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia as stating, “We have yet to switch off our machines as we also offer financial products to help clients control for such risks.” The COO also stated miners could possibly “acquire more coins” now as rivals “have temporarily stopped running their machines.” And Russian media outlet Kommersant quotes the co-founder of the ICG cryptocurrency fund as stating that although “the Russian home miner is gradually disappearing,” big businesses in the country are ready to step in with superior technology – perhaps leading to a second boom in mining. However, for many it's still a challenging period and bitcoin miners are increasingly feeling the pressure to sell their coins.  Caixin quotes a mining industry insider as stating that some miners in the country have “halted operations” as Bitcoin prices have dropped below “shutdown price,” the level below which mining effectively ceases to be profitable. F2pool, one of the largest mining pools in China, stated that Bitcoin prices had dropped below shutdown price for miners paying USD 0.05/KwH for electricity and using Bitmain’s Antminer S7, Avalon’s Miner A741 and the lower-frequency version of the USED Whatsminer M3+. F2pool officials  also claimed, earlier this week, that between 600,000 and 800,000 Bitcoin miners have pulled the plug on their operations in the past two weeks. Meanwhile, in Russia, Kommersant quotes the co-founder of mining farm operator and hardware maker RMC as stating mining farm facilities had “temporarily suspended activities at the request of project participants, as the cost of electricity currently exceeds the income made from mining.” The company says it will push ahead, however, with plans to build parts for new altcoin mining hardware. Marketplace app Youla, Russia’s answer to eBay, has reported a 25% rise in the amount of mining equipment listings, as well as “a simultaneous drop” in bid prices, for both ready-made mining rigs and video cards. Youla noted that the terms “mining” and “Bitcoin” were now being searched for four times less often than at the beginning of the year – when Russia was in the grip of its mining boom.

Over the past 24 hours (UTC 07:10 AM), bitcoin has shot up more than 8% from its weekend lows below the USD 3,500 level. From a technical analysis-perspective, bitcoin and other major coins now appear to have found some support around levels established all the way back in September 2017. The question, however, is whether this level will hold, or if the market needs to search even lower to find a bottom.

Among the biggest losers during the recent wave of crypto selling has been Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which was hit hard by the internal fighting between the Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV camps. The dust in that battle now seems to have settled with Bitcoin ABC emerging as the winner, but it has nonetheless caused heavy losses in the BCH price, as it fell from over USD 380 a week ago to just USD 167 as of press time. Bitcoin Cash also briefly lost its number 4 spot to EOS, although this has been reversed Monday morning. Although the market seems to have found at least some support for now, volatility may be coming back to bitcoin soon. On Friday (Nov 30), bitcoin futures on the CME Group exchange are set to expire – a monthly occasion which some suggest have caused bitcoin sell-offs in the past. However, the link between bitcoin futures expiries and sell-offs – or rallies – in the “physical” bitcoin market is highly uncertain, and the last year has shown that other futures expiry dates have been rather uneventful in the bitcoin market.",-235.94000000000005,0

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, treasurer Josh Mandel explained that as of November 26 companies throughout the state could register and pay for a whole range of taxes via the OhioCrypto platform, using Bitcoin. The treasurer is quoted as stating, “I see [Bitcoin] as a legitimate form of currency.” Per the Wall Street Journal’s report, the state’s platform also hopes to begin accepting other cryptocurrencies, and hopes to allow “eventually” individuals in Ohio to pay taxes using the platform. A number of other American states have launched similar bids, including Illinois, Arizona and Georgia, but none have yet succeeded in persuading local legislatures to accept proposals. The OhioCrypto platform appears to be the brainchild of BitPay, an Atlanta-based third-party blockchain payment service. For its part, BitPay appears to be optimistic about the future of Bitcoin, despite massive price drops in recent days. Meanwhile, BitPay's chief operating officer Sonny Singh last week told Bloomberg he was confident that Bitcoin prices would bounce back in 2019, hitting all-time highs. Singh stated, “By the end of Q1 or Q2, Bitcoin will emerge as a viable commodity.” He also said that an influx of “new players and miners engaging in the industry” would help drive a new price surge. Meanwhile, a museum in the state has also begun allowing cryptocurrency payments. As of earlier this month, visitors to the Great Lakes Science Center in Cleveland can pay for admission in Bitcoin.

Many executives in the major global banks shot down digital currencies almost immediately, as Bitcoin was a direct threat to their existence. See, Bitcoin was created to expose the currently flawed central banking system and to completely revamp the way individuals spend and send money. It remains unknown why crypto began to pick up speed towards the second half of 2017, but at the time, some digital currencies were seeing 100% gains in a single day. Cryptocurrency mining began to pick up as well, which became an extremely lucrative business at the time. Many businesses began completely changing their business models and centering them around digital token mining. Unfortunately, the equipment to ‘mine’ isn’t cheap. The process of generating new units of cryptocurrency by solving complex puzzles can often be expensive, due to the vast amounts of electricity that is needed. This doesn’t even include the hardware required. In January of 2018, no one predicted the fall of BTC and the rest of the crypto market. In 30 days, $500 billion was wiped off of the market. So, when Bitcoin’s price dropped, BTC mining was no longer economically viable. So what happens to those businesses that invested all that money into mining equipment and state-of-the-art mining facilities? Well, they run out of money. So far, the biggest casualty from the fall of digital currencies comes from the US-based mining firm Giga Watt. The company was forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after it was unable to pay its debts of around $7 million USD. >> Bitcoin’s Fall from Grace: Warren Buffett Said It All Along A large number of the world’s mining operations reside in China, and countless mining businesses have been forced to shut their doors.

It seemed to be holding steady at around $6,300/$6,400 for most of October, but now it’s holding on for dear life. Mid-November saw the coin drop unprecedentedly. It began crashing and continues to today. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is priced at $4,2oo per coin and down a further 4% on the day. Some will blame Bitcoin Cash’s hard fork for creating an industry scare. Some will blame talk of regulatory scrutiny for rattling investors. But others will say, “I told you so” that Bitcoin’s crash was an inevitable eventuality and neither of the above possibilities could ever be a real reason for its fall. One such skeptic is Warren Buffett, who never bit the cryptocurrency line. He has continually spoken out against digital assets, maintaining “almost with certainty, that they will come to a bad ending.” Many people have lauded his type for his ‘outdated’ thinking; the world’s wealthiest investor who made his fortune playing the stock market was always going to dismiss cryptocurrency. Of course he was. But weren’t his concerns even partly founded? Bitcoin price has been decided by market speculation. It’s that simple really. And, for some, ‘speculation,’ means a mixed bag of exaggerations, lies, ideologies, and empty promises. It was this speculation that drove the market mania of last year. It was in 2017 that Bitcoin surged to the heights of almost $20,000 USD per coin. But like everything in this world, hype is usually met with an inevitable fall from grace. >> Colorado ICOs: Regulators Stop Another 18 ICOs Isn’t that really what Bitcoin is? A new technology that was hyped up to ‘replace’ the unfair and dated practices of our modern financial sector? If you were lucky enough to get in early before the hype, then you may have made yourself a pretty penny off of it. For everyone else, the idea of simply getting rich off of Bitcoin is nothing but a fantasy. The idea that any kind of financial platform couldn’t come with corruption and controversy is a pipe dream. So was Warren Buffett always right? Is this the beginning of the “bad end” for cryptocurrencies? Where Bitcoin goes, others tend to follow, and as it stands, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has fallen to around $138.6 billion since January 2018. This is a remarkable fall of 80%. Even more remarkable is that figure translates to almost $700 billion USD.

At USD 4,300, bitcoin is now at the lowest level seen since October 2017. Value of created bitcoins: ""Pretty concerning for small-time miners like me... Thankfully, I get extremely cheap power but it's hard to compete with economies of scale when some miners can buy hundreds of ASICs at a time,"" Reddit user PragmaticPleb wrote in a thread. ""I’m still running but the margins are thin and I might have to come out of pocket to cover some costs if the price drops even more. We’ll just have to do our best to weather this bear market and hopefully we can come out on the other side when the price begins to recover,"" IGotThisYo replied. Some large mining firms are already throwing in the towel. On Wednesday, it was reported that US-based mining form Giga Watt had filed for bankruptcy in Washington, still owing creditors nearly USD 7 million. According to another article by the South China Morning Post on Thursday, the China-based mining pool F2Pool now estimates that a range of mining machines, including the Antminer S7, S9, and AvalonMiner 741, has now become unprofitable to operate in China, leading to a flood of these machines being put up for sale on the second-hand market. Some, however, see opportunities when others are suffering. According to the same article, a miner by the name Jack Liao of the Shenzhen, China-based bitcoin mining firm Lightning Asic, has taken advantage of the slump to buy up second-hand mining machines at bargain prices. Liao told the newspaper that he has bought up about 50,000 mining machines, most of which are Antminer S9s, for about USD 70 each. A new S9 machine goes for around USD 300 from Bitmain’s website. Moreover, according to Nikkei, China's Bitmain Technologies Holding and Ebang International Holding, the two largest bitcoin mining equipment makers in the world, are widely expected to follow peers in delaying planned floats on the Hong Kong stock market, analysts warn, as regulatory headwinds and market volatility have disrupted plans by crypto-related companies to sell shares. As WhalePanda, an angel investor and bitcoin enthusiast, posted to Twitter, the losses that miners have suffered are already visible on the bitcoin hash rate: It will become easier to mine Bitcoin which of course benefits the miners who don't have to sell immediately since they can more easily stock up on $BTC and just wait out the bear market. Not every miner can do this though since (electricity) bills need to get paid. pic.twitter.com/t8ui3vznlP As a result, the difficulty rate of bitcoin mining has also begun to decline as more and more miners are switching off their machines. The difficulty has already declined two times this year, and it is likely that the next adjustment will bring the difficulty rate even lower. Moreover, it looks like the Bitcoin blockchain is also adding blocks at a slower rate than usual. Another casualty of the bear market: Bitcoin's inter-blocktime is actually getting longer. As hashpower comes offline, difficulty isn't reducing fast enough to cope, and Bitcoin is adding blocks at a slower rate than usual.https://t.co/IuY5cLP5zp pic.twitter.com/WPIg1sTkTR Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at online crypto and foreign exchange brokerage eToro, echoed the same sentiment, saying “miners are shutting down their rigs.” Bitcoin hashrate is now the lowest it's been since August. It's still up sharply since the start of the year but it seems clear that some miners are shutting down their rigs in face of lower BTC prices. pic.twitter.com/Og9AJM6FGt And since today is “Black Friday,” more or less desperate cloud mining companies, including the well-known Genesis Mining, are trying to push their mining contracts to new customers at discounted prices.

The initiative affects 24,000 tobacco shops in the country where bitcoins will be offered as vouchers, which can be cashed in via Keplerk’s wallet. The company will take a 7% cut on every transaction as commission fees. “Tobacco shop owners are the best channel as they are trusted by customers, and they are used to sell vouchers such as credit for mobile phones,” Adil Zakhar, Keplerk’s director for strategy and development, was quoted as saying by Reuters. According to the Bank of France, the monetary authority will not supervise Keplerk’s project, but the institution has warned French citizens about the risks of buying cryptocurrencies. “Those are purely speculative assets and not currencies. Those who invest in bitcoin or other crypto-assets do it at their own risk,” the central bank said on November 21, 2018.

BTC/USD rebounded a few points, but it struggled to break the USD 4,750 and USD 4,800 resistance levels. Similarly, there was a minor upside correction in ethereum price above the USD 130 and USD 132 levels. However, buyers failed to push the price above the USD 140 and 145 resistance levels. The current price action is positive and it seems like major cryptocurrencies could consolidate above supports in the short term before the next move.  Total market capitalization  There was a decent upward move above the USD 4,600 level in bitcoin price . BTC/USD even traded above the USD 4,700 level. However, the price failed to surpass the USD 4,750 and USD 4,800 resistance levels. It is currently consolidating near USD 4,600 with a few positive moves.
On the downside, a break below USD 4,600 may push the price towards the USD 4,500 support area. The main support for the current wave is near USD 4,400, which is the lower end of the range. On the upside, a successful break above USD 4,750 and USD 4,800 is needed for buyers to gain bullish momentum in the near term. Ethereum price  managed to move above the USD 130 and USD 132 resistance levels. ETH/USD also traded above the USD 135 level, but it faced a strong resistance near the USD 140 - USD 142 area.
The price is currently trading in a range above the USD 132 level, below which the price could drop back towards the USD 125 support. On the upside, a successful break above USD 142 and USD 150 is needed for more gains. Bitcoin cash  ABC failed to stay above the USD 250 support and declined more than 4%. BCHABC is currently trading near USD 230, with an immediate support at USD 220. BCHSV declined sharply by more than 7% and traded below the USD 62 and 60 support levels. The next key support is at USD 55 and USD 50.
Ripple price  seems to be struggling to stay above the USD 0.450 and USD 0.460 levels. XRP/USD is down 2.2% and it could continue to correct lower towards the USD 0.435 support. A few small cap altcoins recovered between 8%-15% today, including NEXO, LRC, GNT, SNT, XIN, PIVX, MANA, REP and BAT. Out of these, NEXO climbed around 15% and LRC moved up close to 13%. To sum up, bitcoin price is trading with a short term positive bias above the USD 4,400 support. If BTC/USD manages to climb above the USD 4,750 and USD 4,800 resistance levels, there could be a decent rebound in the coming sessions. If not, there are chances of a fresh bearish wave in bitcoin and altcoins in the near term.

In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Sonny Singh, chief commercial officer of the major bitcoin payment service provider BitPay, said that the bitcoin price, in his view, will not do much at all until there is a new catalyst to drive the market either higher or lower. According to Singh, such a catalyst could be Fidelity launching its much-anticipated crypto product, or “Bakkt launching their product, or Square launching their product, or Blackrock launching an ETF […]” However, “until such products come out,” Singh explained, “I don’t think there is much of a market catalyst moving bitcoin either way.” In either case, according to him, “Bitpay will process over a billion dollars again this year, even though the price of bitcoin has dropped 75%, because people are actually using bitcoin, whether it is as a store of value, a payment transact…There’s just different use-cases for it all over the world.” In conclusion, Singh said that he expects the bitcoin price to trade somewhere around USD 15,000 to USD 20,000 by the end of next year, as long as some of the “traditional companies” mentioned do launch their products. However, he added a word of caution, saying that “nothing moves fast in fin-tech.” Watch the entire Bloomberg interview with BitPay’s chief commercial officer Sonny Singh below: In a separate interview on the Bloomberg Markets podcast on Wednesday, chairman of London-based crypto asset management company CoinShares, Danny Masters, shared his insights on the current state of the crypto market and the new trend of so-called stablecoins in particular. When asked about his opinion on stablecoins, Masters said that the idea of “switching from volatile crypto assets to stable dollars, while remaining within this electronic environment […] is quite appealing.” “It’s an interesting development,” he said, while adding that “certainly there is demand for that digital dollar.”  Asked about the recent sell-off in the crypto markets, Masters admitted that it has been difficult for his company, saying “it’s certainly been a challenging week in the bitcoin space.” However, he also pointed out that when global stock markets first started to become more volatile a month ago, “bitcoin remained stable.” In the current phase, “the bears in bitcoin have definitely scored a win,” Masters said, while adding that as someone who has been around for a while “one tries not to become too excited when it goes up, and not too disappointed when it goes down.” Meanwhile, Lou Kerner, partner at CryptoOracle, an advisory and investment firm, told CNBC that ""If you go back to the internet bubble, which is what a lot of us in crypto look at for direction, Amazon, arguably one of the greatest companies in the history of the mankind, was down over 95% over two years.""",-245.6300000000001,0

The Fundstrat Global Advisor voiced his prediction on CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ yesterday. Bitcoin just recently fell to its lowest levels in more than a year yesterday, but Lee remains convinced. Originally, Lee cut his Bitcoin year-end prediction by $10,000—from $25,000 to $15,000. “Days like this, it does make me wonder,” said Lee to CNBC. “These past few days have definitely been a negative development.” The Fundstrat advisor contends that more oversight from US regulators and institutional involvement could push the prices of BTC up. Lee told CNBC that the upcoming launch of Bakkt, the digital assets platform run by the New York Stock Exchange, could peak investor interest as it is set to launch at the end of January 2019. Often, digital currencies see a ‘boost’ during a run-up to a major product launch. >> Bakkt Looks for Support for Its Next Futures Contract Elaborating more on his US regulation comment, Lee explained: “Once we have that [regulatory clarity], I think, institutions will feel more comfortable in making bets.” Lee isn’t the only one that remains bullish on cryptocurrency. Just recently, the Netherlands-based KPMG released another bull report on cryptocurrency. From its peak in early January 2018, the total cryptocurrency market has fallen over $600 billion USD. Uneducated investors flooded the cryptocurrency market around Thanksgiving of last year when the market remained consistently green for nearly 6-8 weeks. Around Christmas, the market took a stagnant turn, only to hit its record peak in the first week of January. When the market corrected after its peak, new crypto investors began panic selling. Many educated investors know correction in any market is inevitable, but those new to investing did not. Thus, the widespread dump of cryptocurrencies.

Despite the importance of the Bakkt futures launch might be overestimated, the news trimmed Bitcoin’s gains yesterday.

Insiders knew before the rest of us.  I’m nvr selling btw! ____ This means they think we will hit bottom near end of January. ____ Whatever the reason for the delay may be, some speculate that it has more to do with low liquidity and little trading interest in the futures market, rather than “the volume of interest in Bakkt.” Speaking about the size of the bitcoin futures market back in August, Chris Concannon, president and chief operating officer of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) told Bloomberg: “I’ve learned that there’s been more articles than volume. It’s a little bit shocking to me the attention this market gets versus its size. The entire crypto market is a fifth of Apple.” CBOE and CME, an American financial market company operating an options and futures exchange, combined traded about 9,000 contracts a day in the third quarter, according to Bloomberg data. Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the University of Houston and an expert on futures trading, stressed in October that “Institutional players have stayed on the Bitcoin sidelines, and as long as they are, the futures contracts are likely not to generate substantial amounts of volume.”  Bakkt made a splash in the crypto world when it was first announced back in August, with the support of well-known brand names like Microsoft, BCG, and Starbucks. It was set up by the New York-based Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), and aims to offer 1-day physically settled bitcoin futures for institutional clients from its base in the US. Many in the crypto community have expressed great hopes that the company can help boost institutional interest in cryptocurrency, and possibly be a catalyst for the next wave of buying in the market. Now, according to the new update from Bakkt’s CEO Kelly Loeffler, the launch date of the institutional-grade trading and “warehousing” platform will be pushed back to January 24, 2019, from an originally scheduled release in December of this year. The new release date is still subject to regulatory approvals, and the company promises to keep the community updated on progress and relevant milestones as the launch approaches. “Given the volume of interest in Bakkt and work required to get all of the pieces in place, we will now be targeting January 24, 2019 for our launch to ensure that our participants are ready to trade on Day 1,” Loeffler wrote in the statement. Whether the recent market crash has something to do with Bakkt is currently one of the popular topics in the community, and many are joking that traditional investors want to “buy the dip.” “When retail investors miss the train, they miss the train. When institutions miss the train, they bring the train back,” Reddit user u/Subfolded quoted a Wall Street saying. This seems to be the general consensus: that the prices are being manipulated by whales that want institutional investors to enter the market below its real value. However, there is also a smaller group of people that just don’t see it: u/McDonald5 sarcastically writes, “Get your tin foil hat ready, it's a CONSPIRACY!” The first group, meanwhile, is the significantly louder one. “Bitcoin was very stable over the last few month but suddenly right before ETFs and BAKKT, everything drops. It’s only my opinion but a lot of money can enter with ETFs and a drop just doesn’t make sense. Normally we get pumps from news like this and dumps when it’s released. This time I feel like somebody is making sure opposite happens,” writes u/toohottoospicy.  u/Raymikqwer replies, “I feel like the majority of Reddit seems to think everything is conspiracy involving whales or some other nonsense. There’s always the possibility that everything was just MASSIVELY overbought in December/January and it’s still correcting to a price the market deems as fair.”",136.6300000000001,1

Since its all-time high in December 2017, bitcoin is now down nearly 77%, ether - 90%, ripple - 88%, litecoin - 91%, according to OnChainFX data.  Now, the price of the number one cryptocurrency, bitcoin, is down 15% over the past 24 hours.

Top 10 coins: (UTC 06:40 AM) The losses overnight follow a similar sell-off from Wednesday last week, when bitcoin also shredded off more than 10%. As has been the trend over the past few days, Ripple’s XRP has held up great in the sea of red numbers with a 24 hour decline of just below 1%. According to some commentators, Ripple may be getting some of its stability from being a very different cryptocurrency, as it aims to work within the current banking system rather than replacing it. 
UPDATED (UTC 09:20) Ripple price was stable earlier during the day, but later buyers gave up and sellers took control below the USD 0.460 support.  Another possible explanation is that the drama following the Bitcoin Cash split has affected the rest of the crypto space, and in particular other proof-of-work-based assets like bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash was one of the hardest-hit coins last night, falling more than 40%. As the crypto market hits rock bottom once again, some still see opportunities in the space. According to Spencer Bogart, partner at the crypto-focused investment firm Blockchain Capital, there is still a “gigantic” opportunity in the crypto space, and in particular in projects that are related to bitcoin, or “programmable money,” as Bogart calls it. “I still believe that programmable money in a multi-trillion-dollar idea. Right now, we’re in a bear market, but we’re coming off one of the biggest bull markets of all time,” Bogart told Bloomberg on Monday. Meanwhile, Stephen Palley, Anderson Kill partner, reacts to Bitcoin tumbling below the USD 5,000 mark by saying he doesn't see a connection or causal relationship between recent SEC (The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) activity and the price of cryptocurrency.

I bet that question has been asked many times over in 2018. Bitcoin gained house-hold name status around Thanksgiving last year. That was the kind of year Bitcoin had in 2017. But now, Bitcoin is down more than 30% since Thanksgiving 2017. But that’s not as bad as being down 60% on the year, 18% this week alone, and hitting the lowest level of 2018 today. At the time of writing, BTC is selling for $5,148 and is down nearly 9% on the day. As is the industry standard, Bitcoin tends to lead the pack; other major cryptocurrencies are down, with Ethereum and Ripple losing over 12% and 4.5% respectively. In fact, this loss is so significant for Ethereum that Ripple has just overtaken it in terms of market cap. Now Ripple is the second most valuable cryptocurrency in the world. Ethereum is third. All in a week’s work. Bitcoin’s lowest level came unexpectedly—BTC had remained around the $6,400 range for most of October despite the rest of the global markets going through sell-offs. It was around this time last year when Bitcoin began its epic rise, first topping $10,000 at the end of November and was worth almost $20,000 per coin by Christmas. The CBOE brought in the first Bitcoin futures trading platform on December 10th, but prices hit their peak the same day the CME began Bitcoin futures trading on December 17th. The futures market gave investors the ability to bet on the decline of Bitcoin price. It was the ultimate gambling platform—Bitcoin, with a value derived from speculation and nothing tangible, could now make investors even more money by betting on, effectively, market speculation. >> IDEX Lists Ride Sharing Company RedCab LLC’s REDC Token But today paints a different story. This past week has wiped approximately $40 billion off the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization. According to eToro analyst Mati Greenspan: “The next logical level of support is at $5,000 but if that doesn’t hold, the next logical support level isn’t until $3,500. With all the falling prices lately, this definitely fits the definition of a buyers market.” But do you think anyone is expecting Bitcoin to really kick off again? Do you think if you bought in now that the coin might repeat the good old days of 2017? Something tells me betting on its decline these days makes for an easier prediction.

According to Lee, the level at which mining costs match the trading price is down to USD 7,000 from an earlier estimate of USD 8,000 for the S9 mining machine by Bitmain, CNBC reported last Friday. The head of Fundstrat Global Advisors, a market analyst company, estimates that fair value for bitcoin would be roughly 2.2 times the new USD 7,000 break-even price, therefore Bitcoin should stand at around USD 15,000. Less than a month ago, he was convinced that Bitcoin could still surpass USD 20,000 - even in spite of the almost year-long bear market.  Bitcoin price chart: The analyst also stressed that the recent drop in the market led to a renewed wave of pessimism: “We believe the negative swing in sentiment is much worse than the fundamental implications”. However, according to Lee, a price recovery is possible. He believes that the wave of institutions (Bakkt, Fidelity) - that are expected to enter the market at the end of 2018 - could bring Bitcoin bulls back.  Meanwhile, Sven Henrich, founder of NorthmanTrader, a market analysis firm, published this chart that compares Lee's predictions and Bitcoin price: (Click on Henrich's tweet to see the whole chart below.) Henrich’s followers on Twitter reacted:  Year end $15k???? That’s almost a triple in 6 weeks. Other members of the cryptoverse have also offered their opinion:  pic.twitter.com/36BKDs8C8e Back in 2017, Lee stated that he believes “Bitcoin is your best investment until the end of the year.” According to him, people see Bitcoin as the older generations have been seeing gold in the 1980s: a hedge against fiat currencies. If Bitcoin captures the ""5% of just the gold market, it's USD 25,000. But 5% seems like an awfully small number. Let's say it's 10 or 15. Then bitcoin could easily be in the USD 100,000 range,” he said back then.",-749.29,0

BTC/USD remained in a bearish zone and opened with a negative tone this week. The price recently broke the USD 5,500 support and traded to a new 2018 low. Similarly, ethereum was under a lot of selling pressure as it broke the USD 175 support. It is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) down more than 10% and it seems like sellers are in control below USD 160. Both BCHABC and BCHSV declined heavily below the USD 250 and USD 100 supports respectively. The current market sentiment is clearly bearish and it seems like bitcoin could extend declines towards USD 5,000 in the coming sessions. Total market capitalization  There were heavy bearish moves below the USD 5,600 level in bitcoin price . BTC/USD traded below the USD 5,550 and USD 5,400 support levels recently to move further into a bearish zone. A new 2018 high was formed near USD 5,300 and it seems like the price could continue to move down in the near term.
The main weekly support level is at USD 5,000, below which there is an open space up to USD 4,400. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 5,500, above which the price could recover towards the USD 5,750 level. The key weekly resistance is at USD 6,000, which was a crucial support earlier. Ethereum price  fell during the past few hours and declined below the USD 170 and USD 160 support levels. ETH/USD is currently down around 13% to USD 155.
An immediate support is at USD 150, below which the price could tumble towards the USD 130 level. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 170, above which the price could test USD 180. The main weekly hurdle for buyers is near the USD 195 level. Both Bitcoin cash  coins are down significantly. BCHABC is down around 15% and it recently traded below the USD 250 support. The next major support for buyers is near the USD 200 level. BCHSV collapsed and declined roughly 30% to USD 90. If it continues to decline, it could test the USD 80 level in the near term.
Ripple price  recovered recently, but buyers failed to hold gains above the USD 0.520 and USD 0.505 levels. XRP/USD followed bitcoin’s path and declined around 5%. It is currently trading near USD 0.475 and it could test the USD 0.450 level. Many altcoins declined heavily and registered losses between 15%-20%, including LRC, ICX, WAN, AION, ELF, SRN, VET, IOST and MKR. Out of these, LRC is down 18% and ICX declined 17%. To sum up, bitcoin and altcoins moved further into the red zone. BTC/USD may perhaps continue to decline towards USD 5,000 and if buyers fail to defend more losses, the price could tumble. Similarly, ethereum must stay above the USD 150 level to avoid a drop towards the USD 130 and USD 125 levels in the near future.

They define institutionalization as the at-scale participation in the cryptocurrency market of banks, broker dealers, exchanges, payment providers, fintech companies, and other entities in the global financial services ecosystem. ""New tokens and assets are one thing, but new business models and market participants may redefine the space significantly over the next few years,"" according to KPMG. For Bitcoin and other assets to “truly become a currency,” KPMG believes that there will be three criteria to be met: being used as a unit of account, a store of value, and a unit of exchange. While it may meet the requirement of a “unit of account” to a certain extent, KPMG chief economist Constance Hunter believes that the assets are too unstable to be considered a store of value. “Consider for a moment extending a person or entity a loan in a cryptocurrency. The value is too unstable at the moment to be assured repayment. Under these conditions, neither lenders nor borrowers would be willing to take the risk of transacting in cryptocurrencies,” she explains. As for the final qualification - unit of exchange - Hunter adds, “In order to be a medium of exchange, a crypto must be a store of value. In order to be a store of value, the speculative nature of crypto must dissipate. Until at least one crypto meets all three criteria, they cannot be considered full currencies.” But once cryptocurrencies meet all three of these criteria, the financial world as we know it might well change. “If a crypto could achieve enough stability of value to be used for this purpose, it could eliminate the need to have bank accounts in multiple countries and could allow individuals to transfer money to anyone without paying wire fees. If a fully equipped crypto that has a stable value becomes easier and less expensive to transact than a government-issued fiat currency, it could be an innovation that becomes ubiquitous in the global financial services system,” Hunter believes. However, up until now, companies that have looked towards institutionalization have often faced immediate backlash from the community. One example is peer-to-peer crypto trading platform ShapeShift, which has announced mandatory KYC (know your customer) to be implemented very soon - to the disgruntlement of Bitcoin maximalists, who believed that this platform was one of the few remaining ones following “Satoshi’s vision.” Another recent example are stablecoins which have backdoors to allow them to freeze assets and blacklist addresses at will. Whether these companies will truly achieve mass adoption thanks to institutionalization still remains to be seen.",-69.76999999999953,0

They have recently revealed that their proprietary investment portfolio has recorded year-to-date returns of 77% against the highly bearish market. Talking on Bloomberg Daybreak Asia, Jehan Chu said, “I bought my first Bitcoin at USD 900 back in late 2013, and I continued buying all the way down to USD 200. Those of us who have been early in the space have seen this before, so do I think that USD 5,500 down from a high from around USD 18,000-19,000 is a good entry point? I do. [...] As we move forward, Bitcoin and some of the larger cap cryptocurrencies will increasingly be seen as a legitimate store of value, especially in the wake of what’s happening across the globe. And I think that USD 5,500 in a year will be seen as a very cheap price.” Forecasts coming from companies that have managed to record high returns might be worth to listen, especially given that the whole market is down around 65% compared to December 2017. (In either case, it's a healthy thing to take all forecasts with a grain of salt. For example, in December 2017, even Jehan Chu estimated that Bitcoin will reach USD 50,000 by the end of 2018 and confirmed this forecast in January.)  The return of 77% is recorded as of October 31st, with two more months until the end of the year. Kenetic Capital CEO Daniel Weinberg explains, “During this volatile period, our proprietary investment portfolio continued to outperform many crypto funds as a result of our deep institutional investment experience and strong risk management.” As to whether Bitcoin can go back to where it was around a year ago, Chu says, “I think we will see a significant turnaround, both in the blockchain space, as well as in the indicative prices of major assets including Bitcoin, Ethereum and other major large-cap cryptocurrencies [...] This past year we saw ICE, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, launch Bakkt in conjunction with Microsoft and Starbucks. So we’re really seeing these blue chip brands entering the space. And I think that’s having a positive overall effect on the enthusiasm and the comfort of the asset.” His opinion on entry points for Bitcoin is shared with some others, notably Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, an insurance giant. Around two months ago, El-Erian said that bitcoin is best bought at USD 5,000 - a reiteration of his previous stance from June. However, El-Erian “doesn't expect it will get all the way back to USD 20,000.” However, some market analysts still do not rule out that the market might continue falling.

BTC/USD failed to hold the USD 5,600 support and extended declines. The price tested the USD 5,400 level and later staged a decent recovery. Similarly, ethereum price recovered above the USD 175 level, but it is struggling to surpass the USD 185 and USD 190 resistance levels. Ripple price performed well as it recovered above USD 0.460, but it is facing a solid resistance near USD 0.475 and USD 0.480. Bitcoin cash hard forked recently into BCHABC and BCHSV. On Binance, Bitcoin Cash ABC traded towards USD 350 and it is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) trading near USD 300. Bitcoin Cash SV traded as high as USD 150 and it is currently trading near USD 130. Total market capitalization  After a short term correction, bitcoin price  traded below the USD 5,600 swing low. BTC/USD declined around USD 200 and tested the USD 5,400 support area where buyers emerged. The price recovered and traded above the USD 5,550 and USD 5,600 levels.
However, sellers defended the USD 5,750 resistance, which is a significant pivot region. To rebound further, the price must break the USD 5,750 and USD 5,800 resistance levels. If not, the price may perhaps decline back towards the USD 5,400 level. Ethereum price  traded below the USD 175 support recently and tested the USD 170 level. Later, ETH/USD recovered above USD 170 and USD 175, but the price faced a strong resistance near USD 185.
The price is currently down around 1.5% to USD 180 and it seems like it could revisit the USD 175 level. If sellers remain in action, the price is likely to surpass the USD 170 support in the near term. Bitcoin cash  ABC clearly dominated as its price traded as high as USD 350. BCHABC/USD is currently trading near USD 300 and it seems like it could move higher towards USD 320 and USD 330 in the near term. On the other hand, BCHSV/USD is trading near the USD 130 level, with an immediate support at USD 120 and resistance at USD 150.
Ripple price  moved with a bullish angle recently and recovered above the USD 0.450 and USD 0.460 resistance levels. However, XRP/USD must surpass the USD 0.480 resistance to climb higher in the near term. A few small cap altcoins recovered between 5%-7% recently, including MONA, WAX, DOGE, BAT, GXS, ZRX, MCO, DGB, ZEN and XLM.
Overall, the recent recovery in bitcoin above USD 5,600 is facing many hurdles near USD 5,750 and USD 5,800. Therefore, there is a risk of more declines towards USD 5,400 or USD 5,200 in the coming sessions. Similarly, ethereum could decline below USD 170 if buyers fail to take control above USD 185 in the short term.

BTC/USD declined sharply below the range support and traded below many crucial support such as USD 6,000, USD 5,800 and USD 5,600. Similarly, almost all major altcoins declined heavily, including ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin, EOS, NEO and ADA. The current (UTC 08:30 AM) technical structure suggests that bitcoin moved into a medium term downtrend below USD 6,000 and the current year decline could extend further if buyers fail to protect losses below USD 5,500 and USD 5,000. Read more about the recent market crash here. Total market capitalization  There was a sharp downside reaction after bitcoin price  broke the USD 6,000 support. BTC/USD declined more than 10% and traded at a new 2018 low around USD 5,600. Later, the price started a short term recovery, but buyers are likely to struggle near the USD 5,750 and USD 5,800 resistance levels. 
More importantly, the previous major support at USD 6,000 will most likely act as a strong hurdle for buyers in the near term. Therefore, an upside correction is likely to be limited unless buyers push the price back above USD 6,000. Ethereum price  traded below the USD 200 support and declined around 12%. ETH/USD traded close to the USD 170 level and it is currently consolidating losses.
An initial resistance on the upside is at USD 180, above which the price may perhaps test the USD 190 zone. The main resistance is near USD 195 - USD 200, which was a support earlier. On the downside, a break below USD 170 might push the price towards USD 155. Bitcoin cash price  tumbled more than 15% from the USD 500 swing high and traded close to the USD 400 support area. BCH/USD is currently consolidating near USD 420 with a bearish angle. On the upside, the price is likely to face a strong selling interest near the USD 440 - USD 450 zone. The main support is at USD 400, below which the price may possibly accelerate towards USD 360.
Ripple price  fell sharply below the USD 0.500 support and traded close to the USD 0.420 support. XRP/USD recovered later and it is currently facing resistance near the USD 0.460 and USD 0.470 levels. Many small cap altcoins tumbled by around 15% recently, including RVN, IOST, HC, ARK, STRAT, AION, CMT, WTC, LRC, ELF, NEXO, MKR, PPT, ZIL, ETN and LISK. To sum up, the recent collapse in bitcoin price below USD 6,000 might indicate that this year’s decline is not over yet. BTC/USD and major altcoins may perhaps continue to bleed and there could be more losses. The main support for bitcoin buyers for the current wave is USD 5,000, below which the price might decline towards the USD 4,200 support in the medium term.

On Thursday morning (UTC 05:50 AM), out of top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization only three are in green. Two of them - stablecoins. What is going on? What possible reasons for the sell-off are and what the market might expect? Let's dive in.  The price of bitcoin fell sharply Wednesday night and early Thursday morning, breaking the pattern of extremely low volatility seen over the past weeks and months. The technical support area formed by bitcoin’s previous low from late June was not enough to keep bitcoin prices from falling, and the sell-off did not stop until price reached USD 5,281 on Coinbase. The sell-off in bitcoin over the past 24 hours adds up to 11.2% on average across exchanges, data from CoinMarketCap shows. Data from the same source also reveals that bitcoin’s market capitalization has now fallen below USD 100 billion for the first time since October 2017, while the value of the entire cryptocurrency market has fallen from nearly 210 billion 24 hours ago to 184.2 billion as of press time. Top 10 coins by market capitalization in the past 24 hours: It’s still early to tell for sure what the reasons behind the most recent sell-off are, but some speculate that volatility in the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) market caused by the controversial BCH hard fork may have affected the BTC market as well. Interestingly, the overnight crypto sell-off also brought Ethereum and Ripple's XRP closer to each other in their battle for the number two spot on the ranking of the most valuable digital assets. Following a 14% sell-off in the price of ether, XRP has now overtaken Ethereum’s traditional position as the second most valuable cryptocurrency by a margin of about USD 100 million. Among other major movers Thursday morning, BCH again stood out with a loss of 18% over the past 24 hours. The sell-off follows heightened tensions ahead of the upcoming BCH hard fork, where Bitcoin SV has really caught up with the more mainstream fork proposal Bitcoin ABC in pre-fork trading on the Poloniex exchange. Best performers among top 100 coins: ____ Worst performers among top 100 coins: _____ Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro, a social trading platform:
“Three main factors are contributing to today’s drop in Bitcoin price.  Marshall Hayner, Founder of Metal Pay, a blockchain-based payments and rewards company: 
“To put it plainly, today’s dip is likely indicative of the fact that the most recent round of crypto speculators are capitulating. Thanks to revised short-term expectations that call into question the idea of a bull run by the end of the year, many are likely taking their chips off the table. A key takeaway from this most recent decline is the continued need for crypto liquidity, which will likely be found in future stages of industry maturation, hopefully in the form of adoption by retail consumers in their day-to-day activities.” Donald Bullers, North American Representative for Elastos, a developer of an internet operating system:
“It’s safe to say that Bitcoin Cash’s upcoming hard fork was stirring uncertainty amongst crypto investors, and forecasters across crypto and traditional markets alike have predicted a prolonged bear market heading into 2019. Crypto investors have proven to be highly reactive to changes across the landscape, and this dip could be the most recent case study of that phenomenon.” Casey Kuhlman, CEO of Monax Industries, a blockchain and smart contract software technology company:
""Crypto price slumps can often create misconceptions about the future of our industry, but perhaps what is most important to remember during periods of volatility is that the underlying blockchain technology solves real-world problems across the real economy. Crypto prices may rise and fall for reasons that are difficult to identify, however, the blockchain industry will remain strong and continue to grow."" Rohit Kulkarni, Managing Director of Private Investment Research at SharesPost, an online platform that links investors with late-stage venture-backed companies and shareholders: 
“We believe that there are three likely catalysts that could result in a crypto market turnaround in the next six months: There is greater clarity from regulators which could embolden the market; A select group of blockchain startups that have completed token offerings in the past year finally announce innovative commercial products; As smart money and institutional capital keeps piling up, investors pull the trigger and call the bottom of the market.” Meanwhile, Meltem Demirors, Chief Strategy Officer at CoinShares, a crypto focused investment company, sees brighter future for Bitcoin, but suggests that smaller cryptocurrencies might be in trouble. _____",-88.11999999999989,0

Where Bitcoin goes, the rest of the market tends to follow, and indeed, the index shows us all the top-ten coins are experiencing double-digit losses. Currently, Bitcoin is down over 10% and has touched a low of $5,550 a coin. This price is the weakest the coin has been since October 2017 and also puts an end to what was the steadiest period the coin experienced in months. Bitcoin has been trading comfortably around the $6,400 range for the majority of Autumn and volatility was at an all-time low. The market is placing the blame on tomorrow’s Bitcoin Cash hard fork for the selloff across the exchanges today. As stated, the damage is widespread, and Bitcoin Cash itself is suffering the hardest, with losses just shy of 17%. Ethereum is down -13.5% and Litecoin is down -13.05%, but the entire top-ten are hurting. The Bitcoin Cash hard fork will result in a network being split into two different versions of Bitcoin Cash. One upgrade will follow the Roger Ver-favored Bitcoin Cash ABC protocol, and the other will follow Craig Wright’s preferred protocol, the Bitcoin Cash SV. According to Mati Greenspan of eToro: “Both Roger and Craig are advocating a different version of Bitcoin Cash […] The end result will most likely be a split in the network resulting in two different versions of Bitcoin Cash when both upgrades go into effect this Thursday.” >> Japenese Crypto Exchange Coincheck Resumes NEM (XEM) Trade Ten Months Later The entire cryptocurrency market capitalization dropped by $15 billion USD over 24 hours Wednesday.

BTC/USD extended losses and traded below the USD 6,400 support area. It seems like the price is closing in towards the lower end of the range support at USD 6,300 and USD 6,250 where buyers are likely to struggle. Similarly, ethereum price declined below the USD 208 support, opening the doors for a test of the USD 200 support area. Ripple price also started a downside correction below USD 0.520 and trimmed most its recent gains. Total market capitalization  There was yet another failure near the USD 6,450 resistance in bitcoin price . BTC/USD moved down and traded below the USD 6,400 support area. It seems like sellers are in control and they could even push the price towards the key support at USD 6,300. Further below, the USD 6,250 support is the last line of defense for buyers and represents the lower end of the range support.
If there is an upside correction, the price may struggle to clear the USD 6,420 and USD 6,450 resistance levels. The main resistance on the upside is near the USD 6,500 level. Ethereum price  broke the key support at USD 208 and declined further. ETH/USD is likely to extend declines towards the USD 200 - USD 202 support area where buyers are likely to emerge.
On the flip side, if there is an upside correction, the USD 210 level could prevent gains. The next key resistance for a larger upward move awaits near USD 215, above which the price could test USD 225. Bitcoin cash price  started consolidation above the USD 500 support area. BCH/USD could correct higher, but it is likely to face sellers near the USD 530 and USD 540 levels. Above both levels, the price may perhaps surpass the USD 550 level. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 505, below which the price possibly will break the USD 500 support.
Ripple price  started a downside correction and traded below the USD 0.520 and USD 0.515 levels. XRP/USD is about to reach the USD 0.505 support where it could find a strong buying interest. Many small cap altcoins declined more than 5% recently, including WAX, XEM, XIN, ARK, MITH, ZRX, BAT and HC. On the other hand, two altcoins, SRN and ETA gained 17% and 11% respectively. Overall, bitcoin price is at a risk of more losses below the USD 6,300 support if buyers fail to contain selling pressure. The main supports are USD 6,300 and USD 6,250, below which there could be heavy slides in the coming days. Similarly, ethereum is reaching the lower end of the range support near USD 202, below which the price may well extend its declines towards USD 180.

However, this time the scammers left empty-handed.  According to a screenshot, shared by the the Twitter user @B_u_r_t_o_n  “Google” had seemingly decided to do “the biggest crypto-giveaway in the world.” The only thing users would have to do to participate in the “giveaway” was to “verify” their address by sending between 0.1 and 2 BTC – worth between 630 and 12,500 USD – to a bitcoin address, and then wait to receive between 1 and 20 BTC back.  The only problem, however, is that naïve users will never get any bitcoin back, and the hackers will instead run away with all the bitcoin they receive. In this case, the fake tweet, which came from G Suite’s (Google's brand of cloud computing, productivity and collaboration tools) verified Twitter account, was deleted after about 15 minutes. Google confirmed the breach. “We removed the tweet and are investigating with Twitter now,” a spokesperson for Google told Business Insider. However, it seems that the attack was a total failure. A search of the scammer’s Bitcoin address reveals that the corresponding wallet did not receive any bitcoins.  In comparison, in case of Target, scammers received a total of 5.86342085 BTC – about USD 36,887 – from unsuspecting victims.  So-called crypto giveaway scams have become a big problem on Twitter, and the social networking giant appears unable to stop the practice from spreading. A popular strategy among scammer is to set up accounts that impersonate famous people, and then launch a giveaway from that account. Tesla founder Elon Musk has for a long time been a favorite target for Twitter impersonators who typically creates accounts with usernames similar to the real Elon Musk.  Recently, however, more scams have occurred by hackers taking over control of verified Twitter accounts from well-known people (including Pope Francis and the US president Donald Trump) and companies to make the scam more believable, and then use those to ask for bitcoin payments. According to Twitter spokesperson, ""scammers are constantly changing their methods and it’s our job to stay on top of their movements, observe their actions and work to stay one step ahead. In most cases, our enforcement teams are detecting fraudulent activity and taking it down before it’s reported.""",-612.8899999999994,0

BTC/USD declined below the USD 6,450 support and it is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) trading with a bearish angle. Similarly, ethereum faced a lot of offers near the USD 215 resistance, resulting in a downside reaction. On the other hand, ripple recovered recently and moved above the USD 0.515 and 0.520 resistance levels. Going forward, bitcoin must move above the USD 6,500 resistance. If not, there is a risk of a sharp bearish reaction towards USD 6,200 in the near term. Total market capitalization  There was an increase in selling pressure on bitcoin price  and it failed to surpass the USD 6,500 resistance. BTC/USD traded close to the USD 6,400 support and it is currently consolidating losses. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 6,475, above which buyers are likely to struggle near USD 6,500.
On the flip side, if sellers gain pace below the USD 6,400 support, the price could move down sharply towards the USD 6,250 and USD 6,200 support levels in the short term. Ethereum price  made an attempt to surpass the USD 215 resistance, but it failed. ETH/USD is currently trading near the USD 208 support with range moves.
If there is a downside break below USD 208 or USD 206, the price will most likely trade below the USD 200 support. To rebound, buyers need to push the price above the USD 215 and USD 218 resistance levels. Bitcoin cash price  tested the USD 500 support recently and later recovered a few points. However, BCH/USD is still down around 2% and it remains at a risk of more losses if there is a close below the USD 500 support. On the upside, a break above the USD 525 and USD 530 levels is required for a decent recovery.
Ripple price  outperformed other major cryptocurrencies and recovered around 4%. XRP/USD moved above the USD 0.520 resistance and it may continue to rise in the near term towards USD 0.535 or USD 0.540. Despite bearish moves in bitcoin and ethereum, a few small altcoins managed to climb higher by more than 10%, including XEM, LINK, XET and ETA. Out of these, XEM gained around 12% and LINK rallied nearly 13%. To sum up, the recent moves suggest weakness in bitcoin price below the USD 6,500 resistance. If BTC/USD continues to fail near USD 6,475 and USD 6,500, there could be a downward move. Having said that, there are many key supports near USD 6,400 and USD 6,300. Therefore, it won’t be easy for sellers to gain momentum below USD 6,400.

However, BTC/USD failed to stay above the USD 6,600 resistance and later started a major downward move. The price trimmed most gains and settled below the USD 6,500 support level. Similarly, ethereum price declined from well above USD 220 and it is currently above the USD 208 support level. More importantly, ripple price declined sharply and tested the USD 0.500 support. At the outset, it seems like bitcoin and major altcoins are under pressure and remain at a risk of a downside break. Total market capitalization  Recently, bitcoin price  moved below the USD 6,500 and USD 6,450 support levels. BTC/USD tested the USD 6,400 support and later recovered a few points. The price is currently consolidating around USD 6,450, with an immediate resistance at USD 6,500. 
The main weekly resistance is at USD 6,600, above which the price may move towards the USD 6,750 level. On the other hand, if buyers fail to push the price above USD 6,500 and USD 6,550, there could be more downsides. The key weekly support is at USD 6,400, below which the price will most likely slide towards the USD 6,200 support. Ethereum price  also trimmed most gains and declined below the USD 215 support. ETH/USD tested the USD 208 support level and it is currently consolidating losses.
On the upside, the price must move past USD 215 and USD 220 to start a new upward move. If not, there is a risk of a bearish break below the USD 208 and USD 206 supports. The main weekly support is at USD 200, below which the price could drop to USD 185. Bitcoin cash price  is down more than USD 100 from the last week’s high and it is currently trading just above the USD 500 support. If BCH/USD declined below the USD 500 support, sellers could take control and push the price towards the USD 450 support area. On the upside, resistances are seen near USD 540, USD 550 and USD 575.
Ripple price  traded below the USD 0.525 and 0.515 support levels to move into a bearish zone. However, XRP/USD is still above the USD 0.500 support and there are slight chances of a decent recovery in the near term. Many altcoins declined recently and registered losses more than 5% today, including XET, VERI, SC, BAT, RVN, IOST, revain, DOGE and ZEC. Out of these, XET is down around 11% and VERI fell roughly 8%. Overall, bitcoin price seems to be struggling to recover above USD 6,500. If BTC/USD continues to face selling pressure, there is a risk of a bearish break below the USD 6,420 and USD 6,400 support levels. Similarly, ethereum and ripple must recover above key resistances (USD 220 and USD 0.525 respectively) to avoid a sharp decline.

BTC/USD declined below USD 6,550 and recently tested a major support near USD 6,500, which protected further losses. Similarly, ethereum tested the USD 215 support and it is currently consolidating in a tight range. On the other hand, bitcoin cash and ripple declined a few more points and later managed to recover. The current market sentiment is neutral and it seems like there could be range moves in bitcoin and ethereum before the next move.  Total market capitalization  There was an extended downside correction below the USD 6,550 support in bitcoin price . BTC/USD declined and traded below the USD 6,525 level. The price tested the next major support at USD 6,500, which acted as a solid barrier for sellers.
At the moment, the price is slowly recovering, but the previous supports at USD 6,520 and USD 6,530 may perhaps act as resistances. The main resistance could be USD 6,550, above which the price will most likely revisit the USD 6,660 resistance. Ethereum price  traded below the USD 215 support recently, but later it managed to recover. ETH/USD is currently consolidating near USD 215 and it is preparing for the next move.
Buyers need to gain strength above the USD 220 and USD 225 levels to accelerate upsides. On the other hand, a break below the USD 215 support may push the price back towards the USD 210 support. Bitcoin cash price  extended slides and traded below the USD 630 and USD 600 support levels. BCH/USD traded close to the USD 570 support and later recovered. It is currently trading near USD 600, with an immediate resistance at USD 620 followed by USD 630. On the downside, the USD 580 and USD 570 levels are important supports.
Ripple price  declined sharply and even spiked below the USD 0.500 support as discussed yesterday. XRP/USD tested the USD 0.495 level and bounced back. It is currently recovering, but it may face a strong resistance near USD 0.520. During the past few hours, a few altcoins gained traction, including XET, WAX and MANA. XET (Eternal Token) is up more than 25% and WAX extended gains and traded up around 18%. Overall, bitcoin price extended its downside correction and it is not at a risk of a downside break below USD 6,480 - USD 6,500. Should BTC/USD fail to bounce back above USD 6,550, sellers are likely to gain strength. A daily close below USD 6,480 or USD 6,450 may accelerate declines in bitcoin in the coming days. Similarly, ethereum must stay above the USD 208 support and ripple price should break the USD 0.520 - USD 0.525 resistance zone to move back in a positive zone.

In the third quarter of 2018, we continued to drive strong growth at scale. $SQ https://t.co/HPhSMfVgac — Square IR (@SquareIR) November 7, 2018  Square released a full digest of its total earning and financial activities. The release was far more colorful and interactive than most public companies’ earnings reports. It included various pie charts, graphs, and diagrams, uncommon in the earnings space. Earlier this year, the newly public company introduced Bitcoin support in its Square Cash payment app. Compared to Q2, cryptocurrency revenue grew $6 million in Q3. “Total net revenue was $882 million in the third quarter of 2018, up 51% year over year. This includes $43 million of bitcoin revenue,” the report reads. Square has been on the rise lately, as its market cap just passed Twitter’s this week. Coincidentally, Jack Dorsey is CEO of both companies. While media interest may be down in cryptocurrency this year, this earnings report shows that there is still interest in the crypto space. >> A Guide to Understanding Cryptocurrency White Papers Bitcoin profits remain a niche for Square, and the company only brought in profits of around $500,000 after taking into account Bitcoin purchasing costs. This past October, Square expanded its interaction by open sourcing its cold storage set up and expanding its crypto offerings in new jurisdictions. Square just recently launched Square Terminal, which allows merchants to take debit and credit card payments. There have been rumors circulating about the possible merchants’ integration with BTC, but there have yet to be any official reports on the matter. At press time, Bitcoin is currently trading at $6,515.40 a coin, down -0.11%.

BTC/USD even traded above the USD 6,600 level and later started a downside correction. The price is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) consolidating gains above the USD 6,550 support and dips remain supported. Similarly, ethereum retreated from the USD 225 resistance and it is currently trading near the USD 215 support. Besides, ripple and bitcoin cash have corrected lower and both are approaching important support levels. Total market capitalization  A fresh correction wave was initiated from well above the USD 6,600 level in bitcoin price . BTC/USD traded below the USD 6,575 level and tested the USD 6,550 support (the previous resistance). The price is currently consolidating and it seems like there could be a renewed upside above USD 6,580 in the near term.
On the flip side, if there is an extended downside correction, the price may perhaps test the next major support at USD 6,500. The overall price action is positive as long as bitcoin is above USD 6,550 and USD 6,500. Ethereum price  also corrected lower recently and traded below the USD 220 level. ETH/USD tested the USD 215 level and it is currently consolidating. If it stays above USD 215, there might be an upward move above the USD 220 level.
If not, the price could slide further towards the USD 208 support, which was a significant barrier for buyers previously and now it is likely to hold losses. Bitcoin cash price  started a sharp downside correction below the USD 600 level. BCH/USD is down more than 4% and it is currently heading towards the USD 570 support. If there are further losses, the price may well test the USD 550 support. On the upside, an initial resistance is near USD 600, above which the price may retest USD 630.
Ripple price  is slightly under pressure as it failed to stay above the USD 0.530 and USD 0.525 support levels. The next major support awaits near USD 0.500 where XRP/USD will most likely find a strong buying interest. On the upside, the previous supports at USD 0.525 and USD 0.530 might act as resistances.

To sum up, it seems like bitcoin is correcting recent gains, but there are many supports on the downside between USD 6,560 and USD 6,500. If there is a downside break below USD 6,500, there are chances of a sharp decline in BTC/USD. Similarly, ethereum must stay above the USD 208 and USD 202 support levels.

At the same time, the number of long positions on the exchange has increased, overtaking the number of shorts on November 2. Prior to that, the bears have consistently been in the majority, as seen in the chart below. Bitcoin short orders in red and bitcoin long orders in blue on Bitfinex: Meanwhile, the ratio between short and long positions on bitcoin has dropped to 0.86, which means that there is now a net long-bias among Bitfinex users. That marks a distinct change for the market, which has been overwhelmingly short-biased over the past few months.

Bitcoin short-to-long ratio on Bitfinex: It’s worth noting that distorted market conditions where either the long side or the short side becomes “overcrowded” tends to cause temporary reversals in the market. This is for example what we have seen happening during the multiple “short-squeezes” this year, leading to sharply higher prices. Similarly, an abundance of long trades can cause pullbacks to become sharper and more violent than they would otherwise be.

On the upside, the price is likely to climb above USD 6,600 once again and it seems like buyers might attempt to push the price above USD 6,650 or USD 6,700 in the near term. Ethereum price  continued to trade higher and it recently broke the USD 220 resistance. ETH/USD is showing a lot of positive signs and it seems like the price may accelerate towards the USD 225 and USD 230 levels in the near term.
If there is a downside correction, the USD 215 - USD 216 zone is likely to act as a solid support. Below the stated zone, the next key support is at USD 210, which was a resistance earlier. Bitcoin cash price  started a fresh rally and surged above the USD 575 and USD 600 resistance levels. BCH/USD is up around 15% and it seems like the price is preparing for a test of the USD 650 resistance. The main supports on the downside are aligned near the USD 620 and USD 620 levels.
Ripple price  mostly remained flat and it is slowly correcting lower below USD 0.540. It seems like XRP/USD could extend the current correction and test the USD 0.525 support area where buyers are likely to emerge. Many small cap altcoins gained traction recently and traded up more than 5%, including AOA, QTUM, ZEC, BTM, GXS and ZEN. Out of these QTUM is performing really well as buyers pushed the price above the USD 4.00 resistance. Overall, bitcoin buyers are gaining pace and it seems like the price is likely to climb higher towards USD 6,650 and USD 6,700 levels in the coming sessions. If BTC/USD breaks the USD 6,700 barrier, it could boost the market sentiment and altcoins like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, neo, litecoin, icon, wan and binance coin possibly might gain upside momentum.

Kevin Davitt, a Senior instructor at CBOE Options Institute, published a video on November 1st outlining the volatility decline.  In the video above, Davitt outlines that the average weekly volatility for XBT-CBOE Bitcoin (BTC) futures on the week ending October 26th was just three percent. This is the lowest level of volatility since the futures contracts launched on December 10th, 2017. As of the first of November, the average weekly XBT high-low range on front-month Bitcoin futures since inception is 15.65%. Since tax day, mid-April 2018, this weekly average had dropped to 10.6%. “As it turns out, [Bitcoin] XBT futures and cryptos in general are moving with very little speed. The week ending Oct. 26th was the least volatile since futures were introduced nearly a year ago,” Davitt told MarketWatch. This CBOE Bitcoin (BTC) futures news is a positive one for institutional investors wanting to get into the crypto space, as high volatility is the reason most have stayed away. Even major banks interested in launching their own crypto products have been hesitant due to the volatility and current low-demand for these products. >> Crypto Airdrops are Now Illegal in China Former L/S Equities portfolio manager, Travis Kling, pointed out: Over the last month, BTC and Crypto markets broadly have hung in INCREDIBLY well in the context of traditional asset class stress.

Her site has supposedly evolved from a lifestyle newsletter into a “lifestyle brand” in the past 10 years of existence, but this Q&A is the first time cryptocurrencies are mentioned there. The Q&A delves into the basic questions of what Bitcoin is, how you can get some, and what gives it value. Barhydt also answers questions about other cryptocurrencies and blockchain itself for a short, simplistic overview of the topic.  Great piece with @billbarhydt on @goop today https://t.co/cBoeHJ9ts7 On the topic of value, Barhydt explains, “Ultimately, anything has value because people agree that it has value. Government-issued money, such as the US dollar, has value because we all agree that it does, mostly because our government accepts payments of tax debts only in its own money.” He also explains the unique points of Bitcoin versus fiat currencies, such as mining, the network effect and scarcity. He adds, “Lastly, we believe Bitcoin technology will be used to enable people in developing markets to lease home electronics such as washing machines, refrigerators, televisions, etc. The buyer will simply forward a small amount of Bitcoin every week to the wallet of the seller and this will enable the appliance to function. This is not easily possible with traditional government money, and it is a powerful possibility.” Featuring a Bitcoin Q&A on Paltrow’s site has the community divided. “...and people are calling this a bear market,” tweeted Jackson Palmer, creator of Dogecoin, in reply to Paltrow’s tweet. However, user @shillycrypto replies to him, “I genuinely hate Goop so I guess I have to sell everything now.” Goop is widely controversial and often considered a peddler of pseudoscience. From using stickers “made of spacesuits” to “rebalance energy” (which NASA debunked), over doing colonics to “remove toxins” from your body (unclear which toxins, and Mayo Clinic debunked that too), to letting bees sting you to “get rid of inflammation and scarring” (which killed a woman in Spain - and all of this is even without mentioning the jade egg controversy. In a similar vein, Twitter user @Leishman writes, “Can’t wait to buy my magic crystals with bitcoin! This is what the world needs,” while @CAntkow writes, “So this explains the price dropping…”  Paltrow is also far from the first celebrity to show interest in crypto.

The ranking, titled Global Public Blockchain Technology Assessment Index, assesses crypto projects based on criteria such as technology, applicability, and creativity, among other things. This time around, EOS secured the top spot, followed by Ethereum (ETH) and BitShares (BTS). A total of 33 public blockchain projects were assessed in the ranking. EOS is the fifth most valuable digital asset by market capitalization, while ETH is number two, and BTS is number 34. This is now the sixth time the ranking is released, and bitcoin has fallen consistently from the 13th place in the first ranking to the 19th place now. On the flip-side, however, EOS and Ethereum are two of the projects that have consistently gotten high rankings in the report, securing the first and second place in the past five ranking reports. “At present, EOS and Ethereum are undoubtedly the preferred platforms for dapp [decentralized application] development worldwide, and EOS is showing stronger momentum,” a translation of the report read. In a previous issue of the report, the authors also praised EOS, saying it received the number one spot because of its “outstanding technical advantages in transaction confirmation efficiency, network throughput, and transaction costs.” The fact that EOS secured the number one spot on the ranking is particularly interesting in the light of a new study from blockchain testing company Whiteblock, which shockingly concluded that “EOS is not a blockchain,” but rather a distributed homogeneous database management system. “EOS block producers are highly centralized and users can only access the network using block producers as intermediaries. Block producers are a single point of failure for the entire system,” Whiteblock’s new report said.",27.63000000000011,1

BTC/USD traded in a tight range near the USD 6,450 support and it seems like it is preparing for the next upward move. On the other hand, ripple jumped sharply and traded above the USD 0.475, USD 0.500 and USD 0.520 resistance levels. Ethereum is slowly rebounding and it is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) placed above the USD 208 support area. Overall, technical indicators are signaling additional gains in bitcoin and altcoins as long as BTC/USD is above the USD 6,400 support. Total market capitalization  After trading above the USD 6,500 level, bitcoin price  started a downside correction. BTC/USD corrected below the USD 6,480 and USD 6,450 support levels. Later, the price bounced back above USD 6,450 and it is currently consolidating. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 6,500, above which the price will most likely rally to a new weekly high in the short term.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 6,450, below which the price may revisit the USD 6,420 and USD 6,405 support levels. Ethereum price  is placed nicely above the USD 208 support level. ETH/USD is slowly grinding higher and it seems like the price may trade above the USD 215 and USD 200 resistance levels.
Above USD 220, buyers may perhaps find a strong selling interest near the USD 225 level. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 208, below which the price is likely to test the USD 204 support. Bitcoin cash price  held the USD 550 support and it is currently consolidating recent gains. BCH/USD could resume its upward move above the USD 575 level and it may even break the USD 600 hurdle if buyers remain in action. On the downside, the main support is at USD 550, below which the price is likely to decline to USD 500.
Ripple price  rallied recently and broke many resistance levels such as USD 0.465, and USD 0.520. XRP/USD is placed in a solid uptrend and it seems like it could continue to climb towards the USD 0.550 and USD 0.560 levels. A few small cap coins traded higher today and registered gains more than 5%, including WAX, MAID, XLM and ETP. A few losers were POLY, RVN, LINK, WTC and RRK, which are down between 5%-7%. To sum up, bitcoin seems to be preparing for a fresh upward move above USD 6,500. If BTC/USD gains pace above USD 6,500, there are chances of a push towards USD 6,600 or even USD 6,750. Similarly, Ethereum, ripple and a few other major altcoins are placed nicely in an uptrend and they are likely to climb higher in the near term.

BTC/USD did move higher in the past few sessions and broke the USD 6,450 resistance level. Ethereum price also gained bullish momentum and broke the USD 205 and USD 208 resistance levels. Also, bitcoin cash rallied after the cryptocurrency exchange, Binance announced support for the upcoming Bitcoin Cash hard fork. BCH/USD traded above the USD 500 resistance to move into a bullish zone. The current sentiment (UTC 08:30 AM)  in the market is positive. Total market capitalization  After forming a base above the USD 6,300 level, bitcoin price  started an upward move. BTC/USD traded above the USD 6,400 and USD 6,450 resistance levels. The price even broke the USD 6,500, but buyers failed to hold gains. As a result, there was a downside correction and the price tested the USD 6,450 support.
BTC/USD is currently up 1.3% to USD 6,475 and it seems like it could make another attempt to surpass the USD 6,500 resistance. On the downside, the main weekly supports are visible near the USD 6,450 and USD 6,400 levels.  Ethereum price  also followed bitcoin and gained bullish momentum above the key USD 200 barrier. ETH/USD traded above the USD 205 and USD 208 resistance levels to place itself in a bullish zone.
On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 210 followed by the weekly hurdle at USD 225. On the downside, the broken resistance at USD 200 is likely to act as a strong weekly support for buyers this week. Bitcoin cash price  rallied above the USD 500 barrier and spiked towards the USD 600 handle. Later, BCH/USD corrected lower and tested the USD 550 support. The price is currently up more than 5%, with an immediate resistance at USD 580. On the downside, the key supports are at USD 550 and USD 520.
Ripple price  is up more than 2% and it is currently trading near the USD 0.467 level. On the upside, XRP/USD buyers are facing important resistances near the USD 0.475 and USD 0.485 levels. Above these, the weekly resistance is at USD 0.500. Most altcoins gained more than 5% today, including DCN, BTG, DASH, VERI, WAX, MKR, DROP, MIOTA, MITH and BCN. While BAT showed strong growth on listing news.  Overall, bitcoin price is trading in a positive zone above the USD 6,400 weekly support. The current price action is positive, and if buyers clears the USD 6,500 hurdle, there could be continuous gains in BTC/USD and altcoins in the coming days. If not, bitcoin could correct gains and revisit the USD 6,400 support level in the near term.

BTC/USD broke the USD 6,350 level and traded close to the USD 6,450 resistance recently. Similarly, ethereum price traded close to the USD 204 level and it is currently consolidating. Ripple remained in a bullish zone and traded above the USD 0.455 level. It seems the market sentiment is slowly improving (UTC 08:30 AM) and sellers are exhausted. Therefore, if buyers gain momentum, there could be more bullish moves in bitcoin above USD 6,450 and 6,500 in the coming sessions.  Total market capitalization  There were positive moves in bitcoin price  above the USD 6,350 level recently. BTC/USD traded above the USD 6,400 resistance to enter a bullish zone.

The price is currently consolidating near the USD 6,450 level and it seems like it could climb higher once again. If it corrects further lower, buyers might appear near the USD 6,390 and USD 6,350 levels. On the upside, a break above the USD 6,450 resistance could push the price towards the USD 6,500 hurdle. Ethereum price  also moved higher and broke the USD 197 and USD 199 resistances. ETH/USD also spiked towards the USD 204 level before retreating back to USD 200.
The price is currently testing the USD 200 level, below which it could test the USD 198 level. If there are further declines, sellers are likely to take control for a push towards the USD 190 level in the near term.

The institution has stated that it classes Bitcoin as an institutional investment class. (And the day after Bitcoin’s birthday… how thoughtful) What this means is that it recognizes Bitcoin as a type of asset similar to shares, property, bonds, cash, or commodities. It also means good news for those hoping for a Bitcoin ETF. The bank’s research division reviewed the last six months of Bitcoin usage. What the researchers discovered was that permanent ledger technologies, hacks, hard forks, Bitcoin competitors, and market volatility have led to a conclusion that the most sensible way to classify BTC is as an institutional investment class. The researchers concluded that Bitcoin is not just a digital payment system or financial network, but an asset class in its own right. According to Coindesk: “Perhaps most notably, the report emphasized its ‘rapidly morphing thesis,’ which began by defining bitcoin as ‘digital cash’ and noting that investors had full confidence in it, to a solution for issues in the financial system, to a new payment system to ultimately a new institutional investment class.” The report detailed further: “Various issues and discoveries around the bitcoin ecosystem have caused the thesis to evolve, including the permanent ledger recording all transactions, a number of hacks, hard forks, new technologies which are cheaper than bitcoin, market volatility and other concerns.” >> Jamie Dimon Knocks Down Bitcoin Again Bitcoin has evolved. At present, $7.11 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) is being stored by hedge funds or capital firms. This is somewhat hypocritical as the original whitepaper of Bitcoin looked to avoid involvement with financial institutions. But adoption by major financial institutions is increasing, and it only serves to support the coin as a legitimate asset. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is up 0.94% today and selling for $6388, according to coinmarketcap.com. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© wolterke",59.63999999999942,1

Back in September of 2017, Dimon even went as far as calling it a “fraud.” He later retracted his statement and said that he was wrong for calling it a fraud but was still wary of the digital currency. Well, it seems Dimon has something different to say about Bitcoin now. Again. Two days ago at an AXIOS conference, the CEO was asked about changing his mind on Bitcoin, and he said, “I never changed what I said, I just regret having said it,” CNBC reported. Dimon continued by saying: “I didn’t want to be the spokesman against Bitcoin (BTC). I don’t really give a s*&^, that’s the point—okay? But Blockchain is real, it’s technology, Bitcoin is not the same as fiat currency.” Most major banking CEOs around the globe have taken a very similar stance on the matter. Nearly a year ago, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) CEO James Gordon stated that despite Bitcoin rising 700 percent in 2017, the digital currency was the definition of a “speculative investment and anyone thinking it might be stable is deluding themselves.” Gorman goes on to describe Bitcoin as “not even close to a safe investment.” >> Coinbase will Add Nearly 300 Coins in the Next Year but Won’t IPO Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is the exception among most major US banks. GS has been very pro digital currencies and is even recently rumored to have started onboarding some of its clients to sign up for its future crypto projects. There has yet to be an official statement from the bank on the matter, but the support shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, as the bank has been vocal about its crypto plans in the past. Despite the negative outlook on digital currency from Jamie Dimon and most of the major banks around the world, many of them  are working with some form of blockchain technology behind the scenes, to see if it can improve their day-to-day operations Just a few days ago, it was reported that nine Japenese banks have states using a Fujitsu blockchain settlement trial.

According to the data, 3 out of every 4 bitcoin in existence has not moved at all over the past 6 months, despite the downturn in the bitcoin market. The finding marks a big change from the situation during the bitcoin rally in late 2017, when about half of all bitcoins had been on the move. “It tells me we are still in a Bitcoin recession” https://t.co/sYJ19eJg0K pic.twitter.com/yInVvA9Shj The finding might be also surprising given the large number of new investors who flocked to bitcoin during the huge price rally of 2017. One might imagine that most of these new investors would be “weak hands” in the bitcoin market, susceptible to selling their holdings once the price moved lower. This, however, seems not to have been the case, which suggests that we have not seen the capitulation in the market many have been waiting for. According to many long-term believers in bitcoin, a “total capitulation” is needed for the market to finally find a bottom and form a strong foundation for the next bull market. “It tells me we are still in a Bitcoin recession,” Nic Carter, co-founder of Coin Metrics, told Bloomberg in a comment. According to Coin Metrics, up to 40% of bitcoins rarely moves because they are either lost or held in long-term cold storage. The firm further estimates that another 25% to 35% can be considered semi-liquid, which means they become active during bull markets as some long-term investors cash out to secure profits. Previously, research by weekly cryptocurrency publication Diar has revealed that over one third of the total bitcoin supply, or 55% of circulating bitcoin, is held in wallets with more than 200 BTC in each that have never made an outgoing transaction. Still, 27% of these wallets have continued to accumulate coins during the bear market in anticipation of the next leg up in the bitcoin market, the research showed.",59.63999999999942,1

Derivatives are tradeable instruments that gives a trader exposure to the price movement of an asset – in this case bitcoin – without owning the actual bitcoin. Specifically, the bank has reportedly onboarded clients to trade its forward contracts on bitcoin, a type of derivative that is tied to the futures market, The Block reported this week, citing a “direct source.” In other words, crypto trading at Goldman Sachs is still strictly limited to derivatives, and does not involve any “physical” cryptocurrencies changing hands.  However, the bank is in no rush to roll out more crypto derivatives products, according to the report. The source also said that earlier reports that Goldman is exploring similar derivatives contracts for ether “isn’t accurate.” The steps taken by Goldman Sachs in the crypto world is watched by many in the community due to its fame and position as one of the most prominent financial institutions in the world. ‘If Goldman Sachs embraces crypto, everyone else will too’, the reasoning goes. It is already known that Goldman Sachs is working to set up a trading desk for cryptocurrency derivatives. Back in September, Goldman’s Chief Financial Officer Marty Chavez (he’s leaving the post on November 5 to become Vice Chairman of the firm and Co-Head of the Securities Division) stated publicly that no plans had changed in regards to the trading desks, despite earlier reports that the bank would postpone the plans.

What began as an idea to challenge the financial establishment, has since grown to become a $110 billion market. The purpose of Bitcoin was straightforward; the digital asset, as a “purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”  By logging every transaction on a distributed ledger called the blockchain, the issue of “double spending” would also be solved. The ledger can be seen by anyone to verify that the transaction occurred. The network records every transaction and adds them to this ongoing chain, forming a log or record that can’t be changed or erased. As everyone has access to the network, no one body has control of it. Therefore it is secure and transparent. Blockchain technology is widely considered the most important innovation to come out of the creation of Bitcoin. So much so that this ‘distributed ledger’ technology has since been implemented by industries outside of cryptocurrency, including banking, farming, and healthcare. But those are only a few examples, and the list of adoption is constantly growing. Its first ten years has seen the digital currency spark mania. It has spawned hoards of imitator coins, it has risen to unprecedented values (20,000 per Bitcoin in 2017), and it has started an industry now rife with multi-billion dollar exchanges. Not to mention an industry of miners and blockchain coders. Bitcoin is even catching the attention of some of the world’s most powerful financial institutions despite being created to circumvent them. So, from such a small acorn came a ground-shaking oak tree. Invented by an anonymous cryptographer who went by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, on Halloween day, 2008, he, she, or they, wrote Bitcoin’s whitepaper and posted it to the world. Many have made claims to who Satoshi really is; Elon Musk was considered. He denied the claim. Some believe Nakamoto is a Japanese coder. But others believe the English on the whitepaper is too perfect and colloquial to not have been written by a native English speaker. So its first 10 years have seen massive financial gains and losses for hodlers of the coin. What will the next 10 years bring? Bitcoin’s original whitepaper has paved the way for technical advances that have occurred around Bitcoin. The value of the coin will always remain unpredictable, but the technological systems are only getting more advanced and more widespread. >> Coinbase is Now Valued at over $8 Billion After Series E Funding Round As developers and software engineers create different applications that improve the way we use Bitcoin and interact with the blockchain, user-experience is expected to improve: “Much like as internet based technology has improved over the years, mainstream Bitcoin users will understand very little of how the underlying protocols operate—they will simply follow the guidance of the applications they run on their machines.” Decentralization will obviously be a part of the future, but it will be interesting to note what industries adopt blockchain technology. One thing is for sure, Bitcoin turning 10 years old serves to remind us of how much this digital currency has changed the face of the current financial and technological era. Anything that can do that much in so little time paves the way for bigger things in the future. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© dmvasilenko",-19.38000000000011,0

BTC/USD is currently consolidating above the USD 6,300 level, but there are a lot of bearish signs visible on lower timeframe charts. Equally, ethereum is trading below the USD 200 support with a negative bias, which could spark a fresh decline towards the USD 180 level.  Other major altcoins like dash, bitcoin cash, neo and litecoin are struggling to recover. They are trading near yearly lows and remain at a risk of more losses. LTC/USD is currently trading well below the Oct 31, 2017 low of USD 56.00 and just above the US 47.80 yearly low. It seems like litecoin could decline further to trade to a new yearly low below USD 47.00 if it continues to struggle. Similarly, dash, neo and bitcoin cash are down and trading well below levels seen one year ago on Oct 31, 2017. More importantly, if sellers remain in action, these coins could accelerate declines and trade to a new 2018 low in the near term. Total market capitalization  After yesterday’s decline bitcoin price  found support near the USD 6,300 level and later started consolidating losses. BTC/USD is currently trading above the USD 6,330 level with an immediate resistance at USD 6,360. However, main hurdles for buyers are USD 6,380 and USD 6,400, above which the price might move back in a positive zone.
On the other hand, if the price fails to recover, it may perhaps slide back towards USD 6,300. Any further declines will most likely push the price towards the USD 6,250 support area. Ethereum price  is currently consolidating losses below the USD 200 level. ETH/USD seems to be preparing for the next decline if buyers fail to push the price back above the USD 200 and USD 202 resistance levels.
On the downside, an immediate support is at USD 195, below which the price could trade to a new monthly low. The main support for buyers on the downside is near the USD 180 level. Bitcoin cash price  is struggling a lot below the USD 430 level. It seems like BCH/USD may continue to slide and it could break the USD 400 handle as well to form a new yearly low. 
Ripple price  is slowly declining towards the USD 0.440 support. If XRP/USD fails to stay above the USD 0.440 support, sellers may well gain strength to take the price towards the USD 0.420 level. On the upside, resistances are seen near USD 0.450 and 0.455. Despite the current market sentiment, a few small cap coins traded higher between 6%-12%, including dentacoin, chainlink and pivx.
Overall, bitcoin price is slowly approaching key supports like USD 6,250, below which there is a risk of a sharp decline. If buyers continue to struggle, there is a possibility of a larger downward move in bitcoin, ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin, dash, neo and other major cryptocurrencies.

Her Majesty's (HM) Treasury is working closely with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to consider the tax issues raised by cryptoassets and the revised guidance is estimated to be released by early 2019, according to a new report from the UK’s Cryptoasset Taskforce, jointly published by HM Treasury, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and the Bank of England.  Both authorities recognise the risks of tax avoidance and evasion arising from the increased use of cryptoassets and are continuing to review the range of enforcement tools and approaches at HMRC’s disposal, the report added.   Also, in the report, several heavy-handed measures are discussed to regulate and control how British citizens should interact with digital assets. In the report, the FCA – the UK’s main financial regulator – said that “there are substantial potential risks associated with cryptoassets” and that the government’s priority is to “mitigate” these risks, “and prevent the use of cryptoassets for illicit activity.” The authors added that “strong action” should be taken by the authorities to address the perceived risks. Perhaps the most severe action proposed in the report is a potential ban on all cryptoasset derivatives, including futures contracts and contracts for difference (CFDs), which are all popular instruments among traders. According to the report, “the FCA will consult on a prohibition of the sale to retail consumers of all derivatives referencing exchange tokens such as Bitcoin, including CFDs, futures, options and transferable securities.” The futures market, for example, is already a heavily regulated marketplace where large traders either take bets, or hedge risks from elsewhere, with the use of contracts that track the price of an underlying asset – in this case bitcoin.  Ironically, an active futures market for bitcoin has been mentioned as a requirement from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for it to approve any bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF). Now, it appears the UK is moving in the opposite direction as it seeks to ban any futures contracts based on cryptoassets such as bitcoin. Meanwhile, the report stressed that “the authorities will continue to encourage and enable experimentation and innovation, so that DLT [distributed ledger technology] and other new technologies can develop and be adopted safely in the financial system.”   It also added, that “the backbone of the existing payments system – the Bank of England’s new RTGS [real-time gross settlement] service - will be compatible with DLT - based payment systems, supporting further innovation and use of DLT in financial services.” Although the report did also list potential benefits of cryptoassets, they were few compared to the risks discussed.  The report noted that cryptoassets today deliver few benefits, but added that “benefits may materialize in the future, for example through the use of ICOs [initial coin offerings] as a capital raising tool.” In the community, people are discussing whether the proposed regulations by the Cryptoasset Taskforce are appropriate, with some even asking if the agency is going far enough: UK moves in the right direction to provide regulatory certainty on #cryptoassets and #cryptocurrency.  I'm sure a welcome development. However, will it be enough? https://t.co/rc2XiV3LR6 Others, however, question the authors’ level of understanding of the subject matter: It's also funny that the Cryptoasset Taskforce calls cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin ""exchange tokens"" pic.twitter.com/OifROyT64n In the past, the FCA led a group of global regulators known as the Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN) in drafting a consultation document on the issue of regulatory sandboxes for fin-tech firms. Among other things, the document proposed that regulators in different countries should work together to “support responsible innovation” in areas such as distributed ledger technology and ICOs, as well as requirements pertaining to know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML).",-19.38000000000011,0

The DoJ has characterized his sales as an unregistered ‘Bitcoin exchange.’ Burrell failed to register his business with the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the US Department of Treasury and did not apply due diligence on the sources of his client’s funds, such as AML. “Unlicensed money transmitting businesses, especially those operating at or near the border, pose a serious threat to the integrity of the US banking system, and provide an ‘open door’ for criminals to utilize such businesses to launder the proceeds of their illicit activities,” said US Attorney Adam Braverman. “The Department of Justice will continue to investigate and prosecute all individuals and businesses that seek to evade the licensing and anti-money laundering requirements under federal law.” In addition to failing to comply with federal regulations, Burrell admitted that his account on an unnamed US crypto exchange had been closed due to suspicious transactions. >> World Crypto Con: Joel Comm and Travis Wright Host the Show! After being shut down on that exchange, he turned to a Hong Kong-based platform and purchased $2.29 million worth of Bitcoin in a two-year span. Burrell conducted hundreds of transactions with this exchange from March 2015 to April 2017. The press release concludes with Burrell admitting that his exchanged USD was stored in Mexico. He has also pled guilty to making a false declaration on his federal tax return and is awaiting that trial in mid-December. Burrell imported over $1 million between late-2016 to early 2017, to evade tax declaration. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© stevanovicigor",-2.769999999999527,0

According to the report, bitcoin “could alone produce enough CO2  (carbon dioxide) emissions to push warming above 2°C within less than three decades.” However, at the same time the authors acknowledge that bitcoin mining is becoming more energy efficient. Meanwhile, other experts and scientist who spoke with ThinkProgess, a news website backed by the think tank Center for American Progress Action Fund, described the study’s assumptions and conclusions as “reckless” and “dangerous, irresponsible, and misleading.”  According to mechanical engineering professor Eric Masanet, head of the Energy and Resource Systems Analysis Lab at Northwestern University, the conclusions in the study can be debunked by pointing to three flaws: First, he said, “we know that the global power sector is decarbonizing.” Secondly, the IT sector, including mining of cryptocurrencies, is becoming more and more energy efficient. Lastly, he said the authors behind the study are “insisting on tremendous growth in cryptocurrency adoption, resulting in inflated and dubious estimates of future carbon emissions.” Arman Shehabi of Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, a Department of Energy Office of Science lab managed by University of California, agreed with Masanet, and added that the authors of the study were on the wrong track by focusing on a very unlikely scenario where “the electricity demand of bitcoin transactions and the carbon emissions from that electricity demand both remain static over the next hundred years, while at the same time bitcoin immediately undergoes rapid adoption.” He told ThinkProgress that it is “absurd” to believe the energy consumption of each individual bitcoin transaction will remain constant over the next hundred years, saying “that’s a crazy assumption in general, but downright bananas for blockchain mining.” Back in August, Katrine Kelly-Pitou, Research Associate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh also said that the worries about bitcoin’s energy usage are exaggerated. Instead, she argues, the important factor is not how much energy bitcoin consumes, but what the energy sources are, while advocating for more mining in countries and regions with an abundant supply of clean and renewable energy. According to Kelly-Pitou, bitcoin mining uses an exorbitant amount of power: somewhere between an estimated 30 terrawatt hours alone in 2017 alone, while banking consumes an estimated 100 terrawatts of power annually.",-2.769999999999527,0

Per newspaper La Estrella de Panama, “a handful of users” have claimed that their bank accounts – and those of their cryptocurrency-trading acquaintances – “were closed upon [the banks] learning that they traded in cryptocurrencies or just for having [crypto holdings].” Trading in cryptocurrencies is not illegal in Panama, a country with the population of 4 million, but the newspaper stated “it seems that the financial sector has gone from caution to rejection.” Crypto community leaders bemoaned the fact that their relationship with the banks “has been very, very complicated” so far. The newspaper says it has been in touch with several banks in the country, which have all so far chosen not to respond on the matter. It quotes Felipe Echandi, co-founder of Panama Fintech, a Panamanian blockchain community and pressure group, as stating, “I don’t work with cryptocurrencies personally, but I do know of cases where [banks have refused to deal with clients involved with cryptocurrencies].” Echandi added, “Unfortunately in Panama, in the case of fintech enterprises, it is very complicated for banks to open accounts. I had to go explain my own business model 50 times to different banks.” The country’s banking regulator, the Superintendency of Banks of Panama, has previously warned the public about the “risks” associated with trading in cryptocurrencies, stating that government regulations do not cover the exchange, purchase, sale or investment of digital tokens. The lack of regulation in the crypto and blockchain space, especially for projects that raised funds through initial coin offerings (ICOs), is keeping even compliant projects from working, as previously reported by Cryptonews.com. Some projects eve complain that ""If you’re a good citizen complying with accounting, opening bank accounts, doing everything correctly, you can still get hit every single week by institutions, service providers, partners that tell you they’re not working with you anymore just because you’re dealing with cryptocurrencies.""

And leading the drop-off is the largest coin by market cap; Bitcoin dropped from over $6,500 to a new two-week low of $6,243 in early trade today. The coin has lost over $200 in a 24-hour period, and as happens more commonly than not, there is no definite reason for the sudden drop. The sudden Bitcoin drop has come somewhat as a surprise. The world’s biggest coin has been hovering between $6,600 and $6,400 for 14-days straight. A stint that has notably been its least volatile period in over a year. But perhaps the Bitcoin drop was overdue. The equities market is about to close its worst month since 2008’s financial crisis, and where that market threads, Bitcoin tends to follow. Across the board, we can see the effect of the Bitcoin drop. But maybe investors are shaking in their boots because of a new report released today about Bitcoin and climate concerns.

This represents yet another example of traditional investors moving into the cryptocurrency industry - a recent trend that has been on the uprise throughout 2018. Bitstamp CEO, Nejc Kodrič, writes in the official announcement, “Bitstamp has been regularly approached by suitors for quite some time. The reason why we finally decided to sell the company is a combination of the quality of the buyer, the quality of the offer and the fact that the industry is at a point where consolidation makes sense. A major factor in agreeing to the sale is that the mission, leadership and vision of the company remains the same.”  Through the purchase, NXMH acquires an 80% stake, while Kodrič retains a 10% ownership interest in the exchange, according to Reuters. Pantera Capital Management LP, which made a USD 10 million investment in the company in 2014, also sold part of its stake in Bitstamp to NXMH, the report added. NXMH, with assets under management of more than EUR 2 billion, is the European subsidiary of South Korea-based NXC, which invests in digital technologies. NXC also owns South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Korbit and Nexon, a South Korean gaming company.  Back in April this year, the exchange had been rumored to be in talks with Nexon regarding the acquisition. Nexon Korea CEO Lee Jung-hun denied the rumors that pegged the price of the exchange at around USD 350 million. In 2016, Bitstamp was valued at USD 60 million, Kodrič told Reuters today. Kodrič stresses that nothing about Bitstamp’s services will change: “We do anticipate that this acquisition will strengthen Bitstamp’s positioning for growth, which will provide opportunities to better serve our customers. Customers should not have any concerns about their accounts or changes to the way we operate,” he adds. Bitstamp was founded in 2011 in Slovenia by Kodrič and Damian Merlak. However, Marlek sold his entire 30% stake in Bitstamp with the deal, and has not been active since 2015, according to Reuters. The registration of the company was moved to the UK in April 2013, then to Luxembourg in 2016. The company was founded as a European-focused alternative to then-dominant bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. While the company trades in US dollars, it accepts fiat money deposits for free only via the European Union's Single Euro Payments Area, a mechanism for transferring money between European bank accounts. Top markets on Bitstamp: As traditional investors are moving into the space with increasing frequency, this seems to be the boost many companies need: after the Singapore-based BK Global Consortium bought a controlling share in South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb, trading shot up by some 25% over the following weekend.  Japan is another example of this trend. Coincheck was taken over by financial services company Monex earlier this year after falling victim to a hack in January, with another financial sector company, Fisco, set to complete the takeover of last month’s hack victim, Zaif, late next month, as Cryptonews.com previously reported. “Major companies are likely to continue targeting [exchanges] for a while yet,” wrote Japanese business media outlet M&A Online in an editorial piece.",-159.72000000000025,0

We are in the process of a thorough investigation for this. We are extremely sorry that it has to come to end like this. Until the investigation is over, we cannot refund anything. Later they added that “because we have no more funds to pay anyone back, the exchange has to close down unfortunately.” According to the archived version (October 28) of the exchange's website that claims it’s “a swift, reliable and to-the-point trading platform for veterans and newbies alike”, it has more than 8,000 registered users and it's daily trading volume was more than BTC 900 (USD 5.8 million) “today.” Meanwhile, on October 27, the exchange announced that its maintenance was “officially over and we have finished upgrading our server” and invited to “enjoy our new sleek look, stay tuned for future updates as we're not yet done.” As of Monday morning, the website is unavailable. Following the news yesterday, members of the community have been hard at work to find out who is behind the exchange, which does not provide information on its team members online. A Twitter account called Maplechange’ed has already identified the person they believe is behind the questionable exchange as a young man living in Edmonton, Canada, along with many other details about the people behind the exchange. Following the first Twitter post, the exchange disabled their Twitter account, and rumors of the “hack” actually being a classic exit scam quickly started circulating online.  6 Million Dollar Exit Scam. Rofl In case of an exit scam, someone who runs a crypto service first builds up trust among customers, who then go on to deposit money with the service. Once a sufficient amount of money or digital assets have been gathered, the service shuts down and the operators disappear. As many would probably agree, disabling social media and other communication channels “to think this solution through” is a highly suspicious way of handling what the company claims to be a hack.  However, five hours later, MapleChange’s Twitter account finally came back online with this tweet: We have not disappeared guys. We simply turned off our accounts temporarily to think this solution through. We cannot refund everyone all their funds, but we will be opening wallets to whatever we have left so people can (hopefully) withdraw their funds. The incident should serve as an important reminder to everyone in the crypto community not to keep fiat or crypto stored on any exchanges. Instead, it is generally recommended to transfer funds to external software or hardware wallets where the user holds the private keys, after a trade has been completed. MapleChange has not yet responded to a request for comment on this story by Cryptonews.com. We will update the story once we hear from them.",-159.72000000000025,0

It may be a sign that bitcoin is nearing a bottom, according to experts. However, no one knows when the next major move will happen.  Compared to last Monday, the bitcoin price is practically unchanged, giving developers the calm they need to put their heads down and work, while traders are becoming increasingly restless. Bitcoin price chart: Over the past 12 days, bitcoin prices have been so stable that technical analysts, who make trading decisions based on patterns and indicators on charts, are scratching their heads trying to figure out where the price is headed next.

Equilibrium between supply and demand is amazing. Will not last long. $BTC pic.twitter.com/L4N5Sa06c3 As expected, the bitcoin community responded with a sense of humour, as they often do:  pic.twitter.com/oyZWz3w4FK In an article from CNBC this weekend, bitcoin’s record-low volatility is presented as surprising news given the sharp sell-off that occurred in the global stock market last week. “As U.S. stock markets went haywire this week, the major cryptocurrency known for giving investors whiplash was surprisingly calm,” according to the report. However, the network’s go-to guest for all-things crypto, CEO of crypto investment firm BKCM Brian Kelly, reminded that crypto remains a non-correlated asset class, saying “I don't know of anyone saying 'Microsoft dropped, I better sell bitcoin to cover my margin’.” Meanwhile, others argue that low volatility is a sign that bitcoin may be nearing a bottom. As Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone noted, high volatility is a major factor lessening most cryptocurrency use cases for anything other than speculation. In the same report by Bloomberg, Charlie Morris, multi-asset head at Atlantic House Fund Management in London, added that ""Given this bear market is now 10 months old and is getting tired, I’d be inclined to be bullish for the next major move.” In the meantime, Google searches do not show that people’s interest in bitcoin is picking up, which might mean that the market relies on existing investors, mostly.    Looking at global search interest for the word “bitcoin,” we can see that it is now at the lowest levels seen since April 2017, when the price of bitcoin was just over USD 1,000.

BTC/USD is currently (UTC 06:20 AM) struggling to hold the USD 6,450 support level and it seems like it could decline further in the near term. Similarly, ethereum price struggled to move higher and it is currently trading near the USD 200 support. If there is a downside break below USD 200, ETH/USD may possibly decline sharply. Ripple is comparatively stable above the USD 0.450 support, but it is facing a tough resistance near the USD 0.460 and USD 0.462 levels. Total market capitalization  There was no upward move above USD 6,500 in bitcoin price . BTC/USD remained under pressure and it slowly moved down towards the USD 6,450 support. At the outset, it seems like the price is struggling to remain above the USD 6,450 support and it could continue to move down towards the USD 6,400 support.
If sellers gain momentum, there is a risk of a downside break towards the USD 6,250 level in the near term. On the other hand, buyers need to clear the USD 6,500 and USD 6,550 barriers to push the price back in a positive zone. Ethereum price  also followed bitcoin as it struggled to break the USD 205 resistance zone. ETH/USD is currently moving lower towards the main support at USD 200.
If sellers succeed in gaining strength below the USD 200 support, the price may decline sharply towards the USD 190 or USD 185 level. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 205, above which the price may attempt to surpass USD 208 and USD 210. Bitcoin cash price  declined below the USD 440 support, which is a bearish sign. It seems like BCH/USD could continue to decline towards the next support at USD 425. The next key support below USD 425 is near the USD 405 level. The main resistance for an upward move is near the USD 450 level.
Ripple price  is currently consolidating above the USD 0.450 support. XRP/USD may climb further higher if there is a break above the USD 0.460 and USD 0.462 resistances. On the flip side, a break below USD 0.450 may increase bearish pressure on ripple. Today, a few altcoins gained more than 10%, including revain, kyber network (KNC), veritaseum and nexo. Out of these, revain rallied more than 30% and KNC gained around 25%. Overall, bitcoin price seems to be under pressure below USD 6,500. If BTC/USD continues to struggle to clear the USD 6,500 and USD 6,550 resistance, there could be a fresh downward move. Altcoins also remain at a risk of a downside break if they continue to face heavy selling interest.

The current price action indicates that the price is trading in a tight range above the USD 6,400 and USD 6,450 support levels. If there is a break below USD 6,400, bitcoin could decline sharply in the near term. Ethereum price  found a strong buying interest near the USD 200 support once again. ETH/USD recovered a couple of points, but it is still struggling to clear the USD 205, USD 208 and USD 210 resistance levels.
On the other hand, if sellers manage to clear the USD 200 support, the price may perhaps come under a lot of selling pressure. The next support in the mentioned case could be USD 185. Bitcoin cash price  is stuck in a USD 20 range. BCH/USD is facing a solid resistance near the USD 450 - USD 460 zone, and on the downside, there is a major support near the USD 430 level. If the price settles above the USD 450 and USD 460 resistance levels, it could rise sharply towards the USD 500 level.
Ripple price  failed to clear the USD 0.470 resistance and started a downside move. The XRP/USD pair tested the USD 0.450 support and it is currently consolidating near USD 0.455 for the next move. Today, a few altcoins gained more than 8%, including RVN, MGO, ETP, VERI, STRAT and NEXO. Out of these, RVN rallied more than 15% and MGO was up roughly 13%. To sum up, bitcoin price remains confined in a tiny range above the USD 6,450 support. BTC/USD must break the USD 6,500 and USD 6,550 resistance levels. If buyers continue to fail, there is a risk of a sharp downside break towards the USD 6,200 level. Similarly, ethereum price could nosedive if it continues to fail near the USD 208 and USD 210 resistance levels.

Made by Reddit user u/BTCGamer, the game lets you buy rigs, fans, research better ones, expand your space, etc. Published on Newgrounds, the online community for entertainment including gaming, filming, audio and artwork composition, the game has close to 50,000 views as of the time of writing. You start out with a small room that consists of six desks and 0.08 BTC. For now, you can only afford a desktop from Bell Computers that generates 0.01 BTC per minute and doesn’t use electricity. Once you make enough money, you can buy a 6 GPU Custom Mining Rig for 0.3 BTC and install it on the second table. It generates 0.3 BTC per minute and doesn’t use electricity either. Rigs can be overclocked (by making them ""run faster"" than originally intended), making them generate more BTC, but you can only overclock one rig. From then on, you keep the game open and wait until you generate enough bitcoins to “research” new miners to improve the amount of BTC earned per minute. Keep in mind that most of these do use electricity, though, and the cost will be automatically deducted from your in-game balance. All miners generate heat as well - how much depends on the rig itself. Overheating the room makes you lose the game, so invest in coolers as well! The visuals of the game are very rudimentary, and the music may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but it can be turned off. However, it is the product of a single person, so expectations should be low to begin with. The creator also takes everyone’s criticisms into account and adds features according to that. Although there is practically no replayability value, the game is a great insight into how mining works - and how boring it is most of the time. It has a score of 3.58 out of 5 on Newgrounds, and 179 people added it to their Faves. On social network Reddit, the game received pretty positive acclaim, where one user even mined more than 21 million - a significant amount of time spent in the game, at the very least.

Elon Musk has been impersonated by scammers in the past, who have made fake accounts of him offering fake crypto ‘giveaways.’ Binance’s founder even took notice and responded to Musk’s tweet and said: Lol, it's spreading. I will buy a Tesla if you accept crypto… https://t.co/IgdieNZA0H — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) October 23, 2018  The rest of the comments were a flood of crypto enthusiasts promoting the digital token they’re most passionate about or people who were utterly confused. >> How to Lose Money Quickly Crypto Day Trading Unfortunately, Musk wasn’t actually endorsing or taking a stance on the digital currency but was simply making fun of it. That is correct — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 23, 2018  Bummer; the tech entrepreneur would be a huge contribution to the cryptocurrency space, despite his recent meltdowns. Musk has had a heck of a year this year. First, Tesla Model 3 production hit many snags, as the car model took longer to manufacture than previously anticipated. Investors started growing anxious wanting their car. Musk is also CEO of SpaceX and has been launching many rockets into space on a monthly basis in 2018, and he is CEO of the Boring Company, which is working on an underground trial tunnel under SpaceX’s headquarters to fix Los Angeles’ traffic problem. Currently, Mr. Musk is being investigated by the SEC for potential fraud. To say it’s been a bad year for him is probably the understatement of the year. While Musk may not be on the crypto train just yet—there’s still hope. Featured Image: wikimedia.org",3.380000000000109,1

BTC/USD seems to be struggling to clear the USD 6,500 and USD 6,550 resistance levels. Similarly, ethereum price is holding the USD 200 support, but it is facing a lot of offers near the USD 208 and USD 210 levels. Other major altcoins like bitcoin cash and ripple also faced an increased selling pressure as they declined below key supports. Going forward, there could be more range moves in the crypto market before the next major move. Total market capitalization  Buyers struggled to gain momentum, resulting in a few bearish moves in bitcoin price  below the USD 6,500 support. BTC/USD settled below the USD 6,500 support level, which is now acting as a resistance. Above this, the next major hurdle for buyers is near the USD 6,550 level. To move into a positive zone, the price has to surpass the USD 6,600 resistance.
On the downside, an initial support is near the USD 6,450 level, below which the price may decline towards the USD 6,400 support area. Any further losses will most likely put sellers in full control in the short term. Ethereum price  tested the USD 200 support area and it is currently consolidating losses. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the USD 208 level, above which the key resistance is at USD 215.
On the flip side, if sellers push the price below the USD 200 support, then there could be a sharp sell-off in ETH/USD. In the mentioned case, the price may possibly test the USD 185 level. Bitcoin cash price  attempted a recovery above the USD 450 level, but it failed to gain bullish momentum. BCH/USD declined and traded below the USD 450 support. The next key support is at USD 440, below which the price may decline to USD 425.
Ripple price  failed to hold gains above the main USD 0.450 support. XRP/USD is currently down around 1% and it is likely heading towards the USD 0.440 support area. On the upside, resistances are at USD 0.452 and USD 0.460. A few altcoins rallied today by more than 1%, including LINK, DCR, POLY and MOAC. Out of these, LINK gained around 26% and DCR was up around 25%. Overall, bitcoin price is slowly moving lower towards the USD 6,400 support area, which holds the key in the near term. To recover, the price must settle above the USD 6,550 level and then clear USD 6,600. If not, there is a risk of more declines in BTC/USD and altcoins in the coming sessions.

Binance has received an undisclosed amount from Vertex Ventures, the venture capital arm of government-owned investment company Temasek Holdings Pte from Singapore. The investment is set to boost Binance’s plans to allow users of their platform to trade crypto for the Singaporean dollar and vice versa. The platform only recently started testing fiat to crypto transactions in Uganda, as they opened a chapter of their company there. Meanwhile, Bakkt, a heavyweight crypto platform launched by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, will start clearing Bitcoin futures on December 12th. According to the ICE-issued document revealing the details of these news, the “physical” Bitcoin backing the futures contract will be held in a so-called “digital asset warehouse” that was created by Bakkt and ICE in a collaborative effort. As pointed out by Joseph Young, a cryptocurrency reporter and analyst, Bakkt’s upcoming arrival could likely catalyze thousands of traders to invest in this space and may even persuade the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to reconsider their position on this market.  It will For those who don’t see what the big deal about institutional investors’ support for crypto is, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, offered an explanation. He asked on Twitter, “What happens when a fund like Fidelity allocates a mere 5 percent of their portfolio to crypto?  Have you calculated how much that is?”  He further explains:  Right, that little 5% is more than doubling (almost tripple) the entire crypto market cap. And some people are still worried about... pic.twitter.com/EETSyQXjnm As reported in October, the fourth largest asset manager with USD 7.2 trillion in assets under management, the US-based Fidelity Investments has announced that it is launching a new company aimed at financial institutions that want to trade and store digital assets.",3.380000000000109,1

As most traders are aware, the stock market has generally been considered far less volatile, and less risky, than the crypto market. However, this belief is now being put into question as a result of unusually stable prices for the number one cryptocurrency. The CBOE data showed that bitcoin’s 20-day historical volatility has fallen to 31.5%, lower than that of well-established publicly traded companies like Amazon, an e-commerce giant, and Netflix.  20-day Historical Volatility “A one standard deviation move for bitcoin is about USD 475. That works out to +/- 7.3% […],” Kevin Davitt, a senior instructor for the Options Institute at CBOE, was quoted as saying by Marketwatch. According to him, in mid-January, “the standard deviation measured $4,640 or +/- 42%.” A standard deviation in a market is a measure of how often a certain move in prices can be expected to occur on average. Following a normal distribution, 68% of all moves are within +/- 1 standard deviation. Although low volatility represents a challenge for active traders, long-term holders and bitcoin enthusiasts see it as a positive development for the digital asset, bringing it closer to the vision of it becoming “digital gold.” “Perhaps we are witnessing the maturation of a market. It’s far too early to declare this the ‘new normal’ but the persistent range over the last few weeks may be hinting at a structural shift,” CBOE’s Davitt concluded. Other experts have also suggested that the recently low volatility of the bitcoin market could be a sign that the market is maturing. Earlier this month, Gil Luria, research director at wealth management firm D.A. Davidson & Co., hinted that there is less speculation in the bitcoin economy today. “When speculators are involved, they drive unusually high volumes as well as volatility by trading the asset with high frequency. As speculator involvement is diminished, volumes go down and volatility goes down as well,” Luria said at the time.",3.380000000000109,1

Tom Lee, Wall Street market analyst and Bitcoin bull, remains convinced that Bitcoin could still surpass USD 20,000 - even in spite of the year-long bear market. In an interview with Heidi “BlockchainChick,” a crypto influencer, he said that “people are too bearish” and that there is still time for his prediction to come true. The head of Fundstrat Global Advisors, a market analyst company, explained: “What happens is, people get bearish because it makes sense. I mean, market’s been terrible and we’re below 200-day [moving average] and we [at Fundstrat] published a report this week that pointed out to our clients that when Bitcoin is under its 200-day, it only goes up 50% of the time in the next six months. But when it’s above its 200-day, it is up 80% of the time, so the trend implied by the 200-day is obviously very important.” He still stands by his USD 20,000 prophecy: according to Fundstrat’s research, by year’s end, the break-even cost of mining bitcoin will rise to USD 8,000 - USD 9,000. According to the analyst, bitcoin often trades at over two times its break-even - and sometimes even three to four times the number - so Lee doesn’t consider his price prediction all that bullish in the first place. However, there is still a big question in the air: what’s the bottom? “Until people are convinced that there’s a bottom, like there are a chicken and an egg, you can’t motivate people until the [bottoming] event happens,” he adds. A recent informal poll by Fundstrat indicated that the usually very cautious Wall Street investors are now overwhelmingly calling a bottom in the bitcoin market. Twitter users, however, are still skeptical, with a majority saying bitcoin still has room to fall. Meanwhile, Lee is not the only one who believes the end of the year could bring respite from the market red. The cryptocurrency community on Reddit, a social network site, had one user reappropriate a quote from Benjamin Franklin: “In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes,” and u/ideaDash adds, “Crypto November.” There are those who believe that Bakkt could turn the market bullish, while others maintain that Novembers in previous years constitute no guarantee for a bull run.  The community forgets a single truth, however, spoken in 1991 by Guns N’ Roses: “Nothin' lasts forever / And we both know hearts can change / And it's hard to hold a candle / In the cold November rain.” Maybe Axl didn’t originally mean a crypto candle, but possibly he’s revised his opinion by now.

However, not everyone agrees with the analyst.  In the chart, posted to Twitter on Friday, Willy Woo showed that the Bitcoin blockchain blocks reached 95% of capacity last week. Meanwhile no noticeable change has been recorded in the transaction fees required to successfully make a payment on the network. As of Monday morning, average transaction fees on the Bitcoin network stood at around USD 0.36, per data from blockchain analytics company Blockchain. Meanwhile... during the bear market no less... Bitcoin's blocks peak above 95% full without anyone noticing, the fees and confirm times remain nominal. Bitcoin of 2018 is not Bitcoin of 2017. The protocol is quietly improving. pic.twitter.com/ZgtpBnQFbJ The chart from Woo supposedly illustrates that despite higher levels of network congestion today compared to last year, transaction fees today remain normal and well under the levels from last year. However, other cryptocurrency experts such as Alan Silbert, executive managing director at INX Limited, an owner and operator of a platform for trading blockchain assets and their derivatives, and Adam Back, founder and CEO of Blockstream, a blockchain startup, have something to add: Good point, and also because of the weighting the backwards compatible serialisation of base blocks (removing the signatures for old nodes) will never reach 1MB so it becomes artificial. even though the full block is 2.2MB -- because the weighting rule is that body + sig/4 < 1MB. At the time of writing, the discussion between the three is not over yet. Meanwhile, some other members of the cryptoverse have also shared their opinions on the matter: It's obvious what happens. As tx volume increases it will bump into the limit leading to a supply constraint, spike in the mempool, and increased fees. _____ Check your math/logic.  Last bull run block usage went up about 25% (800K-->1M). But capacity is now 100% to 200% higher than before.  So there will be no delays and fees will not go up much, if at all. No matter who is right, Bitcoin still lags far behind traditional alternatives like Visa or MasterCard in terms of the number of transactions per second (TPS) it can handle.  With current capacity, the Bitcoin network is able to process about 7 TPS. That compares to Visa’s payments network, which is able to handle more than 24,000 TPS. As Pantera Capital’s co-CIO Joey Krug reiterated in an interview last week, the cryptocurrencies of today can be compared to “the Internet before dial-up,” where they are not scalable. He went on to say that this is the first thing that needs to be solved in order for cryptocurrencies to enter the next bull phase and gain mainstream adoption.",1.1099999999996726,1

In a civil case, the Court of Arbitration in Irkutsk ruled in favor of local energy provider Irkutskenegro, who had alleged that the church, Grace, began using an inordinately high quantity of electricity in May 2017 – and had billed the religious group accordingly. Energy is highly subsidized in Russia, and Irkutsk residents enjoy some of the lowest power prices on the planet. However, energy providers only offer subsidized rates to residential and non-industrial users. Illicit miners, say providers in the country, can be charged retrospectively with industrial rates. Per Interfax and FTimes, Grace had disputed the provider’s charge, and denied that it was using electricity for Bitcoin mining – instead claiming that in May last year, the church had installed several printers to “produce religious literature.” However, the court heard that local printers in fact used just a small fraction of the energy Grace had used in the same period. Irkutskenegro stated that the church had consumed a whopping 2 million kW/h in May to August 2017. This is not the only surprising instance of an unauthorized cryptocurrency mining in Russia. On February 9, 2018, scientists at a Russian nuclear center were arrested for the offense of using resources at the center to mine cryptocurrencies.  Also, the case bears similarities to that of a Cherepovets resident who was found to have kitted out an otherwise-empty apartment with mining rigs – and was later ordered to pay similar charges. Meanwhile, Russian parliamentarians have appeared to backtrack on plans to include a definition of cryptocurrency mining in a long-awaited package of crypto-specific legislation. As previously reported, the head of the committee overseeing the bills earlier this month stated that cryptocurrency mining would be defined so that miners could be taxed, although “cryptocurrency” and similar terms would not be given legal definition. The move led to major criticism from fintech, law and IT experts in the country. Per Interfax, the committee now says it plans to remove all mention of crypto mining from the bills to avoid mentioning cryptocurrencies at all – although the government still plans to tax crypto miners for their “entrepreneurial activities.” Critics in the country have argued that this latest decision simply muddies the issue yet further. The bills have already passed their first hearing, and were slated to have been given a second and final reading by the end of October – a deadline that it seems lawmakers will now struggle to meet.",1.1099999999996726,1

Gox exchange is rapidly approaching; claimants have until Monday, October 22nd to send proof of being a victim in the exchange’s hack.  Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee of the exchange opened up the process in August as part of its civil rehabilitation process. A separate Q&A document, published in August, says that, “The planned deadline for the Rehabilitation Trustee to submit a statement of approval or rejection to the court is January 24, 2019, but, at the current point in time, a definite date has not been determined.” There has been no update on this situation as of right now. However, according to a Reddit post on the topic, during a Q&A session of the creditors meeting on September 26th Kobayashi confirmed that he is going ahead with self-admission of claims. These so-called zombie claims mean that if the trustee is aware of anyone who should have a claim, he will file a claim on their behalf. In other words, anyone that had an account on Mt. Gox and appears on their database, even with just a few dollars or satoshis on the exchange, will have a claim filed in their name. However, if the funds are unclaimed after a certain amount of time, it will pass to the Japanese treasury. According to reports, there are about 75.000 small accounts that make up about 10% to 20% of total claim value. ""In practice this means a reduction of claim value for BTC claimants, and the Japanese government benefiting. Our group (mtgoxlegal.com) are currently fundraising to keep our lawyer on this,"" the post reads. However, there is no official announcement regarding the ""zombie claims."" The road to recovery has not been completely smooth to all claimants, however. In a subreddit dedicated to the legal proceedings of Mt. Gox, many users complain that the call center is hard to reach, even during business hours, and that the process itself is confusing.  The community also speculates that the payout should happen around summer to fall 2019. Reddit user u/Btc_Hawker said they were attending the previous creditors’ meeting on September 26th, and writes, “[I] will be asking the trustee to pay out an interim distribution of all the cash owed to depositors and the vast bulk of the Bitcoin in February. There is no justification for further delay once civil rehabilitation is approved.” The user did not further update on this. The next Mt. Gox creditors’ meeting is set for March 20th, 2019. Before that, the period to examine Proofs of rehabilitation claims is set from January 31st to February 7th, 2019.  Launched in July 2010, by 2013 and into 2014 Mt. Gox was handling over 70% of all bitcoin transactions worldwide, as the largest bitcoin intermediary and the world's leading bitcoin exchange, according to Wikipedia. Mt.

At a ceremony in the capital, Yerevan, acting Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan was joined by the head of the consortium that has constructed the farm, Armenian billionaire (and so-called oligarch) Gagik Tsarukyan. Per news outlet Yerkramas, Tsarukyan claims that the farm, which is the brainchild of his Multi Group conglomerate, cost some USD 50 million to construct, and has been equipped with an initial 3,000 mining rigs. The company is planning to expand that number to 12,000 in the near future. The farm will initially mine Bitcoin and Ethereum. Yerkramas states that the facility is based on two floors: the ground floor is a business and management center, with an entire floor given over to servers and equipment above. The media outlet says that Tsarukyan and Pashinyan – who tendered his resignation from his post two days ago in a bid to call snap elections – were joined by business leaders from China, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates and “a number of other countries” for the opening ceremony. Tsarukyan is quoted as saying, “Guests are coming to Armenia from almost 40 countries [to see the mine]. This is an important step towards the development of the information technology sector in Armenia, especially since representatives of foreign business circles are planning to meet with members of the government to discover more about the possibilities of making new, larger investments in the Armenian economy.” The farm will initially receive some 50MW of power from a thermal energy plant, with “an agreement in place” to provide an increase in capacity to 200MW, per Armenpress. Watch this video from the opening of the farm: Earlier this year, the country’s government legalized mining in anticipation of the farm’s opening, although cryptocurrency trading remains illegal in Armenia.

And this time it really did went viral, spreading the word about the world of cryptocurrencies: almost 2.5 million views on YouTube and Twitter in less than two days. eToro, a multi-asset platform which offers both investing in stocks and cryptocurrencies, released an ad featuring actor Kristian Nairn, better known as the character Hodor from the record-breaking TV series Game of Thrones.  Kristian Nairn portrays the beloved character Hodor, the simple-minded servant of a noble house in the TV show Game of Thrones, who can only say the word Hodor which, in turn, gave him the name. The character spends a significant amount of time carrying a young boy on his back in the show, communicating only with that one word, which is derived from the phrase ""hold the door"".  The ad follows the actor listening to offers for advertisements in which he always carries something on his back and says “Hodor.” Tired of being pigeonholed, he tells his agent to find him something “with a tie”. Well, the result is below: The community went absolutely wild over the advertisement. Nairn’s character was universally beloved - the episode featuring a significant plot twist involving Hodor’s past and future which brought fans to tears has been universally acclaimed as well as receiving a 100% rating from review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. The choice of character, the play on words and the simple message of the ad had fans in a frenzy. “Thanks @eToro for proving that advertisements can be funny again,” writes Twitter user @FleitzPierre, while user @CryptoPoland adds, “A serious actor who reminds us the ads can be more engaging, funny and enjoyable, all at the same time.” Other people are finding more easter eggs in the ad: “Anyone else notice the elevator buttons? Moon or Rekt,” writes Reddit user u/jaynemesis. Then, there are those speculating on other characters of the show and the ways they’re leveraging the world’s economy to serve their own goals… But that does not really have much to do with Hodor.

A 24-year-old man who was found dead in his apartment in Oslo, Norway on Monday morning, had earlier sold bitcoins to another person for cash, according to Norwegian broadcaster TV2.  The victim reportedly brought the large sum of money back to his apartment, where he was later found stabbed to death. It is unclear exactly when the bitcoin trade took place. “We are aware of a tip relating to bitcoin, but we do not wish to elaborate on it at this stage of the investigation,” Grete Lien Metlid, head of the intelligence and investigations unit at the Oslo Police Department, told TV2.

After failing to show up for work Monday morning, the victim was found dead by one of his roommates at 12:15 the same day. Before that, he was last seen on Sunday night as everyone who lived in the apartment were preparing to go to sleep. It remains a mystery how the murderer got into the apartment and carried out the crime without waking up any of the other roommates.

Learn how market participants are using BTC to manage risk in changing markets. https://t.co/Yt41SzsHku pic.twitter.com/Kw4OX0QaKT Meanwhile, so-called open interest, meaning the amount of new money that is flowing into the market, also increased by 19% since the last quarter. Generally, increasing open interest is seen as a sign that market participants are taking a greater interest in a market, strengthening the already existing price movements.  In the case of the bitcoin market, this could mean that the current “range-bound” pattern in the market is being reinforced by trading taking place in the futures market. The introduction of bitcoin futures trading on CME Group’s exchange on December 17, 2017 coincided with the peak in bitcoin prices last year, when bitcoin hit nearly USD 20,000 on several cryptocurrency exchanges. Trading on CME’s market followed the launch of the first-ever bitcoin futures market on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) one week earlier.  However, futures were blamed for Bitcoin’s fall from its peak.  “The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence. It is consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the introduction of futures markets for an asset,” according to research from the San Francisco Federal Reserve.",-65.61999999999989,0

This amount of Bitcoin equates to $194 million, and a transaction of this magnitude would usually incur bank fees in the tens of thousands of dollars. With such a small Bitcoin fee for such a large transaction, will we see widespread adoption for big over-sea payments? Bitcoin transactions are a funny one. Often, complaints roll in by the dozen about the cost of transaction fees because to clear a transaction on such a high-volume network means paying for expensive miners. But this transaction shows the potential of the Bitcoin blockchain to perform cross-border payments cost-efficiently and effectively. Claims have risen before about transactions on the Bitcoin network costing $60. As recently as October 14th, cryptocurrency critic Nouriel Roubini, economist and professor at Stern School, made such a statement. However, his claim was met with fire: “BTC fees are less than $0.10, easily verifiable. If you value truth, you’d provide a public correction.” So if this transaction did indeed only cost the sender a small Bitcoin fee of $0.10, then it throws regular banks into chaos. >> Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum Foundation Hands Out Over $3 Million in Awards To put it in perspective, the cheapest platforms available to transfer fiat currency abroad still ask for a percentage of the cost, and that percentage is far greater than $0.10. For example, on a platform like Transferwise, to send over $1 million, it costs over $7,500 in transaction fees. Percentage-wise, this figure is less than 1% of $1 million, so $7,500 is considered cheap for a transfer that large. However, using the Bitcoin network at $0.10 for the same transaction is astronomically (and literally) cheaper than $7,500! The biggest issue with the Bitcoin network and transactions has been scalability. But this is an issue that is being resolved. Bitcoin’s Lightning network is offering the ability of on-chain and second-layer solutions. This means the network, in effect, can process small payments faster. But at the scale of $194 million, massive firms and investors will no doubt prefer the Bitcoin network for over-seas trading, would they not? Why would you want to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in bank fees when you can pay a small Bitcoin fee of 10 cents only? I know what I’d choose. What about you?

In an interview with Bloomberg he also said that the market has already hit its bottom this year. Krug further compared the most recent bull market to the current market, saying that news about early adoption by some institutions sparked a surge in speculative investments two years ago. This time around, however, he believes the market is waiting for more “actual adoption” of digital assets, and decentralized applications (dapps) in particular. He went on to compare the current state of dapps to “the Internet before dial-up,” where they are not scalable, and people are not using them for that reason, hinting that this is the first thing that needs to be solved. Although Joey Krug and Pantera Capital, a crypto investment firm and hedge fund, remain very optimistic about crypto over the long-term, Krug did warn that prices could continue in their current “range-bound” pattern for a while.  When asked if it is right that he doesn’t believe the market will rebound for the next two years until scalability is solved, Krug answered that “we could see a rebound before then, but I think that’s gonna be the real catalyst that drives the next huge bull-run in my opinion.” In August, Pantera announced that it is looking to raise up to USD 175 million for its third venture fund. This is a significant jump from its previous ones, as their second one was USD 25 million, whereas its debut deployed USD 13 million back in 2013. However, Pantera Capital’s Digital Asset Fund was still showing loss in August.   Pantera releases some painful performance numbers for their new #crypto fund. #bitcoin #ethereum pic.twitter.com/Do6D8sxHla In the meantime, new solutions that help Bitcoin to scale are being launched. Recently, San Francisco startup Blockstream launched the Liquid Network, a Bitcoin sidechain, which marks ""the beginning of a new era of digital asset issuance and transacting by enabling the tokenization of fiat, gold, securities, and even other new crypto assets – all with Bitcoin at the center."" The sidechain has become another important development for Bitcoin alongside the Lightning Network. In comparison, while the Liquid sidechain is purpose-built to cater for the needs of exchanges, brokers and traders, the the Lightning Network is designed to enable the near-instant transfer of small or micro value payments between linked channel members and merchants.

The bike is a pretty standard model, with an electronic conversion kit retrofitted. The battery for the e-bike powers a Raspberry Pi controller with an e-Ink display to keep power consumption low - as the creator says that the biggest drain on power is the USB modem/network card necessary for Lightning communication. Both on his GitHub, a software development platform, and in a tweeted video, Steinig explains how to use the bike: “You select on the display how long you want to drive, get a QR code that you scan and pay for with your Lightning mobile app, after that the power for the selected period is turned on. The special about this system, it's mobile, the communication is realized via the mobile network and the power comes from the battery of the e-bike.” The video in his tweet shows the practical side of this. The bike charges 250 satoshis (BTC 0.00000250 or USD 0.016) per minute, and once the QR code is generated, you have 60 seconds to pay using your Lightning app. Once the payment is made, the system powers on and you’re free to ride around for the selected time. As Steinig explains, “After the end of the paid time, the system switches off and the power supply is interrupted - of course you can continue driving, but only with muscle power.” Hey, here's the promised video of using the lightning-bike, hope you like it! pic.twitter.com/ul2gBXc2id While the community likes the innovation, it would be a surprise if people didn’t crack a few jokes on the topic. “Looks on-chain to me,” says Reddit user u/kattbilder. “Proof of cables,” tweeted user @milancheck. Others point out that this is still very much only Proof of Concept: for example, the controller only limits access to the e-bike functionality. At the end of your time period, or indeed without using the Lightning Network payment system at all, you can still ride off with the bike using pedal power. Still, there are those that see the silver lining. As Twitter user @barryhackamac says, “Would be so nice to use this as a tourist and not have to set up some locally specific app with foreign exchange commissions etc.” User @daggeroflight11 tweets, “It’s things like this that will bring mass adoption. Not ETFs. Not Wall Street. Smart motivated people finding use cases and running with them. Great work!” Meanwhile, smart and motivated people are building other great things that might help cryptocurrency adoption. For example, in September, a group of developers have completed the first off-grid cryptocurrency transaction using blockchain and shortwave radios as well as solar power.

However, BTC/USD found support near the USD 6,500 zone and is currently consolidating near the USD 6,600 level. Similarly, ethereum price declined sharply and tested the USD 205 support. Other altcoins like ripple and bitcoin cash price are trading above key support levels and they could slowly grind higher in the near term. Total market capitalization  After a downside correction, bitcoin price  found a strong buying interest near the USD 6,550 level. BTC/USD recovered above the USD 6,600 level and it is currently struggling to clear the USD 6,640 resistance. Above this, the next major hurdle for buyers is near the USD 6,700 level.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 6,550, below which the price could test the USD 6,500 support. In case there are more declines, the price will most likely revisit the USD 6,400 support, which is a strong barrier for sellers. Ethereum price  trimmed most gains and declined below the USD 215 support. ETH/USD tested the next key support at USD 205, which prevented further slides.
The price is currently consolidating with an immediate resistance at USD 210. Above this, the price may well test the USD 215 resistance. On the downside, the USD 205 and USD 200 levels are important supports for buyers. Bitcoin cash price  is currently trading above the USD 450 support with a bullish angle. However, BCH/USD seems to be struggling to clear the USD 470 and USD 480 resistances. If there is a bearish reaction, the price could break the USD 450 support. The next key support is positioned at USD 430.
Ripple price  traded with a positive bias above the USD 0.450 level. XRP/USD is positioned nicely above the USD 0.450 and USD 0.440 supports, and it seems like the price is likely to accelerate above the USD 0.465 resistance in the near term. A few altcoins traded higher recently, including AOA, DGD, BCN, XTZ, ICX, KNC and HOT. Out of these aurora (AOA) rallied more than 20% and DGD gained around 17%. Overall, bitcoin price is still holding the key support at USD 6,400, which is a positive sign. Therefore, as long as BTC/USD is above USD 6,500 and USD 6,400, there are high possibilities of a fresh upward move towards USD 6,700 or USD 6,800 in the coming sessions. Similarly, ETH/USD could rise towards USD 215 or USD 220 as long as it is above the USD 200 support.

After reports that the major player in the crypto industry Coinbase failed to predict demand from large investors, and banking giant Barclays reportedly halted work on a cryptocurrency trading project, the market has received two positive news.  The fourth largest asset manager with USD 7.2 trillion in assets under management, the US-based Fidelity Investments has announced that it is launching a new company aimed at financial institutions that want to trade and store digital assets. Meanwhile in Japan, the world’s first public offering of a crypto-focused investment fund is set to go live.  The new company, dubbed Fidelity Digital Assets, will offer much-needed institutional custody services in “offline, vaulted deep-cold storage,” which could be just what many some of the bigger players on Wall Street have been waiting for before taking the leap into crypto, and offering it as a mainstream asset class to their clients. ""<..>Fidelity was seeing a steady increase in calls from large financial institutions regarding the company’s plans for handling digital assets, specifically with respect to custody and executional services,” the company said in a blog post, adding that “Institutional interest in digital assets is expanding, and these organizations require sophisticated capabilities in order to proceed.” According to former Wall Street banker-turned crypto entrepreneur Mike Novogratz, Fidelity Digital Assets will work with his company Galaxy Digital as its “alpha crypto custody client” going forward: Exciting news.  We are thrilled to  announce #GalaxyDigital as @Fidelity @DigitalAssets’ alpha crypto custody client #theherdiscoming https://t.co/87yeysYSFM Fidelity, which has over 70 years of experience in the financial services industry, will provide custody solutions to large trading firms that operates in the huge over-the-counter (OTC) market for cryptocurrencies. Fidelity Digital Assets reportedly has a staff of 100 people, and is led by Tom Jessop, a former Goldman Sachs managing director and president at tech startup Chain.  “Someone like Fidelity coming into this market we think will have a positive effect on the whole market,” Jessop was quoted as saying in a media statement.
____ Tom Jessop sits down with Bloomberg's Erik Schatzker to discuss Fidelity's new business to manage digital assets for hedge funds, family offices and trading firms: Arianna Simpson, managing director at crypto-focused venture capital fund Autonomous Partners, reacted to news: The Fidelity news is huge. Don’t you see what is happening?! What an extraordinary moment in time. Back in June, several media outlets reported that Fidelity was secretly working on setting up its own cryptocurrency exchange, largely based on reports that the veteran financial firm was actively hiring engineers for its new project. The job posting reportedly read that the engineers would be needed “to help engineer, create and deploy a Digital Asset exchange to both a public and private cloud.” Subscriptions for the new retail-oriented fund, dubbed Epoch Digital Assets, were opened on October 15, and are to be capped at 100 billion yen, or about USD 900 million, per a press release from the company. It claims that it's world's first public offering of a cryptocurrency and digital assets related fund. The new fund will reportedly operate in a hedge fund-like manner, investing in other funds, initial coin offerings (ICOs), and directly in digital assets, in an effort to smooth out the wild swings that the crypto market is known for, while still aiming to reap the rewards.  “We were very keen to undertake the world's first public offering of a cryptocurrency fund in Japan and look forward to great things ahead […] In the future, digital assets are likely to become an integrated part of investment portfolios, similar to equities and fixed income products today, albeit on a smaller scale,” Epoch partner James Skinner said in a statement. Meanwhile, in a separate announcement, heavyweight crypto platform Bakkt said that its exchange and clearing house boards — and the clearing house risk committee — ”have all reviewed and approved the respective rules” and will file these rules publicly with the the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for review and comment “very soon.”  “We’re taking a transparent approach to engage across the industry as we begin testing and onboarding in November, and trading and warehousing in December, subject to CFTC approval,” Kelly Loeffler, CEO of Bakkt, said.",-5.300000000000182,0

In what appears to be short-term traders positioning themselves for a further sell-off in bitcoin on the Bitfinex exchange, the ratio of short-to-long orders on the exchange reached 1.54 during the Asian trading session Tuesday morning, a level not seen since November last year. Short-selling essentially involves speculating on lower prices in a market by borrowing an asset that a trader doesn’t currently own in order to sell it in the market. The asset can then be bought back at a lower price later, allowing the short-seller to profit from the difference between the selling price and the buying price. While a high number of sellers in a market is generally considered a bad sign, it also opens up opportunities when it reaches extreme levels. This is what is known as a short-squeeze, and it is something we have seen repeatedly this year as the short-to-long ratio has hit the high levels we are at now. 
If the market starts to move upwards in the near future, many of the short-sellers will exit their short positions by buying back bitcoins in the open market. As the price moves further up, even more short-sellers will get margin calls or hit their pre-set stop-loss levels, forcing them to cover their shorts, and creating a self-reinforcing mechanism that can cause sharp price increases. Whether this will happen again this time, however, still remains unclear. Another possible explanation is that there is a significant amount of arbitrage going on right now centered on the Bitfinex exchange, following the surge in the bitcoin price yesterday that brought the price on Bitfinex to nearly USD 7,800 at its peak. That was close to USD 1,000 higher than on other exchanges like Coinbase, where bitcoin reached a high of about USD 6,800 yesterday.  An obvious way for traders to take advantage of a situation like that is to short-sell bitcoin on Bitfinex, while buying bitcoin on Coinbase or another exchange. That way, a trader would be profiting as the price gap between the exchanges closes. The bitcoin price was nearly unchanged across exchanges on Tuesday morning, and still remains significantly higher on Bitfinex than on other exchanges, which many in the community attributes to speculation and fear about the status of the popular stablecoin Tether.

There was a sharp upward move in BTC/USDT above the USD 7,500 level due to a nasty slide in Tether below the USD 0.950 support. BTC/USD also gained traction and surged above the USD 6,500 and USD 6,700 resistance levels. However, buyers failed to hold gains and bitcoin price reversed most of its gains. BTC/USD is back to USD 6,600 and it is currently trading with a positive bias. Similarly, ethereum, bitcoin cash and ripple rallied recently before trimming most of their gains. Overall, the recent price spike ignited a lot of volatility in the crypto market, which could help bitcoin buyers in the short term. Total market capitalization  After testing the USD 6,200 support, bitcoin price  started an upward move. BTC/USD broke the USD 6,350 and USD 6,400 resistance levels to climb sharply higher. It even spiked above the USD 6,850 resistance, but sellers quickly reversed the bias. 
The price declined sharply and traded below the USD 6,700 level. It is currently trading near the USD 6,600 mark, with an immediate support near the USD 6,500 level. The most important support on the downside awaits at USD 6,400. On the upside, the price needs to regain the USD 6,700 level to climb back towards USD 6,800. Ethereum price  broke the USD 200 resistance zone to enter a positive area. ETH/USD climbed above the USD 205 and USD 215 resistance levels.
The price also traded above the USD 220 level, but later it declined below USD 215. It is currently up 5% to USD 211, with an immediate support at USD 210. On the upside, buyers need to settle the price above the USD 225 resistance for further gains. Bitcoin cash price  rallied above the USD 450 and 475 resistance levels during the recent upward move. BCH/USD tested the USD 490-500 resistance zone, which prevented further upsides. The price is currently down to USD 462 and it may well continue to trade lower towards the USD 450 support.
Ripple price  surged above the USD 0.450 resistance and even spiked above the USD 0.465 level. Later, XRP/USD reversed gains and it is currently trading near the USD 0.445 level. It seems like a proper close above the USD 0.450 level is needed for a larger upward move. Many altcoins gained traction and moved up between 7%-20%, including komodo, DROP, holo, bytecoin, BTG, DGD, MOAC and NPXS. Overall, the recent upward move in bitcoin price seems like a false spike, but as long as BTC/USD is holding the USD 6,400 support, it could climb higher once again. Similarly, if ETH/USD stays above the USD 210 level, the pair may possibly retest the USD 225 resistance.

While major cryptocurrencies skyrocketed, investors are worried about the drop of the biggest stablecoin Tether. The top three cryptocurrencies by market cap - Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple - are were up by around 10% on Monday morning before trimming their gains to less than 7%, while the other follow suit with slightly smaller price jumps. One notable exception, however, is Tether (USDT): the stablecoin pegged to the US dollar was down to USD 0.86 before recovering to USD 0.96. Tether price chart: Bitcoin price chart: Top 10 coins by market capitalization (UTC 07:37 AM): Although the rest of the market seems like a cause for celebration, Tether’s downward plunge got the whole community worried. The biggest question: is Tether truly backed by USD? The company has yet to provide conclusive evidence of this, despite their repeated insisting that all Tethers are redeemable at USD 1. Since cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and Tether share the same CEO, speculations about the extent of their involvement with each other abound. Bitfinex has come forward with a statement that they are not insolvent only a week ago, but that “complications continue to exist for us in the domain of fiat transactions.” In the eyes of traders, the downward spiral of one could spell disaster for the other. Tether’s role as a dollar substitute has made it a huge part of the global crypto ecosystem. Playing a big part on exchanges that do not support crypto-to-fiat trading, it is easily transferable between all exchanges and other online platforms because it doesn’t have to travel through the banking system. This means Tether is the second-most actively traded cryptocurrency: it was used in more than 20% of transactions tracked by coinmarketcap.com over the past 24 hours. Vijay Ayyar, head of business development at Luno, a cryptocurrency exchange, said for Bloomberg, “If traders start to flee Tether, it’s a potentially precarious situation, since it accounts for 20% of total volumes globally. It basically implies a lot of volatility ahead.”  Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin has halted Tether deposits and withdrawals, citing “USDT wallet system maintenance” and without any information when trading may commence.  Bitfinex has news, also: Fiat deposit update - October 15th, 2018. https://t.co/F8o2ltVCN4 pic.twitter.com/ukE9JsRB0j The community is worried: on the popular social network Reddit, user u/Toyake commented, “Tether is currently trading at 91 cents, this could very well be its collapse. If Tether goes down, the whole market goes down. Get the popcorn!” In short, the community believes that people are selling Tether and buying Bitcoin.  Community reactions: The key point here is that USDT panic manifests in manic crypto-buying on Chinese exchanges (Binance, OKex, Huobi) where there are a lot of USDT holders, and of course on BitfinexThis premium in crypto is the real ""Tether panic-selling"", not the /USD pairs on Kraken/Bittrex ______ Well, this is a nice and exciting way to end all that boring sideways.Won't need coffee this morning. ______ There's indeed a big difference between Tether Exchanges and normal exchanges.However, on normal exchanges we're also breaking the downtrend as we speak and the price is there $6,600.I'm not scared about the USDT situation, I'm happy with the upwards movements. $BTC pic.twitter.com/Btz7J824xv ______ If this is a true bank run on $usdt, I would not be surprised if exchanges that have exposure to #Tether halted trading.Would that be positive for $BTCUSD?

However, the price is facing a few important resistances near the USD 6,380, USD 6,400 and USD 6,450 levels.
The mentioned resistances near USD 6,400 were supports earlier and now they are likely to cap upsides.

On the downside, an initial support is at USD 190, below which there is a risk of more losses towards the USD 175 level. Bitcoin cash price  tested the USD 425 level and recovered a few points. BCH/USD may continue to correct higher, but the USD 460 and USD 480 levels are likely to protect gains. The most important resistance for buyers is positioned near the USD 500 level. The key supports on the downside are USD 425 and USD 410.
Ripple price  recovered nicely and it is currently up more than 3% to USD 0.428. XRP/USD must break the USD 0.440 and USD 0.450 resistance levels to extend the current recovery towards the USD 0.500 level in the near term. Recently, Coinbase Pro announced that the 0x token (ZRX) will be launched on their platform, which boosted the price. A few other altcoins like LOOM, MANA and BAT also gained between 8%-15%. Overall, bitcoin found support near USD 6,200 and is currently recovering. However, buyers are facing a lot of hurdles near USD 6,400. Therefore, a major recovery in BTC/USD is very unlikely. If sellers regain control, there could be a fresh round of selling in bitcoin and major altcoins in the coming sessions.

Since June, almost 1,400 comments have been submitted. The SEC recently extended the time period for which it will review comments from the public on the matter. It further went on to list 18 detailed questions about statements made in the ETF proposal that it asked to public to comment on.  Jake Chervinsky, a Washington-based lawyer specializing in government enforcement related to the blockchain industry, tweeted: Reminder: you have one week left to submit comments in response to the SEC's questions on the VanEck/SolidX bitcoin ETF proposal.Go here (https://t.co/RpJfcOAvjM) & click ""Submit Comments on SR-CboeBZX-2018-040"" to tell the SEC what you think.Public opinion matters. Be heard! A decision on whether to approve or disapprove the proposed ETF is not expected until the first quarter of 2019. While the community is somewhat divided in terms of what benefits an ETF listing could bring to bitcoin, the general consensus remains that it will at least provide a temporary boost to the bitcoin price. Unsurprisingly, Gabor Gurbacs, digital asset director at VanEck, is among those who believe an ETF would bring strong benefits to the number one cryptocurrency: What an #ETF brings to #Bitcoin:-Increased liquidity via the AP & ETF ecosystem-Lower counter-party risk-Better valuation and execution practices -Separation of duties: trading, custody, valuation-Lower fees-Compliance with global regulations -Asset mgmt experience pic.twitter.com/R1ACMd3EQ6 Meanwhile, some members of the bitcoin community, including technologist and serial entrepreneur Andreas M. Antonopoulos, are against Wall Street money pouring into bitcoin in the form of an ETF. “ETFs fundamentally violate the underlying principle of peer-to-peer money, where each user is operating not through custodian, but has a direct control of their money, because they have direct control of their keys. Your keys - your bitcoin, not your keys - not your bitcoin,” Antonopoulous warned in August adding that Bitcoin ETF will become an instrument to manipulate bitcoin prices, scaling and forking debates.  In either case, until October 17, everyone has a chance to tell what they think.  Then comment and say so!I think any intelligent contribution to this discussion is valuable & worthwhile. It's also important for the SEC to get multiple informed perspectives so they can better understand crypto in general. And here is what people told the SEC (unedited):  Maxwell Gomersall
To whom it may concern,
I am writing about the Bitcoin ETF decision to express my opinion on your decision.  
I believe it is time you stop pushing the decision back and chose what to do, delaying the inevitable simply looks ridiculous. Many have sent you their opinions regrading this topic and are in support of an ETF and not to mention the institutions who are awaitning your decision. Postponing this is not going to change the outcome Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will have a large role in our future and this is one of the first steps as the innovators America is known as make the right choice and approve the decision as people will look back at this one day and wonder why it took so long to make such a clear decision.  
Furthermore, the decision is vital for the US economy as a stock market crash is due and once this happens many will lose their savings and jobs which without a safe and assuring alternative like Bitcoin many institutions will go bust or have no where to place their money making their growth stagnate. This will only be bad for the US economy as if they had the option to invest in Bitcoin they would be receiving positive returns which will lead to growth in their business and therefore growth in US economy despite the market crash which will happen in the next 4 months if not earlier.  
I strongly urge you to approve the decision before the opportunity is missed.  
Yoirs sincerely,

Dear members and representatives of the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"").
I would like to express my strongest opposition against allowing Bitcoin (""BTC"") Exchange Traded Funds (""ETF's"").
BTC shows little promise for being effective as a ""store of value"" or medium of exchange with its transaction costs being much more than the current centralized clearinghouse model that is in place today. Additionally, there is no accountability for transaction clearing, which can be concerning on many fronts. With little more than speculative supply and demand value, the average unaccredited investor can suffer from the ""greater fool"" phenomena.  
In its unregulated and short existence, BTC has existed in an environment of fraud, crime, and speculation, and I do not believe there is true investor value outside of those three factors for the asset. Because of the high transaction expenses, there are no reasonable efficiencies to be had from the BTC technology, though refinement and other applications may exist.
Sincerely,  
Robert Mulligan

After BTC dropped, a widespread cryptocurrency sell-off took place and hasn’t slowed down since. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $6,264.43 a coin, down -4.63%. Most of the cryptocurrency market has followed Bitcoin’s spiral, and most coins in the top 15 cryptocurrencies by their total market cap are seeing double-digit percentage losses. Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $201.10 a coin, down -11.07% in 24 hours, and XRP is now valued at $0.405 a coin, down -13.33%. The total cryptocurrency market cap has fallen by $19 billion in the past 24 hours. Since January, $600 billion has been wiped in value from the market. There are many speculations as to why Bitcoin tanked. One investor tweeted: It is plausible that investors and traders in Asia have contributed quite largely to the drop in the price of Bitcoin today. The volume of crypto exchanges in South Korea and Japan (Bithumb, Bitflyer) are huge. https://t.co/1nAHd9BezV — Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) October 11, 2018  The tweet still doesn’t explain why there was a sell-off, but it may show where it predominantly came from. “The global sell-off in equities has indeed spilled over to the crypto space,” Ryan Rabaglia, head of trading with cryptocurrency dealing firm OSL in Hong Kong, told Fortune. “The days of crypto being the safe-haven play and having a high degree of detachment from the rest of the world are seemingly diminishing.” Rabaglia seems to think that the global sell-off of equities has spilled over into the crypto space. Another analyst felt the Bitcoin dip was due to panic selling. Panic selling was the cause of the drop of cryptocurrency from January to February, but is that the case now? “What we’re seeing now is a bit of panic selling,” Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM told CNBC. “Investors that were in it, and maybe caught the hype in November and December, are now panic selling out.” I’m not so much convinced in the panic selling. It’s been nearly nine months since the cryptocurrency market plummeted and I think those with weak stomachs to the rises and falls of the crypto space have already left. >> A Crypto PayPal?

It's called the Liquid Network and it's live now. This is a sidechain built on the Bitcoin network by San Francisco startup Blockstream. A sidechain is a separate blockchain that is linked to the main blockchain through what is referred to as two-way pegging, which enables digital assets to be interchangeable between the two chains without jeopardizing their performance or speed. ""The Liquid Network provides fast, secure, and confidential transactions to address the needs of exchanges, brokers, market makers, and financial institutions around the world,"" Blockstream CSO Samson Mow said in a blog post.  According to him, the launch of the network after three years of development marks ""the beginning of a new era of digital asset issuance and transacting by enabling the tokenization of fiat, gold, securities, and even other new crypto assets – all with Bitcoin at the center."" The startup claims that Liquid has these benefits:  However, the biggest problem most bitcoin fans have with Liquid is that it is a “federated sidechain,” relying on a group of companies to collectively manage the sidechain, making it centralized. “Following a federated consensus approach was the easiest way to deploy Liquid, but its consensus could change in the future,” tweeted Lucas Nuzzi, bitcoin researcher.  Don't underestimate @Blockstream's #LiquidNetwork sidechain launch. It's kind of a big deal.I get it, federated round robin consensus doesn't sound appealing, but it's a start. The implications of usable sidechains are huge and the positives certainly outweigh the negatives👇 Moreover, the startup claims that ""no single party, including Blockstream, can control the Liquid network, and furthermore, no single entity is in control of more than a single Liquid functionary server."" Other than just facilitating faster trade, Liquid lets partners launch tokens on the platform, representing financial instruments, fiat currencies or crypto assets. The startup even claims that the sidechain works better than the smart contract blockchain Ethereum for launching tokens. Additionally, Blockstream will be deploying a wallet specifically for Liquid transactions, while hardware wallets Ledger and Trezor have unveiled plans to adopt the technology as well. Also, there is an undisclosed monthly subscription fee for users of this new network. The sidechain has become another important development for Bitcoin alongside the Lightning Network. In comparison, while the Liquid sidechain is purpose-built to cater for the needs of exchanges, brokers and traders, the the Lightning Network is designed to enable the near-instant transfer of small or micro value payments between linked channel members and merchants. Meanwhile, there is always that part of the community that doesn’t care about the technology too much. Twitter user WhalePanda, a famous crypto enthusiast, ironically tweeted referring to the recent drop in the market:   Last night's dump on all cryptocurrencies was obviously because of the release of Liquid.

The drop followed after a mysterious bitcoin whale had made a huge transaction, moving 22,100 bitcoins out of a wallet. At current market prices, the bitcoins are worth an astonishing USD 137.6 million. The transaction: ____
Bitcoin price chart: It is, however, unclear what the large transaction means for the market, as both the sending and receiving addresses are unknown. Still, the crypto community loves to speculate, with some Twitter users suggesting that it could be the result of a large over-the-counter (OTC) buy order. OTC trading refers to trading outside of exchanges – often favoured by large investors as they seek to avoid affecting market prices with their orders. Its looks like OTC buy order, as wallet is new, there is no old transactions. if this was transaction to exchange then it would dumped Others, yet, say that the transaction was merely a move from a single key wallet, to a multisignature wallet – a type of wallet that requires several private keys in order to make transactions. Moved from an address which was merely protected by one single private key to a multisig wallet. Only reasonable to do so with that amount. Although the so-called bitcoin whales are often blamed whenever are large downward price movements in the bitcoin market, new data compiled by blockchain analysis company Chainalysis suggests that this group of very large holders may in fact be a stabilizing force for the market. By studying available data on the 32 largest bitcoin wallets, Chainalysis found that whales are indeed a rather diverse group, and that only about a third of them could be considered “active traders.” Two thirds of whales are, in other words, long-term holders of bitcoin, not doing anything with their holdings even when the rest of the market is selling off heavily. Perhaps even more interesting is that the whales that are considered active traders were largely trading “against the herd,” thus smoothing out market movements both to the upside and downside.  According to the firm, this was particularly true during the major price declines of December 2017 and throughout 2018, when the largest traders were in fact net buyers of bitcoin, providing crucial support to a market that was otherwise dominated by smaller retail traders and hobby investors.",-330.5,0

The company has over 30,000 couriers, and has been described by the North American media as a “Latin American tech unicorn.” Per Argentina-based media outlet Infobae, Rappi decided to roll out Bitcoin pay following a customer survey of its Colombian users – although it has not yet reveled exactly when the service will become available, or what sort of payment platform it will use. Rappi’s popularity has skyrocketed in Columbia since it was founded in the country three years ago. Per Axios and Techcrunch, the company “raised more than USD 200 million” in August this year, in a new funding at “a valuation north of USD 1 billion.” Major investors include the likes of Hong Kong-based DST Global, as well as American venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. Thus far, it appears Rappi will only be offering Bitcoin pay options to its Colombian customers. However, the company is also extremely popular in Mexico, where experts have recently claimed that crypto usage will be mainstream “by 2020 or 2021.” Infobae states that some 50% of Rappi’s sales are made in Mexico City.  The e-commerce platform is also active in Argentina – where cryptocurrencies are rapidly gaining popularity, with dozens of Bitcoin ATMs now being installed across the country. Rappi also operates in Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. As well as traditional e-commerce retail, the company also offers a range of quirkier services, such as courier-delivered ATM cash withdrawals and dog walking.

The study, dubbed The Future of Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin & Altcoin Trends & Challenges 2018-2023, pointed to the fact that daily bitcoin transaction volumes have fallen from around 360,000 per day in late 2017, to 230,000 as of September 2018. According to the researchers, worsening economic conditions internationally this year should be favorable for alternative currencies like Bitcoin, considering events such as the decline of several fiat currencies due to global trade tensions, Brexit, and currency-crises in several developing countries including Turkey, Argentina, and Venezuela. As these events so far have failed to translate into higher crypto prices, Juniper concluded that “it is unlikely to prosper as and when these issues are resolved.” “Like any asset, it is worth whatever someone is prepared to pay for it, but it has no meaning or existence beyond the confines of the ledger. It is a bubble, and there is a strong possibility that this bubble could burst in the near future,” report author Dr. Windsor Holden claimed, adding that “bitcoin has no intrinsic value.”  “In short, given our concerns around both the innate valuation of bitcoin, and of the operating practices of many exchanges, we feel that the industry is on the brink of an implosion,” he said in a white paper accompanying Juniper's research. Also, according to Holden, there is a decline in the base of individuals who are willing to pay inflated prices for cryptocurrencies, credit card companies have banned customers from paying for bitcoin on a card, and social media sites have banned initial coin offering advertising: ""Taken together, this means that there is likely to be less demand, with less funds available to invest in Bitcoin."" However, recent news may show a bit different perspective. For example, David Swensen, chief investment officer at Yale University, who by many is considered the most influential investor in the world, has now reportedly invested in two crypto-focused venture funds. Also, Coinbase, the US-based fiat-to-crypto exchange and wallet service, is reportedly valued at USD 8 billion and in talks with Tiger Global, an investment firm, for up to USD 500 million. This is a sure sign that the industry is more than just “tulips,” according to famous Bitcoin bull Michael Novogratz. Meanwhile, a recent informal poll by Fundstrat Global Advisors, a Wall Street research company, indicated that the usually very cautious Wall Street investors are now overwhelmingly calling a bottom in the bitcoin market. Twitter users, however, are still skeptical, with a majority saying bitcoin still has room to fall. In the past, Juniper Research has also published research painting a more nuanced picture of the cryptocurrency market. In September, the firm found that 64% of respondents in a survey said their company was already actively engaged in, or considering, various blockchain related initiatives, marking a significant increase from the 34% of companies that said the same thing last year.

The country “threatens the security, stability, and viability of Bitcoin” with its “political and economic control over domestic [cryptocurrency] activity, and control over its internet infrastructure,” shows the study from Princeton and Florida International Universities. The research paper, titled The Looming Threat of China: An Analysis of Chinese Influence on Bitcoin, goes on to explain: “As the value and economic utility of Bitcoin have grown, so has the incentive to attack it. We singled out China for analysis because they are the most powerful potential adversary to Bitcoin, and we found that they have a variety of salient motives for attacking the system and a number of mature capabilities, both regulatory and technical, to carry out those attacks.” The Bitcoin mining system is “heavily centralized,” the study goes on to say, as “over 80% of Bitcoin mining is performed by six mining pools,” with five of those managed directly by individuals or companies based in China. This could make a 51% attack viable, as the combined effort of Chinese mining pools accounts for 74% of Bitcoin’s hash power (or computing power). “This is a significant share of the global hashrate – more than controlled by any other single country – but the precise quantity is unknown,” the study adds. ____ “If the Chinese government assumed control of domestic hash power, this property would grant them an advantage in selecting blocks for the ledger, which is important for some types of attacks.” The research defines four attack classes: censorship, deanonymization, weakening consensus, disruption to competing mining operations. In total, the academics identified 19 different attacks currently available to Chinese mining pools. Ideologically, China might even be incentivized to try to destroy Bitcoin, given its centralized regime of totalitarian communism. Even worse than outright destroying it, China might weaponize its control over Bitcoin in order destabilize foreign economies, the researchers believe. However, some in the crypto community disagrees. Reddit user u/igadjeed calls the idea of the mining pools banding together to destroy Bitcoin “academic racism,” adding: “The fallacy here is - because it happens in China, the Government can control it.” They go on to explain, “The blatant fallacy here is - mining pools control miners. There are hundreds of thousands of miners in the ‘Chinese’ mining pools, and most of them are not in China. If there was authoritarian coercion of pool managers, the miners would most likely abandon those pools. Yes, the concentration of pool managers in China is a centralisation issue. Currently, the pools do not censor which transactions get included in a block, except that transaction fees influence choice of transactions, as they always have [but] mining centralisation issues are mostly mitigated by the fact that miners are independent operators. If a pool becomes corruptly managed, the miners will choose a different pool.” The paper has not yet been peer reviewed, so its findings should be taken with a grain of salt.",-10.4399999999996,0

Experts say the move could save investors big money on their tax bills. Per media outlet Calcalist, Roland Am-Shalem, the Deputy Director General of the Israel Tax Authority (ITA), told a Tel Aviv blockchain conference that investors would instead be allowed to choose to how they pay their taxes rather than using the FIFO calculation method – which critics say often over-taxes investors. Am-Shalem stated that investors could opt out of FIFO taxation calculations, which match the value of the assets of tokens to those that are most recently purchased. FIFO calculations are essentially estimations – used in cases where tax authorities have trouble estimating the precise value of assets. Cryptocurrencies are recognized as “assets” in Israel, meaning they have financial value – but not as “currencies,” which can lead to legal confusion over their precise worth. Some experts say the imprecise nature of FIFO accountancy has resulted in Israeli investors paying hefty bills on their crypto earnings, but the new announcement could potentially do away with this. Media outlet The Marker quotes former ITA deputy chief Gidi Bar Zakay as saying, that doing away with FIFO will let investors instead “calculate their cryptocurrency profits accurately, resulting in a real tax calculation.”  This, says Bar Zakay, will “lead to profits worth hundreds of millions of shekels [1 ILS = 0.27 USD] over the years.” Am-Shalem, however, insisted that such “real tax calculation” declarations would need to be backed up with proof – like blockchain-verified times and dates of purchase. He also insisted that such calculations would need to show “consistency” if they were to be accepted. The move has been welcomed by crypto experts in the country. The Marker quotes an accountant specializing in cryptocurrency matters as saying that flexibility will allow many investors to pay less tax. The accountant said, “Quite a few of our customers have actually received tax rebates using the FIFO method.” The accountant concluded that Am-Shalem’s announcement would allow investors and their accountants to choose a preferred calculation method based on their own individual situations.

The university’s chief investor has become something of a legend over the years as his investment success on behalf of the university has been compared to that of Warren Buffett, also known as “The Oracle of Omaha.” Swensen, who by many is considered the most influential investor in the world, has now invested in two crypto-focused venture funds, anonymous sources told several media outlets over the weekend. The first investment is reportedly in the new USD 300 million crypto fund by Silicon Valley investment powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz. The second investment was reported to have been made in Paradigm, another new crypto fund started by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, former partner at venture capital giant Sequoia Capital Matt Huang, and former Pantera Capital employee Charles Noyes. The reason the news is so significant is largely due to Swensen’s track record as one of the most consistent outperformers in the world of professional money management. He has successfully managed Yale University’s USD 29.4 billion endowment fund since 1985, when the fund was just over USD 1 billion.  In a tweet from former Wall Street banker Mike Novogratz on Friday, he summed up the sentiment  by explaining that Swensen is effectively saying that “bitcoin is a store of value,” while calling him “the alpha bull of the herd.” This is really big news.

Yale University manages the second largest college endowment in the US, only behind Harvard. Over the past 20 years, Swensen has returned an average annual return of close to 12%.

Traders rely on volatility to make their money, and with less volatility, there are fewer opportunities to trade. For long-term holders and users of bitcoin, however, it’s a very different story, and low volatility is generally seen as a sign the bitcoin market is maturing. According to Gil Luria, research director at wealth management firm D.A. Davidson & Co., the recently stable bitcoin prices means that there is less speculation in the bitcoin economy. “When speculators are involved, they drive unusually high volumes as well as volatility by trading the asset with high frequency. As speculator involvement is diminished, volumes go down and volatility goes down as well,” Luria told Bloomberg. The same sentiment was also echoed by Mike McGlone, commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, explaining that bitcoin is now exhibiting signs of a “maturing market, so volatility should continue to decline.” “When you have a new market, it will be highly volatile until it establishes itself. There are more participants, more derivatives, more ways of trading, hedging and arbitraging,” McGlone said. Judging from the data, it appears the experts are right that both trading volume and volatility is down. Although most notably for bitcoin, the data confirms that the same is also true for many other cryptocurrencies. The unusually low volatility in bitcoin is confirmed by a technical indicator known as the Average True Range (ATR) indicator, as seen in the bottom of the chart below. Looking on a day-by-day basis, volatility in the bitcoin market is now down to levels not seen since July 2017, before the huge run-up in prices seen later that year. Although volatility may be low at the moment, bitcoin’s price chart looks like it is about to break-out from a massive chart pattern that has been forming since the beginning of this year. Judging from the pattern seen above, with lower highs but a floor around the USD 6,000 mark, it appears that bitcoin is about to face another battle between bulls and bears that will determine its next move. As we have seen throughout 2018, the selling pressure has been heavy on bitcoin, but buyers have consistently shown up at USD 6,000 to support the market. Over time, sellers have become exhausted as they have not been able to drive the price further down, and we have seen lower volatility as a result. The next few weeks may give us an indication of which side is stronger in the fourth quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, a new informal poll indicated that the usually very cautious Wall Street investors are now overwhelmingly calling a bottom in the bitcoin market.

Twitter users, however, are still skeptical, with a majority saying bitcoin still has room to fall. The firm had polled 25 financial institutions during a private dinner, and compared the results with 9,500 individual Twitter users.  When and at what price will Bitcoin bottom? ___ Among the institutions, 57% said they believe each bitcoin will be worth anywhere between USD 15,000 and “the moon” by the end of 2019. Among Twitter users, however, only 40% shared the same view. Where is Bitcoin's USD price by YE 2018 and YE 2019? ___ Fundstrat’s survey further revealed that 59% of institutions identified bitcoin (BTC) as their favorite coin out of 15 coins shown, while 46% of Twitter users said Ripple’s XRP was their favorite token. XRP, however, was also named the “most polarizing token” in the survey results, and no institutions chose it as their favorite.  Which top 15 tokens will be the best and worst performing in 2019? ___ ___ Which of the 15 token's investment thesis makes the least sense? Further, the firm asked participants whether they believed cryptocurrency prices would rise during a recession. Important to note here is that a majority of the institutional respondents did not believe we will see a recession in the next 18 months. If a recession does happen, however, 72% of institutions polled believed that crypto prices would rise.  Will cryptocurrency prices rise if there is a recession? ___ What is the most important macro factor influencing crypto prices? Some members of crypto community, such as Tone Vays, a trader and analyst, however, are not convinced, expressing the contrarian investment viewpoint that the majority is always wrong about market movements. The majority is wrong... Yes, the majority is ALWAYS wrong... I call it the 'stupidity' of the crowd. Thank you @fundstrat for proving that #Bitcoin falls in a recession & that $BTCUSD will NOT bottom till Mid 2019! pic.twitter.com/wXEv7fnY7f In conclusion, the firm said bitcoin is likely to “meaningfully outperform” other coins on the market between now and year end 2019, given the institutional preference for the coin and the expected inflow of capital from new initiatives, including the upcoming Bakkt app.  Meanwhile, former Wall Street banker and now-famous crypto bull Mike Novogratz, this week expressed a more cautiously optimistic view of the number one cryptocurrency, telling participants at the Economist Finance Disrupted seminar in New York that he does not believe bitcoin will break the USD 9,000 level this year.  In comparison, a month ago, Tom Lee reaffirmed his USD 20,000 bitcoin price target for the end of the year. Overall, bitcoin prices have in recent months become less and less volatile, and have largely traded in a range between USD 6,000 and USD 8,000 since May of this year. Since early September, that range has become even tighter, keeping prices between the USD 6,200 and USD 6,800 levels, as the market is waiting for a breakout in the bitcoin price.",48.32999999999993,1

Binance has struck a deal with TravelbyBit, a Queensland-based company that provides blockchain technology-powered payments solutions for travel industry companies. Per a joint press release, Binance and its new partner will look to create blockchain-powered point-of-sale (POS) payment systems at major airports around the world. Caleb Yeoh, CEO of TravelbyBit, claimed, “We’re working with the most innovative airports and retailers who want to offer their consumers non-traditional payment options.” Earlier this year, the company announced that ""travelers from all over the world are now able to pay using digital currency at Brisbane Airport, the world’s first digital currency airport."" As part of TravelbyBit’s payment system, the merchants at Brisbane Airport range from restaurants to souvenir shops and cater to all guests arriving and departing through the airport’s international terminal. TravelbyBit’s existing payment platform currently supports transactions in Bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin. Under the terms of the investment deal, the Australian company will also add support for the Binance Coin token to its platform. The state of Queensland, which had previously handed TravelbyBit a USD 71,000 business growth grant, has expressed its support for the deal. Per the press release, Queensland’s Minister for Innovation and Tourism Kate Jones stated, “It is great to see a local company partnering with one of the most established multinational companies in the blockchain ecosystem.” The startup has reportedly partnered with more than 150 merchants across Australia to accept digital currencies, and is looking to use the new investment to expand their reach across the country and turn Australia into a more crypto-friendly travel destination for people from around the world. In January, TravelbyBit published a story about Robert, an eighty-year-old Singaporean Bitcoin investor, who traveled Australia on crypto.",78.77999999999975,1

Reuters reports that a company named Athena Bitcoin, which late last month installed the country’s first Bitcoin ATM at a Buenos Aires shopping mall, says it will install a total of 30 machines in Argentina before the year’s end. The same media outlet also reports that an American company named Odyssey Group hopes to install a further 150 ATMs “at the end of the year,” with a view to having 80% of the machines fully operational “at the beginning of 2019.” Odyssey Group says its ATMs will also allow customers to make conventional bank transactions. The move will be Odyssey Group’s first foray into Latin America, but Reuters quotes the company as saying it is increasingly looking to expand its activities across the entire region. Athena Bitcoin already operates 12 ATMs in Colombia, as well as a machine in Mexico. The company says it hopes to expand its operations to Chile and Brazil. A company spokesperson said the machines – which currently only allow customers to conduct Bitcoin transactions – will be modified in the future, allowing for transactions in other tokens, such as Litecoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash. Argentina’s peso has been in freefall for much of 2018, with massive interest rate hikes doing nothing to stop its decline. In May, the country’s president asked the International Monetary Fund for a USD 50 billion loan – however, citizens are increasingly transferring their assets into foreign currencies and digital tokens as confidence in the peso continues to suffer. Data from LocalBitcoins, a peer-to-peer bitcoin marketplace, shows that weekly bitcoin trading volume on this marketplace is more than 20 bitcoins over the past few months.  As reported by Cryptonews.com, the number of crypto ATMs in the world is rising steadily, and that they're enjoying increased usage from customers. Still, the legal status of crypto is preventing their growth from being as impressive as it could be, while stubbornly high fees are placing a limit on customer usage.

The current market sentiment is neutral-to-bearish as long as bitcoin is trading below the USD 6,800 resistance. Altcoins like bitcoin cash and QTUM are showing positive signs and may perhaps continue to climb higher in the short term. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin price remained above the USD 6,500 support with a positive angle. However, there were multiple rejections noted around the USD 6,650 resistance in BTC/USD. At present, the price is trading flat near the USD 6,580 level with an immediate resistance at USD 6,620 and USD 6,650.
If buyers gain momentum above the USD 6,650 resistance, the price is likely to revisit the USD 6,800 resistance zone. On the other hand, the USD 6,500 level is a strong support, below which there is a risk of more declines towards the USD 6,400 and USD 6,320 support levels. Ethereum price remained confined in tiny range above the USD 220 level. ETH/USD seems to be facing a tough resistance near the USD 235 level, above which there are chances of a fresh rally towards the USD 250 level.
On the flip side, if sellers push the price below the USD 220 support, the price will most likely trade towards the USD 205 support in the near term. Bitcoin cash price is currently up more than 1% and is trading above the USD 540 support. BCH/USD needs to break the USD 560 resistance to climb further towards the USD 600 level. On the downside, supports are visible near the USD 540 and USD 520 levels.
Ripple price struggled to clear the USD 0.600 resistance and declined. XRP/USD is currently down more than 3% and is trading near the USD 0.560 level. The main supports are at USD 0.550 and USD 0.532. A few altcoins climbed higher today, including cortex, FUN, NEM, IOST, ELA, ELF, ETN, SC and BCN. Out of these, cortex rallied around 24% and FUN gained more than 12%.
To sum up, bitcoin price is showing a few bearish signs below the USD 6,650 and USD 6,800 resistance levels. Buyers need to soon jump into action to push the price above the USD 6,800 barrier. If not, there is a risk of a bearish reaction in BTC/USD and altcoins in the coming sessions.

The demand for Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies continues to rise this year, as the country’s dollar, the bolivar, continues to drop. Venezuela has hit crisis mode extreme, but can BTC save them? According to Coin Dance, Venezuelan residents’ interest in Bitcoin (BTC) reached its peak in July of this year. Most countries have declined since January of 2018, when the total crypto market hit its all-time high. In December, BTC hit just under $20,000 a coin, and altcoins hit record-highs the first week of January. Since then, the crypto market has dropped $500 billion in value. The interest recently in Bitcoin by the residents in Venezuela at this time is rather shocking. However, with the country’s economic downfall, it seems its residents are doing anything to try and survive in their country. According to the International Organization for Migration, since the year 2015, around 1.6 million people had fled from Venezuela. Many have fled to other South American countries such as Peru, Brazil, Argentina, and Columbia. >> Malta Prime Minister: Cryptocurrency is the “Inevitable Future of Money” Back on August 10th, five zeros were dropped from the country’s currency after its inflation levels had risen to stratospheric levels. The country rolled out a ‘new’ and revamped currency just after this and its inflation rose 100% in just three weeks, the Financial Express reported. At this time, investments in BTC remained at record-highs around the country. Other than devaluing the country’s currency by 100% and renaming it to the sovereign bolivar, the country’s president, Nicola Maduro, announced his oil-backed cryptocurrency that would be pegged to the new Bolivar. This was in hopes to go around sanctions and gain access to international finances to get the inflation under control. Many within Venezuela felt this was illegal and many countries urged their banks not to buy Venezuelan debt. Despite Maduro making strong efforts to push his Petro coin, interest has dropped dramatically, and residents are still sticking to Bitcoin (BTC).

BTC/USD recovered steadily and moved back above the USD 6,500 resistance. Similarly, major altcoins like ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash completed a short-term downside correction and later bounced back. Having said that, buyers are currently facing important resistances like USD 6,800 for BTC/USD and USD 235 for ETH/USD. If there is a successful break above the stated resistances, the market could climb further higher into the positive zone. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin price failed on more than two occasions near the USD 6,800 resistance. BTC/USD corrected lower towards USD 6,400 where it found support and later recovered above the USD 6,500 and 6,550 resistance levels. 
The price is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) trading near the USD 6,600 level with an immediate resistance at USD 6,650. Above this, the price will most likely trade towards the USD 6,750 and USD 6,800 resistance levels. On the downside, the key weekly supports are USD 6,400 and 6,320. Ethereum price stayed above the important USD 200 support. ETH/USD cleared the USD 215 and 220 resistance levels, but buyers seem to be struggling near a crucial hurdle at USD 235.
If buyers surpass the USD 235 barrier, there could be decent gains towards the USD 244 and 250 levels. On the downside, the main supports are visible near USD 215 and USD 200. Bitcoin cash price failed to break the USD 600 resistance and corrected lower. BCH/USD is currently trading well above the USD 500 support with an immediate resistance at USD 550. Above USD 550, buyers are likely to take control for a push towards the USD 600 weekly resistance.
Ripple price is down around 1.5% to USD 0.580. XRP/USD recently spiked above the USD 0.600 level, but buyers failed to keep the price above the stated level. On the downside, the main weekly supports are at USD 0.572 and USD 0.550, and resistances are USD 0.600 and USD 0.620.

On the downside, the previous resistances near USD 6,600 and USD 6,500 are likely to act as supports if the price corrects lower. Ethereum price finally managed to gain strength above the USD 215 resistance. ETH/USD gained more than 8% and tested the next resistance at USD 230. Above this, the price may climb towards the USD 240 level.

This time, two good news for crypto adoption, announced by Coinbase and Google was not enough to excite crypto traders, who continued to sell off holdings of bitcoin and major altcoins on Wednesday, which marked the fifth straight day of losses for bitcoin.  With the exception of Ripple’s XRP, which surged more than 10% in early Wednesday trading, most of all top 50 coins by market capitalization were in the red for the last 24 hours. In a statement published by Coinbase on Tuesday, the popular US-based fiat-to-crypto exchange announced a new listing process for new digital assets, while saying that their goal is to “rapidly list all assets” that meets their standards. The new statement marks a turnaround for Coinbase, which in the past has been hesitant to list new digital assets on its platform, and for a long time sticking with only bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin as alternatives for their users to invest in. Now, however, it appears that the exchange has finally secured the regulatory assurances it needs to list more assets, even as their listing process becomes simplified. According to the exchange, this becomes possible by making some of the new assets available for users in a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction manner, meaning users in different regions may not necessarily have access to the same assets. Also worth pointing out is that unlike other exchanges that may charge up to USD 1 million to list a new asset, Coinbase said their application process will be free of charge to begin with. In other news from Tuesday, Google said it has once again opened up for ads with crypto-related content in the US and Japan, after placing a ban earlier this year. This time, however, it is treading more carefully, allowing only certain regulated crypto exchanges to advertise using its tools.  Google’s decision follows a similar move from Facebook in July this year, when it said that it will allow crypto-related ads from pre-approved companies.
____ As reported on Monday, as the crypto market has become less sensitive to hype, and investors, speculators have largely held on to their positions over the summer, the bitcoin market will make a major move, for better or worse, only in response to a fundamental change, according to a new research from blockchain analysis company Chainalysis.",42.210000000000036,1

Regulations, new use cases, and developments in technology are possible drivers for the next move in prices, the authors of the research said. “The first challenge of adoption —getting cryptocurrency into people’s hands— has been overcome, but we are now waiting to see what the next stage of adoption looks like,” they added.  The authors suggested that the remarkably stable amount of speculative coins could be indicative of “a market less sensitive to hype,” and that individual news stories no longer affect bitcoin prices to the same extent as they did during the 2017 rally when many new participants entered the market. For example, an interesting thing about the bitcoin rally last week was that the price increased nearly 8% despite news coverage that would normally be considered negative. “The market seems to have recalibrated after the entry of so many new market participants with different beliefs and expectations than those who held bitcoin prior to 2017,” according to the research. Also, both long-term investors and speculators in the bitcoin market have largely held on to their positions over the summer, helping maintain relatively stable bitcoin prices, even as some altcoins have fallen sharply. The research revealed that the number of bitcoins held by speculators has remained stable from May to August this year, at around 22% of the total bitcoin supply. Meanwhile, longer-term investors accounted for 30% of the coin supply over the same time period. To conduct the study, Chainalysis divided the total bitcoin supply of 21 million BTC into five categories depending on how liquid the coins are, or how often they move, ranging from “speculative coins” that are traded often, to “investment coins,” and lastly “lost and unmined coins.”",-157.17000000000007,0

The most interesting thing to note about the rally, however, is that it has come without any obvious fundamental drivers to point to, and despite news coverage that would normally be considered negative for the bitcoin price. As seasoned traders and investors know, it is often considered a very bullish sign when an asset increases in price despite negative news coverage. It shows that the upward momentum is strong, and that there are buyers standing by in the market, ready to buy up even the slightest dip in price. This Sunday, Travis Kling, founder of the new crypto hedge fund Ikigai, on Twitter echoed the sentiment that bear markets normally don’t respond positively to negative news events. You can't ignore the market's lack of negative reaction to the CVE vulnerability announced a couple days ago.That's not what bear markets do. Bear markets ignore positive news events and overemphasize negative news events. Beginnings of a regime change?https://t.co/cJNnrSsBgs In the tweet, Kling referred to a recently discovered bitcoin bug, disclosed in an official Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) report from Bitcoin Core developers. According to the report, an attacker could potentially have exploited the bug to mine invalid blocks, essentially creating new bitcoins beyond the 21 million BTC cap. Despite this serious bug and the warning that there is a small chance of a chainsplit, bitcoin continued its week-long grind higher. Another news story that bitcoin hodlers and traders alike took note of this past week was that we will likely have to wait even longer for the first bitcoin-backed exchange traded fund (ETF) to be approved in the US. In a notice published online, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked for more comments from the public in connection with a proposal to list an ETF backed by “physical” bitcoin by financial firm VanEck. The SEC also made it clear that it needs more time to reach a decision on whether to approve the proposal. Again, the price of bitcoin reacted to the news by trading higher, adding nearly 2% on the day the news was released, before surging close to 4% on the following day. Despite widespread speculation that the ETF may not be approved until March next year, some members of the community attributed the gains to the fact that the language of the official notice was more positive than earlier. In addition, the SECs decision to ask for more comments was largely seen as a positive development, signaling a willingness by the regulator to learn more about the bitcoin market. Perhaps, most entertaining this past week was a show-down between a number of cryptocurrency exchanges and New York’s attorney general.  In a statement, attorney general Barbara D. Underwood blasted cryptocurrency exchanges Binance, Kraken, and Gate.io for failing to provide information requested by her office. She added that the three exchanges have been referred to the New York State Department of Financial Services for “possibly operating unlawfully in New York.” CEO of Kraken Exchange, Jesse Powell, posted a response on Twitter saying that “NY is that abusive, controlling ex you broke up with 3 years ago”, reminding that the exchange is not operating in New York. NY is that abusive, controlling ex you broke up with 3 years ago but they keep stalking you, throwing shade on your new relationships, unable to accept that you have happily moved on and are better off without them. #getoverit https://t.co/DC5S1WyRnp Once again, bitcoin traders appeared unaffected and reacted by sending the coin higher both on the day of the news and the next day. Lastly, Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Zaif became the victim of yet another exchange hacking scandal this past week. In the early hours of September 20, the company issued a statement saying that its network had been compromised by hackers four days earlier. According to the statement, hackers got away with 5,966 BTC, worth approximately USD 40 million, from users’ hot wallets on the exchange. Also, it appears as if the exchange first tried to cover up the hack from its users, saying on September 17 that it had suspended withdrawals and deposits due to “sever failure.” Currently, in addition to BTC and MONA, BCH deposit / withdrawal is suspended due to server failure. We are investigating for recovery. Please refrain from depositing / withdrawing money.Moreover, settlement by ZaifPayment is also stopped. We’re sorry for the inconvenience. As became known three days later, however, the real reason for the suspension was a security breach. Despite this, bitcoin traders didn’t seem to care, sending the number one cryptocurrency surging another 3.9% for the day. So, if following the news makes you confused about what the market is doing, perhaps it is better to instead listen to the words of the legendary American stock investor Jesse Livermore, who once said: “Markets are never wrong but opinions often are.”",-109.36000000000058,0

Total market capitalization: Bitcoin price topped recently near the USD 6,850 level and corrected below USD 6,740. BTC/USD is down around 1% with an immediate support near the USD 6,600 level. Below this, the weekly supports are visible near the USD 6,520 and USD 6,400 levels.
On the flip side, if the price continues to move higher, the USD 6,850 resistance could stop upsides. Above this, bitcoin buyers may perhaps attempt a clear break above the USD 7,000 level. Ethereum price failed to settle above the USD 250 resistance and is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) trading below the USD 240 level. On the downside, ETH/USD might find support near the USD 222 and USD 210 levels.
Once the current correction wave is over, the price may revisit the USD 250 zone. On the upside, a break above the USD 250 weekly resistance could trigger more gains towards the USD 275 level. Bitcoin cash price failed to stay above the USD 500 level and is currently down more than 2%. BCH/USD may possibly correct further towards the USD 450 support level, below which sellers could regain control. On the upside, the USD 500 and USD 510 levels are crucial hurdles.
Ripple price is down around 3%, but it is still trading above the USD 0.500 support. XRP/USD may clear the USD 0.580 resistance to trade past USD 0.600 and USD 0.620 in the near term. During the past few sessions, a few altcoins corrected lower between 5% - 8%, including IOTA, bitcoin diamond, DGD, DRGN, PIVX, BNT, XMR, MAID, POWR and MKR. Overall, bitcoin is trading with a positive bias above the USD 6,400 weekly support. However, buyers need to push the price above USD 6,850 and USD 7,000 resistances for more gains. If not, there is a risk of a fresh downward move towards USD 6,400 or even USD 6,200. Similarly, ethereum must stay above USD 200 to bounce back in the coming days. _____",-109.36000000000058,0

Now, they add that while the bug has been fixed, there is still a small chance of a chainsplit within the next week or so. The initial patch notes state that, “A denial-of-service vulnerability (CVE-2018-17144) exploitable by miners has been discovered in Bitcoin Core versions 0.14.0 up to 0.16.2. It is recommended to upgrade any of the vulnerable versions to 0.16.3 as soon as possible.” Anyone willing to exploit this bug, however, would have to sacrifice a block reward of 12.5 BTC (more than USD 80,000) to do so.  Although this may seem far-fetched, other possible (and maybe even probable) issues present themselves: a chainsplit, which occurs when two or more versions of a blockchain exist at any one time. All competing versions share an identical history up until the point at which they split. Currently, incompatibilities between different versions of full node software could trigger a chainsplit.  “There is currently a small risk of a chainsplit. In a chainsplit, transactions could be reversed long after they are fully confirmed,” the developers warn, adding, “Therefore, for the next week or so you should consider there to be a small possibility of any transaction with less than 200 confirmations being reversed.” However, they also promise to keep the community updated and add that if a chainsplit should happen, “action may be required.” Currently, double-spending presents the biggest challenge, as there is still a way to try to double-spend, as explained in a full disclosure statement that the developers published. Still, the post adds, “At this time we believe over half of the Bitcoin hashrate [or computing power] has upgraded to patched nodes. We are unaware of any attempts to exploit this vulnerability. However, it still remains critical that affected users upgrade and apply the latest patches to ensure no possibility of large reorganizations, mining of invalid blocks, or acceptance of invalid transactions occurs.”

At the Yahoo Finance’s All Markets Summit, Novogratz called the crypto price rally of December 2017 “the first global speculative mania ever,” and added that, “Like with any mania, [things] got crazy.”  In terms of adoption, he talked about Bakkt, a heavyweight crypto platform in development, and reminded that Microsoft and Starbucks are partners there, which could drive the companies to start accepting cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. ""You're all going to start using Bitcoin to buy coffee of games soon enough,"" Novogratz said (04:10), adding that “Bitcoin is, I think, going to have a renaissance here soon.” Highlight: Galaxy Investment Partners CEO Mike @novogratz calls the cryptocurrency boom in late 2017 ""the first global speculative mania ever. ...

As a leader in Mobile Pay to our more than 15 million Starbucks Rewards members, Starbucks is committed to innovation for expanding payment options for our customers.” The company later clarified that customers will not be paying directly with bitcoin, but that the company has joined forces with other well-known brands to create a platform to “convert digital assets like Bitcoin into US dollars, which can be used at Starbucks.” “However, we will continue to talk with customers and regulators as the space evolves,” they concluded.

However, in contrast to previous delays, this time Bitcoin advanced by more than 2% in the last 24% hours. This marks the fourth straight day of gains for bitcoin, bringing it back above the short-term resistance level of USD 6,500 on the chart. The SEC, the agency tasked with approving or disapproving new ETF applications in the US, wrote in the note that it encourages interested persons to provide comments in the weeks ahead, before a final decision will be made. It went on to list 18 detailed questions about statements made in the ETF proposal that it asked to public to comment on. Among questions asked were things like people’s view on whether the bitcoin market is less susceptible to manipulation than other commodities that ETFs typically hold, and whether surveillance and market monitoring by exchanges is sufficient to prevent and detect fraudulent trading activities. The proposal in question was originally filed by VanEck with the help of the Chicago Board Options Exchange on June 6 this year, but any decision on it can be delayed a number of times under current regulations, giving the SEC until early next year to reach a decision.

Total market capitalization: Bitcoin price traded above the USD 6,550 resistance, but sellers defended more gains. BTC/USD is down to USD 6,400 and it is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) trading in a range. An immediate support on the downside is near the USD 6,300 level, followed by the USD 6,250 level.
If the price moves higher, it could find sellers near the USD 6,440 level. Above this, the price may perhaps rise back towards the USD 6,500 barrier. Ethereum price dipped below the USD 200 level during the last decline, but it quickly recovered. ETH/USD is currently trading well above the USD 200 support.
Buyers need to push the price above the USD 215 resistance to initiate a fresh upward move. The next resistance above USD 215 is at USD 225, above which the price may test the USD 240 level. Bitcoin cash price is struggling to hold gains above the USD 420 support. BCH/USD must stay above the USD 400 and USD 420 supports to bounce back.

To retain a different perspective, we have made a comparison of the amount of bad news versus good news in the crypto space within the past month. However, it's nearly impossible to mention all the news, but the results show the general trend - regardless of price, crypto is a hub of positivity. In either case, let's start with the bad news first. 1. Possibly the first example that comes to mind is Goldman Sachs postponing crypto trading desk plans - although this turned out to be false, but the damage had already been done.  2. The news of ShapeShift, one of the best known platforms offering peer-to-peer trading of digital assets, introducing KYC (know your customer) procedures did not sit well with Bitcoin maximalists, who are now scared that privacy and pseudonymity are endangered. 3. Trouble loomed in other crypto exchanges as well: Star Xu, the creator of OKEx operator OKCoin seems to have had some sort of contact with the Chinese police. The amount of uncertainty surrounding this case has proven fertile ground for speculations and FUD. 4. Meanwhile, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, has met with criticism by the community after claiming that ETH will be worthless unless there are some changes in the protocol. This claim was followed by him saying that, “There isn’t an opportunity for yet another 1,000-times growth in anything in the space anymore,” which the community did not take well to either.  5. The platform connecting blockchain believers to teams that are building serious blockchain businesses Cofound.it has announced that it is closing down.  6. Russia may seek to cap crypto investments. 7. In August initial coin offering (ICO) funding has meaningfully slowed to a bit over USD 326 million. Last time ICOs raised less than USD 300 million in a month was May of 2017. 8. The worst news, however, were the prices throughout the past month. The crypto plunge has exceeded the dot-com crash of 2000 (again), which prompted naysayers to come out and show their distrust.  But while people are preoccupied checking coin prices obsessively, the cryptoverse has scored some significant victories.  1,2,3. Most recently, we wrote about three great news in one: the Winklevoss twins winning regulatory approval for their cryptocurrency, US banking giant Citigroup dipping into crypto, and the Vice President of the European Commission saying that “crypto is here to stay.” 4. Australia is also going forward in their crypto adoption: Two fintech startups have teamed up to let Aussies pay their bills using crypto. 5. Asian countries are not lagging behind, either. The Philippines are taking steps towards regulation as well: the country is looking to become more crypto-friendly. 6,7. Uzbekistan is already aiming for a high position in crypto-friendly regulatory environments, while Japan is giving another chance to Coinbase and other cryptocurrency exchanges.  8. An Iranian news agency claimed that the country has given the green light to cryptocurrency mining, with more crypto-friendly measures and legislation to follow. 9. Also, a Hong Kong company is set to issue 100,000 “cryptocurrency Visa debit cards” over the next two months, in what it claims will be a first for Asia. 10. Other financial institutions have not rejected crypto and blockchain completely. The world’s first public blockchain-based bond generated “overwhelming” interest, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia claimed. 11. Another banking giant, Morgan Stanley is reportedly preparing to offer bitcoin swap trading for clients, joining other top banks in a sectorwide effort to explore digital currencies, according to Bloomberg, who cites sources familiar with the matter. 12. Heavyweight crypto platform Bakkt announced that with their solution, the buying and selling of Bitcoin is fully collateralized or pre-funded. ""As such, our new daily Bitcoin contract will not be traded on margin, use leverage, or serve to create a paper claim on a real asset. This supports market integrity and differentiates our effort from existing futures and crypto exchanges."" According to Mike Novogratz, a former hedge-fund manager who is heavily invested in digital currencies, Bakkt might be the most important news in crypto this year. 13. And if you really don’t care about institutional adoption but would like to accept Bitcoin in your business, CoinGate and Lightning Network teamed up to help you. Shoppers are now able to pay with miniscule fees and get instant payment confirmations, while merchants can ship their goods virtually instantly without risk of chargebacks or fraud. 14. The National Assembly, South Korea’s parliament, has begun debating whether the government should overturn a ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs). 15. Are you still worried about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hedging on whether to approve crypto ETFs? The matter has not been forgotten: the popular US-based fiat-to-crypto exchange Coinbase is considering if it should submit a proposal for a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF) on its own, according to reports. Moreover, the digital asset exchange plans to expand its newly opened New York office  to 150 employees next year, from 20 currently, Coindesk reported. 16. ICO projects are starting to deliver on their promises, building their products, especially when they have secured funding for years to come. 17. One of the wealthiest football clubs in the world, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), is teaming up with a Maltese blockchain startup to launch a cryptocurrency for its fans. 18. Elad Roisman, the newly-appointed member of the SEC, becomes second pro-crypto commissionaire at SEC together with Hester Peirce. 19. Julius Baer Group, one of the oldest banking institutions in Switzerland, is reportedly acting as issuer for a cryptocurrency product.  20. Huobi Group, once the biggest cryptocurrency exchange platform in China and the world, expands to Japan via an acquisition of local exchange BitTrade. 21. Nasdaq has announced that it aims to acquire Cinnober, a major Swedish financial technology provider, that is bullish towards crypto and is helping institutional investors to invest in them.  22. Tezos, one of the top 5 ICOs of 2017, announced that its mainnet is finally live.

The research by weekly cryptocurrency publication Diar found that over one third of total bitcoin supply, or 55% of circulating bitcoin sit in wallets (with more than BTC 200 in each) that have never made an outgoing transaction. In addition, 27% of these wallets have continued to accumulate coins during the bear market in anticipation of the next leg up in the bitcoin market. There are also a few possible explanations as to why so many bitcoin wallets have never made any outgoing transactions.  Aside from the fact that some of those walletts are owned by the cryptocurrency exchanges (at least 3.8% of the bitcoin supply is held in 5 such wallets), the most intriguing answer would be that the owners of these wallets are die-hard bitcoin hoarders. It could also be that the private keys to the wallets have been lost, owners have deceased, or through other means have become inaccessible.  According to the article, over 87% of existing bitcoins are stored in wallets with more than 10 bitcoins (worth over USD 60,000 as of press time). However, these fat wallets make up only 0.7% of all bitcoin wallet addresses, indicating that the vast majority of bitcoin wealth is held by a few long-term hodlers. Further, when looking at wallets with over 100 bitcoins, we are down to only 0.1% of all wallet addresses. These wallets hold roughly 62% of all circulating bitcoins. However, according to Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis company, between 2.3 and 3.7 million bitcoins are considered lost, meaning that the circulating bitcoin supply could be anywhere from 13% to 22% lower than official figures (more than 17 million bitcoins.)",90.39000000000033,1

Founded last year by a former investment manager at Goldman Sachs, BlockTower Capital is one fund that has expanded this year, hiring additional staff and opening a second office in New York in addition to its Connecticut headquarters, a source told Bloomberg. BlockTower’s new hires reportedly comes from diverse backgrounds, including venture capital, startup incubators, and investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, Nomura, and Bank of America. Among the fund’s investors is the famous American venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Further, the article went on to cite data from the Eurekahedge Crypto-Currency Hedge Fund Index, which confirms that crypto hedge funds on average has seen a decline in returns of 52.9% this year, compared with the 54% decline in bitcoin. That comes despite the fact that many hedge funds are holding a variety of smaller tokens and altcoins, which have seen even heavier selling this year than bitcoin. The relative outperformance by hedge funds against the broader market this year suggests that the hedging and active trading strategies employed by some of these firms have been working. The Eurekahedge Index is an equally weighted index of 16 hedge funds with positions in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In 2017, the index recorded a 1,709% gain, with an annualized return since inception of 152%. Through July 31, there were 96 new crypto hedge funds and venture capital funds, an annual pace of 165, as reported by Cryptonews.com. This would surpass the record 156 crypto funds launched in 2017. More than half of all crypto funds currently in existence have launched in just the last 18 months, according to Crypto Fund Research, a research company. However, the research goes on to show that while crypto funds are the fastest growing hedge fund strategy by number, overall assets are still quite meager, compared to traditional funds.",90.39000000000033,1

Other coins have largely followed bitcoin higher, and we have seen stable prices and low volatility across the board in the cryptocurrency market. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
The number one cryptocurrency by market cap has seen a decent recovery since the heavy sell-off two weeks ago, when the price plunged from USD 7,400 to USD 6,100 in just four days. In addition, bitcoin has managed to remain well above the lows in the USD 5,800 area from June, a sign that the market has stabilized overall and that the bears may finally have run out of steam.
For bitcoin, the USD 6,600 level marks the immediate resistance to the upside. If that level breaks, the previous market top at around USD 7,400 would become the next major resistance area.
Also, interesting to note about the bitcoin market is that the ratio between short and long trades is still at an unusually high level, according to data from the Bitfinex exchange. As we have seen in the past, a high short-to-long ratio may trigger sharp price increases. Ethereum
Similar to bitcoin, the price of ether has also traded up over the past week, since reaching a bottom of USD 167 on Coinbase on September 12. Following that, the price bounced back, gaining over 15% on September 13 alone.
As demonstrated by the sharp rise on that day, the USD 180 level appears to be an area with significant buying interest, thus creating a floor in the market for Ethereum (at least for now). To the upside, the previous consolidation area between USD 275 and USD 290 acts as the closest resistance level. Ripple
The price of the XRP token has formed what could be an interesting double bottom formation on the daily chart, which is normally a bullish sign. Since reaching the second bottom on September 11, XRP has traded slightly up followed by a sideways consolidation. For the market to indicate a reversal to a bullish trend, a short-term break above the USD 0.37 resistance would be needed. Litecoin
The litecoin market has been stuck in a prolonged downtrend with only very small corrective rallies since May this year. Although the selling has become less intense in recent months, the market has continued to make new lows – the very definition of a downward trend used in technical analysis.
Judging from the charts, Litecoin should break above the previous high around the USD 68 area, followed by a low that is above the previous market low at around USD 50 - USD 55 until we can say that a reversal has happened. Until that happens, the technical outlook on litecoin remains bearish.   _____

One indicator used by technical analysts in the market now shows “oversold” levels, indicating that a rally could follow. The indicator referenced in an article by Bloomberg is the Williams Percent Range, often referred to as Williams %R, which measures momentum in price by identifying overbought and oversold levels with readings between 0 and -100. Over the past week, the indicator has shown readings in oversold territories, below -80, although that has risen slightly to about -70 as of press time. Readings below -80 on the Williams %R have historically been good buying opportunities for bitcoin. The last time the indicator showed similar readings, in early August this year, bitcoin reacted by rallying over 20% during the month (green circle). It is worth noting, however, that technical indicators are prone to give false signals, and therefore should be interpreted with caution.  On Friday, former Wall Street banker turned cryptocurrency entrepreneur Michael Novogratz said that he believes the market has now retraced to the starting point of last year’s “massive rally/bubble,” while pointing out that strong market rallies historically have tended to retrace to the breakout point. Bitcoin price chart last week: Meanwhile, Juan Villaverde, an econometrician and mathematician who leads the Weiss Ratings team of analysts and computer programmers who created Weiss cryptocurrency ratings, suggested that the next bull cycle is still in the making.  According to Villaverde, the first few months of the next bull cycle could be slow and choppy, however, ""the next crash is bound to wipe out at least half of the gains.""  ""But as before, early investors will still come out ahead. Even those who just HODL should be sitting on some fat profits,"" the analyst estimated.",-232.86000000000058,0

Speaking at a blockchain conference in Shibuya, Tokyo this week, GMO representatives talked of the company’s latest mining project – claiming they constructed the facility “somewhere in Scandinavia” (although they refused to specify where) in temperatures as low as -10°C. The company states that despite leaky roofs, the facility is now operational, and mined some 568 bitcoins (USD 3.7 million) by July this year – although it did not disclose how much it had spent on construction costs, electricity bills and other expenses in the same period. Meanwhile, GMO stated that preparing the plant provided a serious challenge, with frequent blizzards, ankle-deep snow, icy roads and heavy rain hampering the building effort. The GMO team has installed 15,000 ASIC mining rigs in two warehouses at the site, with the hardware’s energy consumption roughly equal “to that of 33,500 households.” Per Japanese media outlet Crypto Watch, GMO said they chose Northern Europe because of the region’s low temperatures, which are advantageous for keeping mining equipment cool. The company also cited the fact that Scandinavia has become a leading renewable energy player as a major factor, as well as low electricity costs. According to various analysts, the break-even price for miners is in a range of USD 6.400 and USD 8.000 per bitcoin and varies depending on the miner’s efficiency. As bitcoin hash rate — which measures computing power - is growing, so does mining difficulty. ""The increased hash rate means people are here for the long-term because they’re happy to just accumulate what they have, potentially even run at a loss,” David Sapper, chief operating officer at cryptocurrency exchangeBlockbid Pty Ltd. in Melbourne told Bloomberg last month. At the same time, “they do sometimes have to clear house and dump.” However, Genesis Mining, a giant cloud mining operator, had to terminate customers who are unable to cover their “service fee” because of low mining profitability, as reported in August. GMO considers itself a pioneer in Japanese cryptocurrency, and operates the GMO Coin exchange in addition to mining projects and its IP activities. The firm has also allowed its staff to receive a portion of their wages in cryptocurrencies.

The central bank recently issued a directive on cryptocurrency transactions aimed at “strengthening control” over cryptocurrency trading and online gambling sites. Per Vietnamese news site Zing, the likes of PVComBank and Vietnam International Bank (VIB) are now taking steps, by refusing all cryptocurrency-related withdrawals, transfers and card transactions. According to InfoNet, the move coincides with the country’s Ministry of Public Security decision to step up its scrutiny of IT enterprises, with an emphasis on policing multi-level business ventures, cryptocurrencies and online sports betting. The Vietnamese government has previously expressed a wish to create a comprehensive system of regulations for cryptocurrencies and fintech enterprises, and hopes to have this in place before the year’s end. Vietnam-based lawyer Duane Morris claimed on his blog this week that a draft bill may even be forthcoming in the next few days. He wrote, “Rumor has it that the first draft will be released shortly, possibly this weekend.” Enthusiasm about cryptocurrencies, mining and blockchain technology has been growing exponentially in Vietnam with population of 93 million, but encountered a major setback earlier this year when two large bogus initial coin offerings (ICOs) led to a huge public backlash. In the aftermath, the government vowed to regulate, with six ministries instructed to prepare countermeasures. _____

The Morgan Stanley Bitcoin derivatives will push the investment bank in the running with its competition currently dabbing in the cryptocurrency space. According to a person familiar with the venture, Morgan Stanley, one of the world’s largest investment banks, is trying to create ways for its client to get involved in the digital currency market. Institutional investors have shown that they don’t want to actually own any Bitcoin but more so want to trade for or against the price of it. The US bank will deal with contracts that give its investors synthetic exposure to the performance of cryptocurrency, the individual involved in the matter told Bloomberg. The bank is already prepared to offer Bitcoin and plans on launching when institutional client demand is proven. Morgan Stanley investors will be able to go long or short using their so-called price return Bitcoin swaps. The investment bank will charge a spread for each transaction, the person said. >> OKEx Founder Released from Custody and Denies Fraud Many of Wall Street’s biggest banks are pushing ahead their plans to offer the derivatives tied to Bitcoin, despite the crypto market’s downturn in January. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) are also preparing new products that are tied to Bitcoin. Last week, there were rumors floating around that Goldman Sachs had abandoned its plans to build a crypto trading desk. This put the entire crypto market in a total tailspin, but two days later the bank’s CFO called the news “fake.” Once banks see a demand for products such as Bitcoin derivatives, they are more than equipped to start offering them. The question then remains is, when will this happen? Will it take a monumental rise in the digital currency to spark institutional interest again? We will soon find out.

History of the crypto market capitalization: El-Erian is also not taking the usual Wall Street approach to crypto, either, eschewing the “blockchain, not bitcoin” mantra usually heard from traditional economists. He maintains his opinion that bitcoin is best bought at USD 5,000. This is a reiteration of his stance in June, when he told CNBC that bitcoin should be bought at under USD 5,000. Back then, he said he saw bitcoin emerging as more of a tradeable commodity than a currency, but “doesn't expect it will get all the way back to USD 20,000.” Adoption is coming, but not as quickly as we would like, and not in the same way. “In terms of crypto, what we’re getting is the realization that adoption is not going to be as big and as quick as the proponents of crypto would like,” he says. “I think it’s going to be there, it’s going to last for a long time, it’s going to play a role in the ecosystem, but it’s not going to be the currency that a lot of proponents would like it to be.” Not everyone agrees with his sentiment. Neil Wilson, chief analyst at online CFD (contract for difference) and forex broker Markets.com, was quoted by Bloomberg as saying that, “it just shows what a massive, speculative bubble the whole crypto thing was […]” referring to the crash of 2018. Still, people who have been invested in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies over a longer period of time dismiss negative comparisons to the dot-com era by pointing to the Nasdaq Composite’s recovery to fresh highs 15 years later, and to the internet’s enormous impact on society. They also note that Bitcoin has rebounded from past crashes of similar magnitude. Moreover, Vice President of the European Commission, former Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis, said recently that “crypto-assets are here to stay,” while encouraging cooperation between the European Commission and the European Financial Stability Board (EFSB) or the G20 on crypto regulation. In either case, only 13% of financial leaders at more than 2,000 companies in more than 20 of the largest US metropolitan areas think that cryptocurrency will not become common for business transactions in the next five years, a recent survey showed. 87% respondents chose answers ranging from ""Not very common"" to ""Very common"", according to the survey. Also, the blockchain technology is currently placed at the “trough of disillusionment” on the Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies by Gartner Inc., an American research and advisory company. Additionally, according to the company, blockchain will reach the plateau of productivity - the end stage of mass adoption - in five to ten years. Meanwhile, Meltem Demirors, a cryptocurrency investor, Chief Strategy Officer at CoinShares, told Cryptonews.com that “long term, the biggest adoption challenges remain psychological.” ""We need confident investors who have long term conviction and a market sufficiently robust and diversified to endure lapses of conviction or faith.

Buying drugs, weapons and other highly illegal paraphernalia is practically old news at this point. But now, a marketplace called SadaqaCoins surfaced: it allows you to “anonymously” fund Jihadi, an Islamist militant movement, snipers buy buying them a 4x4 pickup, optics, or rifle . If the movie Four Lions was shot today, this marketplace would have surely made it into the script. The opening line of the marketplace is, “Never will you attain the good (reward) until you spend (in the way of Allah) from that which you love. And whatever you spend — indeed, Allah is Knowing of it,” a verse from the Qur’an which urges believers to help those in need instead of hoarding their wealth. The name comes from giving: sadaqah literally means “righteousness” and refers to voluntary charity. It is not obligatory and does not have to be material: according to some hadiths (sayings from the prophet), “a kind word and smile” can be considered sadaqah and the best form of it is “passing on knowledge.” SadaqaCoins, spotted by Benjamin Strick, an open-source analyst with an interest in privacy, blockchain, maps, terrorist activity, and conflict areas, moves away from this explanation and into terrorist territory: it is not only a way to directly fund jihad activity, but also a platform for “various projects from the Mujahidin, Muhajirin and Ansar, along with their associated financial requirements”, according to their site. It is eerily similar to Kickstarter for mujahideen, offering the possibility of either donating (currently accepting Bitcoin, Ethereum and Monero) or listing your own project. The marketplace has gone a step further, and boasts an official Twitter account. Their pinned tweet reads: “The SadaqaCoins Team is pleased to present a gift and service for the Ummah [Muslim community]. The believers now have the opportunity to advertise and support the latest projects. A considerable advantage (over other platforms) is that it our service is anonymous and secure.” I believe the site is authentic due to a number of reasons such as content on the group's Telegram and Twitter page. But more significantly, SadaqaCoins uses an elaborate system of itemized bitcoin addresses for each project. These are different to its overall donation address. pic.twitter.com/wj4nHYXv9x At the time of writing, its Bitcoin address, however, remains empty. ""This dark web 'Kickstarter for Jihadis' offers translations in German and Turkish. This should be an alarm to authorities as to the origins of Jihadi financing via Bitcoin from Europe,"" Strick stressed. As policing and counter-terrorism agencies increase their skills in investigating cyber-crime and cryptocurrency tracing, more investigations are proving that donations and purchases can be traced using data from the blockchain. Still, according to the Financial Action Task Force, the majority of donations for terrorist organizations is made in cash - don’t let the crypto naysayers tell you otherwise. And please don’t fund terrorism, with crypto or otherwise - that’s not the adoption we strive for.",163.07000000000062,1

Bitcoin slowly moved lower and broke the USD 6,250 support. BTC/USD is now trading well below the USD 6,400 pivot level and it could continue to move down. Ethereum remained in a downtrend and it tumbled to a new yearly low near USD 165. Other major altcoins like ripple, bitcoin cash and litecoin are also heading south. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price failed to stay above the USD 6,250 support and traded below USD 6,200. Later, BTC/USD recovered a few points and it is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) down 1.6% to USD 6,220. If sellers remain in control, the price could continue to decline towards the USD 6,100 and USD 6,050 levels.
On the upside, the USD 6,300 level is an initial resistance, above which the USD 6,400 pivot level is the next crucial hurdle for bitcoin buyers. Ethereum
Ethereum price was one of the worst performers since it moved below the USD 185 support. ETH/USD traded to a new yearly low and close to USD 165. 
It seems like the price may perhaps continue to decline and sellers could attempt to push the price towards the next major support at USD 150. On the upsides, resistances are visible near the USD 180 and 185 levels. Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash fell significantly and registered losses more than 12% to USD 410. BCH/USD broke the USD 450 support area to move further into a bearish zone. If buyers fail to defend the USD 400 support, there could be heavy losses in the near term.
Ripple price is down around 5% and it seems like the price is about to test the USD 0.250 support. If XRP/USD fails to hold the USD 0.250 support, the next target could be USD 0.240. Other altcoins market today
Many small cap altcoins declined heavily during the past few hours like BTCD, NAS, PPT, GAS, NANO, WTC, DGD, REP, FUN, VET, LSK, ZRX and PIVX. Out of these bitcoin diamond declined 15.5% and NAS by 15.3%. Overall, the crypto market remains under a lot of pressure, which may result in more losses in bitcoin and ethereum. If BTC/USD slides below the USD 6,100 and USD 6,000 support levels, there could be a solid rise in selling in the short term.

BTC/USD seems to be struggling to clear the USD 6,400 resistance, increasing chances of a downside break in the near term. Similarly, ethereum remained below the USD 200 - USD 210 resistance zone with negative signs. Most major altcoins are trading in tight ranges with a tiny bearish angle. Going forward, the next move in bitcoin depends whether the price succeeds in clearing the USD 6,400 and USD 6,500 resistances. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price made another attempt to clear the USD 6,400 resistance. However, BTC/USD buyers failed to gain momentum, resulting in a rejection. On the downside, the USD 6,250 support remains a crucial barrier for sellers.
Should the price break the USD 6,250 support, there is a risk of an extended slide towards the USD 6,100 and USD 6,000 support levels. On the flip side, a close above USD 6,400 may possibly push the price above USD 6,500 in the short term. Ethereum
Ethereum price remained in a bearish zone below the USD 200 and USD 210 resistance levels. It seems like ETH/USD may continue to move down, and if it breaks USD 185, the next support is at USD 175.
On the upside, a break above the USD 210 pivot level is needed for a decent recovery towards USD 230 and USD 235 levels. Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash failed to break the USD 500 resistance and is currently down 2.5% to USD 270. If BCH/USD continues to move down, the price could test the USD 450 support zone. To recover, the price has to surpass the USD 490 and USD 500 resistance levels.
Ripple price is also down around 2.5% to USD 0.267. It seems like XRP/USD could continue to slide towards the USD 0.250 and USD 0.240 support levels in the near term. Other altcoins market today
Many small cap altcoins traded in a range during the past two sessions, including REP, MONA, LSK, BTCP, PIVX, ETC and NPXS. However, EMC and WAVES outperformed as they gained around 65% and 22% respectively. To sum up, bitcoin price is preparing for the next leg either above USD 6,400 or below USD 6,250. The current market sentiment is slightly bearish, but it won’t be easy for sellers to push the price below the USD 6,250 support in the short term. Similarly, ethereum may continue to find a strong buying interest near the USD 185 low.

The SEC is opposed to the use of ETFs as a means of investing in cryptocurrencies, and has attempted to ban them altogether from the United States market. A number of companies have been trying to find a way around the regulations, however, as many in the country would like to trade cryptocurrencies in the same way as conventional stocks and shares are bought and sold. One of the ways was Bitcoin-based ETN (exchange traded note) listed on Nasdaq Stockholm exchange, under the ticker CXBTF, as reported. However, now, per a statement on the SEC’s website, investors will now be frozen out of trading in XBT Provider AB’s Bitcoin Tracker One CXBTF.PQ CXBTF.PK and Ether Tracker One CETHF.PQ CETHF.PK until September 20 at the earliest. Although they are not listed on any United States stock exchange, XBT Provider AB’s products are both listed on a Nasdaq-registered exchange in Sweden, and over the counter (OTC) transactions are common in America. The SEC cited a “lack of current, consistent and accurate information” as its reason for action, and claimed “application materials submitted to enable the offer and sale of these financial products in the United States […] characterize [the products] as ETFs.” The SEC also alleges that “certain trading websites” are currently referring to the products as ETFs. ""During such trading suspension, however, a broker-dealer may engage in activities within the United States solely for the purpose of assisting non-broker-dealer customers with the liquidation of owned positions held as of the date of this order in a transaction (or series of transactions ending with a sale) effected on the Nasdaq Nordic or other trading platform located outside the United States or with non-US persons located outside the United States including the issuer,"" the SEC added.  ETNs are close cousins to ETFs (exchange traded funds), but there are some key differences. ETNs are structured products that are issued as senior debt notes, while ETFs represent a stake in an underlying commodity. ETNs are more like bonds in that they are unsecured.

This is mostly due to the rumor going around mainstream media about Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) putting a stop to its Bitcoin exchange desk—a rumor that the Goldman Sachs CFO put a stop to. The story originated from Business Insider. There are other speculations as to why the market dropped, but the overall consensus comes down to panic selling because the giant investment bank pulled its crypto plans. Goldman Sachs CFO, Marty Chavez, spoke out today at TechCrunch Disrupt and put an end to those rumors. “I was in New York yesterday, and I was co-chairing our risk committee, and I saw the news article,” Chavez told Tech Crunch. “It wasn’t like we announced anything or that anything had changed for us… I never thought I’d hear myself actually use this term, but I’d really have to describe that as fake news.” The CFO said that his bank is still considering how it will offer Bitcoin services to its clients. Goldman Sachs has been building a Bitcoin trading platform that is modeled on a commodities futures trading platform. This means that there is never any Bitcoin traded on the platform, but more the promise that the currency might move in the future. Chavez states that the next step for his bank is ‘non-deliverable forwards’ or derivatives. The exec explained that these would be over the counter derivatives. >> Robinhood Wants to Go Public—Trading Platform will Launch an IPO Chavez explained: “They’re settled in U.S. dollars and the reference price is the Bitcoin U.S. dollar price established by a set of exchanges, the same one that’s referenced in the futures contracts, and we’re working on that now because the clients wanted physical Bitcoin — something tremendously interesting and tremendously challenging. From the perspective of custody, we don’t yet see an institutional grade custody cases custodian solution for Bitcoin.” Yes, people. Even Business Insider gets things wrong too.

Talking at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference, he explained, “It wasn’t like we announced anything or that anything had changed for us… I never thought I’d hear myself actually use this term, but I’d really have to describe that as fake news.” Chavez further described that Goldman is working on Bitcoin futures and some other derivatives as their institutional clients are asking for it. As for physical bitcoin trading, he stressed that an institutional grade custodial solution for Bitcoin is first needed and they ""are interested in having that exist,"" but ""it's a long road."" A timeline, however, doesn’t exist. “It’s a long road and so I would just be speculating. Maybe someone who was thinking about our activities here got very excited that we would be making markets as principal and physical Bitcoin, and as they got into realizing that that’s part of the evolution but it’s not here yet,” Chavez explained. Meanwhile, the community is outraged that these ""fake news"" have helped to push the market lower. Reddit user u/SilverHoard writes, “People really need to be held accountable for spreading verified fake news. It's one thing to have a different opinion or make a mistake, but this is deliberate. And coincidentally just at the time someone takes out a massive and random short? It's fishy to say the least.” Others are angry at panic sellers: “The same people who scream about being in it for the tech and making a change in the world. The same people who cry we need to be decentralised and get away from big banks controlling us. These are the people who will sell at a LOSS the second some random news about an investment firm or bank is released.

Citing “people familiar with the matter,” the article said that Coinbase is currently in talks with blockchain technology experts at the giant Wall Street asset manager BlackRock about launching an ETF or other crypto related exchange traded product. BlackRock is the company behind iShares, one of the biggest issuers of ETFs in the US. According to one of the sources, BlackRock’s representatives have not yet given Coinbase any “concrete recommendations” on the matter. In the past, however, BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink has publicly stated that his firm’s clients do not want any crypto exposure, while even going as far as saying that he does not see any reason to prepare for the possibility of that happening in the future. With these previous comments from the BlackRock’s CEO in mind, it appears that BlackRock is not likely to be interested in becoming an issuer of a bitcoin ETF at this time. However, its team does possess valuable experience when it comes to launching ETFs, which Coinbase may be able to take advantage of, even by working with a different issuer to bring an ETF to market. The race to bring the first bitcoin-based ETF to market seems to be getting more intense by the day, with many previous attempts having already been rejected by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the regulatory body tasked with approving new ETFs in the US. It remains to be seen whether Coinbase will succeed with its ETF efforts in the foreseeable future. For now, however, all eyes are still on the much-discussed VanEck ETF that the SEC is expected to decide on by September 30.

Just @andread74 buying his second or third beer with bitcoin #lightningThis was a bit slower than the other transactions this evening, taking a whole six seconds before confirming. pic.twitter.com/ZKdcbiI4Db The post by the company further states the usefulness of the Lightning Network: “[it] introduces a range of benefits and potential use cases for Bitcoin, such as high-volume micro-transactions, high frequency and real-time trading without storing funds with third party exchanges, among others.”  However, the company reminds that Lightning Network is in its early days and more suited to advanced users and Bitcoin enthusiasts, ""but a huge community of developers is working behind the scenes on making it user-friendly and accessible to a wider audience"".  ""By implementing Lightning Network, CoinGate is dramatically reducing the technical barrier on the merchant’s side, essentially making it effortless, while users can enable or disable Lightning with a toggle of a switch,"" according to the company. The idea of the Lightning network is that transacting and settling would be done off-blockchain, so the fees are low and thanks to the implementation of smart contracts for security, the payments can be instant - no waiting time for block confirmation. Also, another important factor is its scalability, which is supposed to make it possible for millions to billions of transactions per second to take place across the network. After Lightning Network’s software lnd 0.4-beta version rolled out for the very first time in March, Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs, developer of the network, said that “Bitcoin enthusiasts have gotten excited about this, merchants are excited about this. It feels like we’re right on the edge of mass cryptocurrency adoption.” More good news Meanwhile, more positive news for crypto come from the cannabis publication High Times: it seems that they are accepting crypto for their current initial public offering (IPO) after all. Their representative Jon Cappetta told CoinDesk that the filing, stating that they would not be accepting bitcoin and ether, was made “to make the SEC [the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] happy.” “We're accepting [cryptocurrencies] as a payment option, but technically Fund America takes the bitcoin and ethereum,” Cappetta was quoted as saying. High Times, which has been a mouthpiece for the pro-cannabis community since 1974, had previously claimed that “with a magazine and online presence still going strong, many are eager to grab some shares.”",-225.97000000000025,0

At the time of writing, out of the top 100 coins by market capitalization, even stablecoins have taken a nosedive. The community is struggling to explain this uncharacteristic phenomenon. A few main theories took hold of the community: the first is that the drop happened because of the news that Goldman Sachs is ditching plans for crypto. The second is that Bitcoin was being dumped on several cryptocurrency exchanges, most notably BitMEX.  Roughly half of this last $BTC dump's volume on @bitfinex was margin short sells after the iceberg at $6.9k was pulled: pic.twitter.com/dO5O8KSXTZ The third - and most prevailing one - is that this is simple market manipulation. Also, others are discussing whether it might be a bull trap, or a false signal indicating that a declining trend in a price of an asset has reversed and is heading upwards when, in fact, the price will continue to decline.  The manipulation theory brought out some interesting ideas: Twitter user @bechokoy_betts argues that “this is why decentralized markets don’t work in a sense.” Others argue that the volatility has nothing to do with decentralization, but that this volatility will drive out any possibility of a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF) approval soon. “How can we ever grow as a community or prove to the SEC [The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] or anyone the crypto market is safe? Think what you want, today’s drop is clearly market manipulation,” writes Reddit user u/cryptocrew72. However, the Reddit community is not so easily persuaded: user u/mrcartel708 simply says, “If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen,” to the approval of many others.  Still, everyone is a little uneasy in the face of the upcoming bitcoin ETF decision. This is where the theory about the Goldman Sachs decision comes into play: many believe that the market’s steep fall is in response to that, and that Wall Street is giving up on crypto. CNBC Television talked to experts about what Bitcoin’s next catalyst and whether the ETF still has a chance of happening. The biggest problem for Goldman, they say, is the fact that it would be hard for them to get institutional investors on board with crypto integration. Meanwhile, Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp., told Bloomberg that a lot of retail investors’ hopes for a bigger institutional presence were really being driven by Goldman Sachs: “This is just a negative, negative sign as far as liquidity goes.” According to him, the next key level to watch for Bitcoin is USD 5,000, while a drop below that threshold may cause losses to accelerate. “It will either rain tomorrow ... or it will not rain”  The second theory about crypto, especially Bitcoin, being dumped is the one that ties into both of the previous ones: no matter which reason initially brought the prices down, the dump likely followed as a result of panic selling, the community believes. However, those in favor of the manipulation theory believe that even the news of Goldman surfaced just in time to hide a dump by a whale, instead leaving the community to blame the market drop on Wall Street. Whatever the reason for the red market, people would like to know where the decline ends and whether brighter days can be expected. One of the most popular ways in traditional trading is through technical analysis (TA). However, famous crypto trader Ronnie Moas took to Twitter to poke fun at TAs, saying that, “on that chart BTC may even be overbought and poised for a reversal ... or maybe it is going higher ... or it will flat-line.” He explains that this is the same as saying, “It will either rain tomorrow ... or it will not rain.”  TA is like handing over your Autonomous car control based on the car's rear cameras. Other than just poking fun at the mental image of analysts scrambling around and trying to make sense of charts and graphs, the community is coming together through their sense of humor as well. “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything,” has become the new unofficial motto of the current drop - an appropriation of the recent controversial Nike ad that featured Colin Kaepernick, an American football player, and sparked a heated debate in the US. Another example is this gif, which pretty much sums up the state of the market right now.  Meanwhile, Tuur Demeester, a popular economist and bitcoin-investor, took a chance on Twitter to remind his previous forecast that new highs for bitcoin are unlikely this year.  In the same thread, he also expressed his negative opinion towards ether: Since I wrote this 2yrs ago, ETH retraced almost all of its gains vs. BTC. Ethereum today is bloated, centralized, with hardly credible scaling plans, while Bitcoin is more lean and robust than ever, growing in many directions via 2nd layer scaling and institutional adoption. pic.twitter.com/YNX4W3l7uf On a brighter note: the internet’s favorite joke crypto, Dogecoin, has overtaken OmiseGO and is currently the 21st coin by market cap. DOGE has lost relatively little: “only” 4.45%.

Bitcoin failed to surpass the stated resistance and tumbled more than USD 1,000 during the past three sessions. BTC/USD is down roughly 15% and broke key supports like USD 7,100, USD 6,800, USD 6,500 and USD 6,400. Similarly, there were heavy declines noted in major altcoins like ethereum, bitcoin cash, ripple, litecoin, eos, neo and ICON. It seems like the market sentiment turned bearish and the last fifteen days gains were trimmed in a single day. Meanwhile, a few main theories took hold of the community, who's trying to understand what's going on in the market - read about them here. Total market capitalization Bitcoin
The USD 7,400 resistance proved worth as bitcoin price reacted to the downside and declined heavily. BTC/USD sellers took control and pushed the price towards the USD 6,250 support. The price is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) consolidating gains above USD 6,250, but it remains at a risk of more losses.
On the downside, a break below the USD 6,250 support could push the price back towards the USD 6,000 handle. On the flip side, if the price corrects higher, it could face a strong resistance near the USD 6,500 and USD 6,600 levels. Ethereum
Ethereum price broke the last major support at USD 250 and traded to a new multi month low near USD 210. ETH/USD is under a lot of bearish pressure and it seems like sellers could push the price towards the USD 200 handle.
On the upside, buyers are likely to face a lot of selling interest close to the USD 240 and USD 250 levels in the near term.  Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash price trimmed most of its last week’s gain and declined more than USD 100. BCH/USD is down around 22% and it broke the USD 550 and USD 520 support levels. It is now trading near the USD 500 level with an immediate support at USD 480. On the upside, resistances are at USD 520 and 530.
Ripple price broke the USD 0.300 and 0.280 supports before buyers appeared near USD 0.265. XRP/USD is currently correcting higher towards the USD 0.288 and USD 0.295 resistance levels. Other altcoins market today
During the recent decline, many small cap altcoins tumbled between 20%-30%, including IOST, BCN, STRAT, BTCD, NPXS, NAS, WTC, BAT, ELF, GAS, NANO, GNT, DGB and DASH. Clearly, bitcoin and altcoins suffered heavy losses during the past few hours. The market sentiment changed to bearish and if BTC/USD fails to stay above the USD 6,250 and USD 6,000 support levels, there could be more declines in the coming days. More importantly, a close below USD 200 in ETH/USD may well put a lot of pressure on other altcoins.  _____

This does not mean the giant is moving out of the cryptocurrency space for good: they are still working on a custody product for cryptocurrency holders, as Bloomberg reported last month.

BTC/USD tested the next important resistance at USD 7,400 and it is currently consolidating gains. To the topside, the USD 7,400 and USD 7,500 levels are crucial hurdles for buyers. Therefore, the next move depends whether buyers are able to push the price above these levels. On the other hand, there was a minor downward move in major altcoins like ethereum, bitcoin cash and ripple, but they all are still trading above key supports. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price gained more than 1% recently and tested the USD 7,400 resistance. BTC/USD is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) trading with bullish moves above the previous resistance (now support) at USD 7,350. However, buyers need to push the price above the USD 7,400 barrier and then USD 7,500. Both are important resistances for a move towards the USD 8,000 handle.
If buyers fail, there could be a downside correction towards the USD 7,250 and USD 7,050 support levels in the near term. Ethereum
Ethereum price could not settle above the USD 290 resistance and it slowly declined. ETH/USD is down around 1%, but it is still trading above the USD 275 support, which is a positive sign.
Buyers need to gain momentum above the USD 290 resistance for more upsides towards USD 300 and USD 310 in the short term.  Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash price remained confined in a tiny range above the USD 620 support. BCH/USD needs to break the USD 640 and USD 650 resistances to start a fresh upward move. On the other hand, a break below the USD 620 range support could ignite bearish moves in the near term towards USD 600 and USD 580.
Ripple price seems to be struggling to gain buying interest and it is currently down more than 1.2% to USD 0.328. XRP/USD could continue to move down towards the next supports at USD 0.325 and USD 0.323. Other altcoins market today
The market sentiment was mostly positive for small cap altcoins like dropil, STRAT and bytecoin, PIVX, MOAC, NPXS, GAS, MCO and PAY. Out of these dropil climbed around 17% and STRAT gained roughly 12%. To sum up, bitcoin price remains in an uptrend above the USD 7,250 support. However, buyers are likely to face a lot of selling interest near the USD 7,400 and USD 7,500 resistance levels. Should there be a close above USD 7,500, there could be solid gains in BTC and altcoins in the coming days.

However, these bulls have been left disappointed recently as the SEC has handed out a handful of rejections and postponements. Bill Barhydt, CEO of Bitcoin payment start-up Abra, told CNBC that it’s because the applications sent in haven’t fit the financial archetype that the SEC is looking for. “I think the issue with the SEC, quite frankly, is that the people who are doing the applications don’t fit the mold of who the SEC is used to approving,” Barhydt told CNBC today. The CEO states that he used to work for Goldman Sachs and made a point to address his clothing attire in comparison to how these ETF applications are being sent in. Many of the new tech start-ups and blockchain company executives have a much laxer work attire compared to those working on Wall Street. Barhydt states that he couldn’t just go into the SEC wearing what he’s wearing and expect them to accept an application for distributing ETFs. It has nothing to do with clothing, per say, but has everything to do with the reputation and foundation of the company applying to distribute bitcoin ETFs. So far this year, the financial watchdog has rejected multiple bitcoin ETF proposals. Bitcoin (BTC) futures were introduced back in mid-December, and many believe ETFs are the next vital step for transforming the crypto space into a mainstream industry. Abra’s CEO told CNBC that for an application to be approved by the SEC, it would take an applicant who “looks, feels, and smells” the way the SEC wants them to. >> Kingdom Trust Secures Crypto Insurance from Llyod’s of London “It’s going to happen in the next year, I would actually make a bet on it,” Barhydt said. “There is too much demand for it.” It seems the Abra exec is pretty confident in Bitcoin ETFs coming to the markets soon.

These predictions were reached by starting at the assumption that the more tokens are in circulation, the less their value. The research also estimates a constant increase in price, but claims “conservative” estimates in general. In short, it relies on a price prediction based on underlying value rather than speculation. “Cryptoassets which apply unique value propositions within deep and viral markets” should spike, and these include Bitcoin, Monero and Decred among others, while Bcash will drop as it is a “cryptoasset which attempts to inherit brand recognition and provide minimal technological advantage to incumbents.” The prices that should see the biggest drop, according to the document, are Stellar, Ripple and Cardano; Monero is estimated to reach close to USD 40,000 within the decade, and Ethereum should see about a double increase in price, but neither a spike nor a drop like the others. The crypto community sarcastically calls this a “Monero shill” and generally consider it “a**talkery.” On Twitter, user @Mr_Rupee says, “The good part of making 10 year prediction is no one will remember to question you after 10 years....” Of course, there are always those shilling their own coins that they claim will replace existing ones. Some people simply call Satis Group “scammers.” Twitter user @0xPineapple writes, “No one has ever successfully applied quantity theory of money to cryptoassets and shown meaningful real world correlation. I suppose it could be an instructive thought exercise in the absence of proven frameworks. Are these guys pivoting away from ICO services?”, while @njderuiter says, “@SatisGroup is the same group that claimed 80% of ICOs were scams. Nobody bothered to check their flawed research, where factors they chose to define whether something would be labelled as such were either extremely vague, or simply ridiculous. But hey, it fits the narrative!” Still, Satis Group is hardly the only one with bullish predictions. Tim Draper, famous early investor in groundbreaking projects such as the internet, Tesla, Skype and Hotmail among others is famed for his prediction that BTC will reach USD 250,000 within four years. John McAfee, a self proclaimed “crypto visionary” and software tycoon, predicted that Bitcoin would reach USD 1 million by the end of 2020, or he will eat his… private parts.

Therefore, dips from the current levels towards the USD 6,800 support are likely to find a strong buying interest. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the USD 7,050 level. Above this, the price could make another attempt to surpass the USD 7,130 - USD 7,150 resistance. Ethereum
Ethereum price struggled a lot during the past two sessions and is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) down around 3%. ETH/USD is slowly declining toward the USD 280 support, which is a crucial zone for both sellers and buyers.
If the price fails to hold the USD 280 support, it might extend losses towards the USD 275 and USD 270 levels. On the upside, resistances are aligned near USD 288, USD 290 and USD 298.  Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash price remained stable above the USD 540 support and is currently trading in a range. BCH/USD must break the USD 570 resistance for a fresh upward move towards USD 600. On the other hand, a close below USD 540 may perhaps push the price back in a bearish zone.
Ripple price trimmed most of its gains and is currently down more than 3.5% to USD 0.331. The immediate support is USD 0.330, below which the price is likely to test the USD 0.320 support. Other altcoins market today
Most small cap altcoins corrected lower during the past two sessions, including nano, IOTA, ONT, LINK, IOST, NPXS, BCN, WAN and ELF. However, two altcoins, NOAH and DOGE gained traction recently and climbed around 41% and 20% respectively. Overall, it seems like bitcoin has started a short-term correction, but as long as BTC/USD is above the USD 6,800 support, it might to bounce back. Ethereum, on the other hand remains at a risk of a downside break below the USD 280 support. _____

As previously reported on Cryptonews.com, mining has become significantly less profitable in the past few months due to a range of factors, but this seems to have done very little to dampen the enthusiasm many Russians currently feel for cryptocurrencies and mining. The number of new companies created to mine tokens in Russia has risen by 15% since the start of this year, despite an estimated 90% drop in profitability. Earlier this week, the governor of the Leningrad Oblast (the area surrounding St Petersburg) claimed the province had opened a 4,000sqm mining facility kitted out with 3,000 units of mining equipment. The governor stated that the facility’s energy capacity was 20mW, and had cost over USD 7 million to construct. The development’s owners have claimed the mine is the country’s largest, and was built on the grounds of a former Soviet-era fertilizer factory that had stood vacant for 20 years. Meanwhile, CryptoUniverse, a Russian mining specialist that trades directly with Chinese mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain, has opened a sales office in Novosibirsk, Siberia. Per news outlet Novosibirsk Online, the company already has offices in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Irkutsk, and says it will now allow Novosibirsk-based customers to buy their mining hardware directly. Siberian electricity prices are among the lowest in the world. The federal district has recently seen a mine whose capacity could reach up to 120 megawatts thermal (mWt) open in Divnogorsk, whereas its infrastructure costs were expected to be around 3 billion rubles (USD 44 million).  However, in Ufa, the capital of the Russian federal subject Republic of Bashkortostan, police have arrested a 33-year-old man, accusing him of conning 14 Ufa residents aged 45 to 62 out of over a total of some USD 265,000. Per media outlet Pravda, the suspect claimed he was going to build a refuse processing plant and “fuel-free” electric generators – which could be used to power cryptocurrency mining hardware.",-65.53000000000065,0

Similarly, there were decent gains in major altcoins like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, EOS, IOTA and litecoin. The current market sentiment is stable, but prices may correct lower in the short term before a fresh upward move. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price accelerated higher and surged towards the USD 7,150 level. BTC/USD closed above the USD 7,000 level, which is a positive sign and indicating a bullish trend. If there is a downside correction, the broken resistances at USD 7,000 and USD 6,900 are likely to act as supports. 
On the upside, an initial resistance is USD 7,100, above which the price is likely to trade towards USD 7,200 and USD 7,220 during the coming sessions. On the other hand, a push below the USD 6,900 support could send the price towards the USD 6,750 support. Ethereum
Ethereum price moved slowly above the USD 290 resistance. However, gains in ETH/USD were limited and the pair even failed to test the USD 300 resistance.

Bitcoin cash price tested the USD 570 resistance before retreating back to USD 550. BCH/USD is currently holding the USD 550 support and it is likely to trade higher towards USD 560 and USD 570. On the downside, the most important support is USD 540 (the previous key resistance).
Ripple price traded above the USD 0.350 resistance and almost tested USD 0.360. XRP/USD is currently trading flat near the USD 0.343 level with key supports on the downside at USD 0.335 and USD 0.330. Other altcoins market today

Bitcoin price gained bullish momentum after it broke the USD 6,600 resistance and surged above the USD 6,800 resistance. BTC/USD traded close to the USD 6,950 level and is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) trading in a tiny range above USD 6,850.
The current price action is super bullish and it seems like the price may perhaps continue to move higher above the recent high and USD 6,950. The next major resistance is at USD 7,000, above which the price is likely to accelerate towards the USD 7,200 level. Supports on the downside are at USD 6,800 and USD 6,750. Ethereum
Ethereum price also followed bitcoin price and traded up around 4%. ETH/USD broke the USD 280 and USD 285 resistances to move into a short-term positive zone.
On the upside, the next key resistance for buyers is near the USD 300 level. If buyers succeed in clearing USD 300, the price is likely to accelerate towards USD 325 and USD 335.  Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash price was able to move above an important resistance at USD 540. BCH/USD is currently up around 3.6% and it is facing a strong sell zone near the USD 550 level. An hourly close above USD 550 may possibly push the price above the USD 570 level. Supports on the downside are at USD 520 and USD 500.
Ripple price performed well and climbed above the USD 0.342 level. The next resistance for XRP/USD is USD 0.350, above which the pair may break the USD 0.365 resistance. Other altcoins market today

Lee,  who serves as the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said that the performance of emerging market stocks has correlated closely with the price of bitcoin since the beginning of 2017. Comparing the two markets, Lee, speaking on CNBC, said that “both really essentially peaked early this year, and they both have been in a downward trend.” “When emerging markets do well, it’s because we’re in a ‘risk-on’ environment, and when it does poorly it’s because we’re in a ‘risk-off’ environment,” Lee explained, adding that he doesn’t believe bitcoin will rise until traders with a ‘risk-on’ mentality are back. Comparing the two charts below, a correlation can definitely be spotted, with bitcoin (bottom chart) peaking about a month before the MSCI Emerging Markets Index (top chart).  However, it could be argued that emerging market stocks have declined because their currencies have been in decline, such as the situation is with the Turkish lira. And as we have seen in both Turkey, and to an even greater extent in Venezuela, weaker national currencies tend to increase demand for bitcoin. While Lee agrees with this, he explained that the majority of bitcoin trading is not taking place in emerging markets, but rather in countries like South Korea, Japan, China, the US, and Europe. However, Lee now sees the markets finally turning to a point where both emerging market equities and bitcoin will be valued higher. Especially if the US dollar weakens going forward, Lee sees “big money and firepower on the sidelines” waiting to move into the crypto space, confirming his bitcoin price target for the end of the year. Meanwhile, Changpeng Zhao, founder and CEO of Binance, a major exchange, has also reminded the explosive bitcoin price jump in the H2 of 2017. In either case, it doesn’t mean that it will repeat this year, too.  2017 Sept: BTC price $3000, FUD / negative news abound.  3 months later: BTC price $20,000. _____ Watch Tom Lee discussing the Bitcoin market: Fundstrat's Tom Lee may have found the next leading indicator for bitcoin from CNBC.",173.84000000000015,1

Speaking about the bitcoin futures contracts that the proposed ETFs intend to hold, Chris Matta, co-founder of Crescent Crypto Asset Management told Bloomberg that “the markets are small and the volumes on some of these exchanges are low, which makes it such that manipulation is possible.” “[…] That’s their major concern, and without having any sort of regulatory body stepping in and policing people doing that, it’s always a possibility. A bitcoin ETF will not start trading this year,” the crypto fund manager said. The only proposed ETF backed by “physical” bitcoins, the VanEck bitcoin ETF, is therefore widely considered to have a better chance at getting approved, given the fact that the market for “physical” bitcoins is much deeper and more liquid than the futures market. However, the decision on that ETF may be pushed as far back as February next year. As reported by Cryptonews.com, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will take a second look at its decision from last week to reject bitcoin ETF proposals from three US-based providers. The decision to review the rejections, that were made by SEC staff members, and not by the four commissioners at the SEC, appears to have been pushed by commissioner Hester Peirce, who tweeted that the decision is “stayed pending Commission review.” Hester Peirce, who was the only commissioner to vote in favor of the proposed Winklevoss bitcoin ETF, has over the recent months argued extensively for the approval of a bitcoin-based ETF. In a lengthy piece that explained her thinking, Peirce wrote that “I reject the role of gatekeeper of innovation.”",173.84000000000015,1

Users who lost their login credentials will have to use the offline method. This includes sending proofs to an address in Tokyo designated by the Mt Gox trustee.

In an official letter from the SEC, the secretary of the Commission wrote that the “[…] order is stayed until the Commission orders otherwise,” without specifying any timeline for the review.

The rejections come just one day ahead of the deadline stipulated for a pair of Bitcoin ETFs submitted by ProShares. Proshares was working with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ETF exchange NYSE Arca. The SEC said the proposals did not do enough to show they were “designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.” All applications denied were directly linked to Bitcoin futures contracts. The SEC said that none of the nine applications had enough information to show that the futures markets are of “significant size.” >> SEC ETF Delay “That failure is critical because, as explained below, the Exchange has failed to establish that other means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices will be sufficient, and therefore surveillance-sharing with a regulated market of significant size related to bitcoin is necessary,” the SEC wrote. In short, if the Bitcoin futures market is too small, the SEC fears it could be easily manipulated. Last December, the commodities trading venues CBOE and CME launched the first Bitcoin futures, but the daily trade volume still remains small. This isn’t the first SEC Bitcoin ETF rejection though. In July, the US Olympian Winklevoss Twins, who own the crypto exchange Gemini, were denied their Bitcoin ETF proposal as well. Unsurprisingly, the crypto market has dropped since the SEC ruling.

Important to point out is that all of the funds rejected were intended to be backed by bitcoin futures contracts, without holding any physical bitcoins. Considering the SECs past objections to these types of funds, it was already largely expected that these proposals would be rejected.

Despite they recognize that their ""analysis is far from perfect"", the researchers estimate that Satoshi had mined up to 700,000 bitcoins in 2009, or less than previously estimated a million of coins. The BitMEX research blog specializes in analysis of the crypto space. This time, their attempt at finding out how much a single dominant miner could have generated back in the beginnings of the cryptocurrency was inspired by blockchain researcher Sergio Demian Lerner. In 2013, he claimed that Satoshi had mined a million bitcoins in 2009. “Our analysis is far from perfect and we used a variety of methods [...] We will have made many errors and we do not claim our methodology is robust or scientific. However, as far as we are aware, this is the first attempt to allocate every block in 2009 as belonging to the apparent single entity or not,” the blog states. What they found was that up to August 2009, there is a pattern indicating a single dominant miner, but after this period, the pattern breaks down. However, this pattern could also indicate several miners with similar setups: “Each miner is not independent, in the sense that they are likely to be running the same software or could be using the same popular hardware, which could produce the same pattern.” There is still strong evidence of a dominant miner in 2009. However, the blog goes on to say that the evidence is “far less robust than many have assumed.” Also, it is quite possible that the dominant miner was not Satoshi at all, “although we know Satoshi mined block 9, which we have allocated to the dominant miner in our analysis.” In short, even if Satoshi was the dominant miner from 2009 - he probably didn’t go for a whole million, as “600,000 to 700,000 bitcoin is a better estimate,” according to BitMEX. However, even if the number is more or less accurate, it would be even harder to find out how many coins Satoshi owns now.  ""Whoever the dominant miner was, it is of course possible the keys have been lost or discarded by now,"" the researchers added.

The price later pulled back slightly, but has still maintained the majority of the gains from the sudden spike. Today’s short squeeze was by many already expected to occur due to the unusually high number of bitcoin short positions in the market. On the Bitfinex exchange, the ratio of bitcoin short to bitcoin long positions reached 1.4 on August 15, the highest level since November last year. Since then, the short-to-long ratio has continued to climb, reaching a high of 1.5 on Tuesday. Today’s spike in bitcoin prices, however, was accompanied by a sharp fall in short positions, indicating that the move was at least partially driven by traders exiting their short positions. When traders exit their short positions, often referred to as short covering, they have to buy back bitcoins in the open market, which can sometimes cause large price increases. And with the short-to-long ratio still at very high levels not seen since last year, the action may not be over quite yet. According to a Bloomberg interview on Wednesday, Timothy Tam, CEO at cryptocurrency data analysis firm CoinFi, “when there’s a record number of shorts, if there’s a large explosive price movement up like this, it means people will need to cover their shorts quite quickly,” adding that “it’s almost like a domino effect.”",-109.53999999999996,0

First of all, it’s important to realize that not all ETFs are the same. Out of the 10 ETFs currently being reviewed by the SEC, only one will actually hold physical bitcoins in its reserves. That one is the much-talked about VanEck bitcoin ETF that was filed through the CBOE exchange earlier this year. The other nine ETF proposals on the SECs table are not backed by bitcoin, but instead backed by futures contracts of bitcoin. In the US, bitcoin futures contracts are traded at two major futures exchanges in Chicago known as CBOE and CME.  What Is a Bitcoin Futures Contract? Futures contracts were originally designed for farmers and other commodity producers to lock in prices of the commodities they wished to trade at a future date. When that date came, the holder and the issuer of the contract would settle it by having the commodity physically delivered to the person holding the contract. Bitcoin futures, however, are structured in a way that has no link to the actual market for bitcoin. Instead of having bitcoins delivered to the person holding the contract when it expires, the contract is settled in cash, without any bitcoins ever changing hands. Despite this, some experts have claimed that bitcoin futures have caused greater volatility in the bitcoin market, in particular on the days the contracts expire. Do Futures-Based ETFs Matter? Although a futures-based ETF wouldn’t hold any bitcoins, it can still be argued that it is good for the bitcoin market because it spreads knowledge about bitcoin to new types of investors who may choose to buy physical bitcoins at some point in the future. It would also legitimize the asset even more in the eyes of traditional Wall Street investors and financial institutions, and most likely lead to the creation of more bitcoin-based investment products in the future. That said, most experts agree that an ETF backed by physical bitcoins would by far be the most impactful event for the price of bitcoin both in the short and long run. Community Is Divided Some members of the bitcoin community, including technologist and serial entrepreneur Andreas Antonopoulos, are against Wall Street money pouring into bitcoin in the form of an ETF. “I think it's a terrible idea. <...> ETFs fundamentally violate the underlying principle of peer-to-peer money, where each user is operating not through custodian, but has a direct control of their money, because they have direct control of their keys. Your keys - your bitcoin, not your keys - not your bitcoin,” Antonopoulous warned adding that Bitcoin ETF will become an instrument to manipulate bitcoin prices, scaling and forking debates.  Nick Szabo, a famous computer scientist, legal scholar and cryptographer, also shares the same viewpoint, arguing that it “might cause more problems than it’s worth.” I for one am not lobbying for an ETF or for Wall Street-managed money in general. It might cause more problems than it's worth. The recent sell-off by dumb money has or soon will deprecate many opinionated know-nothings in this space. We don't need new ones to take their place. https://t.co/s7OxZt9IrJ Others, however, argue that a regulated investment product such as an ETF is the only way for bitcoin to truly catch on as a mainstream asset class globally, saying that “people do not want self-custody.” Because most people do Not want to self custody. The only people in crypto now are power users, developers and traders. If you wan this to be a global thing, then they will want something that is easy and regulated. That’s facts. The next deadline for the SEC to decide on a bitcoin ETF is Thursday August 23, when it is set to decide the fate of a proposal from ProShares, a well-established provider of ETFs in the US. ProShares’ proposal includes two ETFs, one that would let investors bet on the bitcoin price going up, and another that would offer short exposure, meaning investors can profit when the bitcoin price goes down. Physical Futures Coming With the link between the bitcoin futures market and the physical market being weak at best, a new start-up dubbed Bakkt is trying to change this by introducing 1-day physically delivered bitcoin futures contracts in November this year. With our solution the buying and selling of bitcoin is fully collateralized or pre-funded. Our new daily bitcoin contract will not be traded on margin, use leverage or serve to create a paper claim on a real asset. The new company, set up by heavyweight financial institution Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) has already received investments from crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital, and is working with major brands like Microsoft, BCG, and Starbucks on developing the platform, which Wall Street veteran Mike Novogratz referred to as “the most important news in crypto this year.”",-109.53999999999996,0

BTC/USD declined and broke the USD 6,400 support to test the next support at USD 6,250 where buyers appeared. More importantly, there was a solid rise in selling pressure on ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash. ETH/USD broke the USD 295 and USD 285 support levels to move into a bearish zone. The current price action indicates that bitcoin and altcoins failed to gain momentum above key resistances (as discussed in yesterday’s market outlook), resulting in a bearish reaction. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price came under renewed selling pressure and declined below the USD 6,400 support. BTC/USD tested a crucial support near the USD 6,250 level, which acted as a solid buy zone. The price is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) correcting higher, but the broken supports at USD 6,400 and USD 6,500 are likely to act as resistances.
If buyers fail to push the price above the USD 6,500 resistance, it could decline once again. On the downside, the USD 6,250 support holds a lot of importance, below which, the price may perhaps test the USD 6,000 level. Ethereum
Ethereum declined sharply after sellers managed to push the price below the USD 300 support. ETH/USD dropped below the USD 290 and USD 285 support levels to move into a bearish zone.
The price tested the USD 270 level and it is currently rebounding. However, the previous supports at USD 285 and USD 290 are likely to act as major barriers for buyers. Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash price managed to stay above the USD 520 support. However, BCH/USD seems to be facing many hurdles on the upside near the USD 560 and USD 580 levels. On the flip side, a break below the USD 520 support could ignite bearish moves towards USD 500 and USD 480.
Ripple price tested the USD 0.320 support area and is currently recovering towards USD 0.340. Above this, XRP/USD may possibly test the USD 0.350 resistance in the near term. Other Altcoins Market Today
The market sentiment turned short-term bearish, pressuring many small cap altcoins like tezos, VERI, AOA, KCS, BTCP, kin, populous, XZC, funfair, cortex, RDD and RHOC (all declined between 8%-16%). Overall, bitcoin has to move above the USD 6,400 and USD 6,500 resistance levels to overcome selling pressure. If not, there is a risk of a downside break below USD 6,250 and USD 6,000 in the near term. _____

As part of his bitcoin exchange business, the young man, identified as Jacob Burrel Campos, accepted cash payments in person, through his bank account, and through MoneyGram, while failing to comply with anti-money laundering requirements. According to the document from the US Attorney’s Office, he had a “no questions asked” policy towards his customers, and charged a 5% exchange fee for his services. He is also accused of sending over USD 900,000 from his bank account to “a bank account in Taiwan in the name of Bitfinex,” and then using those funds to buy bitcoins in order to operate his business. For this, the young California man is charged with 28 counts of international money laundering, carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Jacob Burrel Campos was arrested on August 13 this year as he was entering the US from Mexico. Noting that Burrel has “citizenship in three countries, no steady employment in the United States, and the ability to access large sums of cash,” authorities concluded that there was a significant risk of him fleeing and that he should be held without bail. In another case earlier this year, a Texas man admitted that he had used customer deposits on a bitcoin platform he operated for his own personal expenses, and that he had lied to customers about a hack on his platform back in 2013.

BTC/USD is trading with positive signs above USD 6,400 and it seems like the price could accelerate above the USD 6,500 resistance in the near term. Similarly, ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin and neo traded higher with bullish moves. The current market sentiment is signaling more upsides as long as bitcoin price is trading above the USD 6,250 support. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price remained in an uptrend from the USD 6,000 swing low and it recently settled above USD 6,250. BTC/USD is currently up around 1% with the immediate resistance at USD 6,500 (UTC 08:20 AM). Above this, the price is likely to climb towards the USD 6,700 and USD 6,800 resistance levels.
On the other hand, if there is a downside correction, the USD 6,250 support zone could act as a strong barrier for sellers. Below this, the price will most likely retest the USD 6,000 support area. Ethereum
Ethereum is currently up more than 3% and is trading near the USD 300 - USD 305 resistance zone. If ETH/USD settles above the stated resistance zone, it could continue to rise towards the USD 330 level.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 290 followed by USD 284. Below this last, the price may perhaps test the USD 260 support level. Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash is slowly rising towards the USD 540 resistance. If BCH/USD clears the USD 540 resistance, it might accelerate above USD 550 to test the USD 565 resistance. On the downside, there are decent supports near the USD 520 and USD 505 levels.
Ripple price surging above the USD 0.300 resistance and it is currently up more than 7%. The next resistance for XRP/USD buyers is near the USD 0.325 level, above which, the price could test USD 0.340. Other altcoins market today
Many small cap altcoins rallied today by more than 20%, including cortex, VET, NPXS, nano, ONT, WTC, PPT, kin, verge, bitcoin private and AION. Out of these, cortex and VET were the best performers with 54% and 46% gains respectively. Overall, bitcoin is trading with many positive signs above USD 6,250. A successful close above USD 6,500 will most likely trigger more upsides in BTC/USD and altcoins in the coming sessions.

A Bitcoin-based ETN (exchange traded note) listed on Nasdaq Stockholm exchange is being quoted in dollars since Wednesday, under the ticker CXBTF. ETNs are close cousins to ETFs (exchange traded funds), but there are some key differences. ETNs are structured products that are issued as senior debt notes, while ETFs represent a stake in an underlying commodity. ETNs are more like bonds in that they are unsecured. ETFs provide investments into a fund that holds the assets it tracks, like stocks, bonds or gold. The Bitcoin ETN has been trading on the Swedish stock exchange since 2015, but was only offered in euros and kronas, Sweden’s native currency. As it is now quoted in dollars, this is an attempt to market it towards US investors - if investors can convince their brokerage account providers to make the Bitcoin ETN available on their platforms. “Everyone that’s investing in dollars can now get exposure to these products, whereas before, they were only available in euros or Swedish krona. Given the current climate on the regulatory front in the U.S., this is a big win for Bitcoin,” CEO of CoinShares Holdings, Ryan Radloff, told Bloomberg. The product is dubbed Bitcoin Tracker One, and according to Bloomberg, trading it is “similar to buying an American depositary receipt, in that traders will see a foreign-listed asset in US dollars.” Although trades will be done in dollars, everything else will take place in the Swedish market. Although it is speculated that a Bitcoin ETF would most likely send the price of the cryptocurrency upwards, the ETN announcement is not expected to have the same effect.  Also, as reported, the largest ETN trader in Europe, Amsterdam-based Flow Traders NV, is now making the first move into this market as it aims to profit from high-frequency trading of ETNs based on bitcoin and ethereum.",239.72000000000025,1

In an email to their clients, the company writes that the decline in bitcoin prices that started in January have coincided with “heavily rising difficulty” of bitcoin mining in April in May. “As a result,” the company writes, “some user contracts are now mining less than the daily maintenance fee requires to be covered, and thus they entered the 60 days grace period, after which open-ended contracts will get terminated.” Also, the company has offered a USD 105 discount to existing customers after upgrading to its premium service, known as Radiant. Cloud mining is the process of hosting mining hardware for clients in a remote location in exchange for a fixed fee usually denominated in fiat currency. This way, the cloud mining operator takes virtually no risk, while the client is left with the risk of the mining contract becoming unprofitable due to increasing mining difficulty or lower cryptocurrency prices. Although Genesis Mining’s FAQ section does specify that the company reserves the right to terminate a contract should the mining rewards of the contract be insufficient to cover the service fee, many users have voiced their frustration with the company. The company is now requesting existing users to upgrade their contracts in order to continue mining with Genesis, but has received mixed reactions from the community. Some are wondering why the company is now asking for more money to pay for the same hashrate as they had before: Strange you make it sound like I can upgrade my current btc contract, but in fact I’m paying paying twice for the same hashrate!? 🤔 the real deal would be if you gave us the option to convert our contracts without extra costs! #unbelievable Others, however, are questioning the company’s customer service: I am an early BTC customer! I'm so glad you can hear me! 😆SO HEAR THIS: MY TICKET #226915 REGARDING 0.1 BTC YOU ERASED FROM MY BALANCE WITHOUT SENDING TO MY WALLET IS OVER 1 YEAR OLD AND YOU STILL DIDN'T REFUND ME OR OFFERED A NEW CONTRACT IN THAT VALUE! DID YOU HEAR THAT? The company replied that “When you're asking us to upgrade you for free, technically you're asking us to connect you to the new set of miners we built out and unplug your current hardware. This isn't sustainable.” 3/3 With this offer we want our old customers to get a fair price for new capacities, but we also understand if this is not feasible for everyone.

However, the BTC price has moved back to above $6,000, which indicates a trend reversal could very well be in progress.  And yet, Cramer has still thrown in the Bitcoin towel. He even did so on the day that Bitcoin crossed a high of $6,259. So what gives? It’s difficult to say, as the crypto market is somewhat divided this week. Some are saying it’s game-over for Bitcoin, while others are confident BTC is eyeing a new target for bull reversal. For those believing Bitcoin is coming to an end, we have Jim Cramer.  On Tuesday, Cramer, who is the co-founder of the TheStreet, said to his CNBC audience that Bitcoin nearing 2018 lows suggests that the possibility of recovery is becoming less likely. Here, the 63-year-old former hedge fund manager is likely talking about the February low of $6,000, which, if the BTC price falls during the rest of the week, is possible of being hit.  Jim Cramer didn’t outright state that Bitcoin is broken, which is a notion Tom Lee has denied this month. He even made it clear that he’s “not saying its time has passed,” but simply that there is something suggesting “the sun seems to be setting” on the virtual currency. But is he right?  At press time, Bitcoin is selling for $6,356.38, which puts the coin down 0.70% in the past twenty-four hours.  The gist is this: if Bitcoin can move past $6,675, then it’s safe to say a bullish trend reversal has arrived. Sounds like a faraway goal based on today’s BTC activity, but let us not forget the coin jumped to $6,649 on Wednesday. ",40.5,1

With the market still in bearish territory, many traders have taken on short positions that would enable them to profit as the price continues to decline. Their idea is that since bitcoin has remained fairly stable over the past few days as the altcoins, including major coins like ether, litecoin, and EOS, have sold off heavily, it is bitcoin’s turn to fall next. Bitcoin price chart The relative strength that bitcoin has shown has also led to a spike in bitcoin’s overall dominance in the crypto market, recently reaching above 50% for the first time in 2018. Dominance rate Since the explosion in altcoin market capitalization occurred in mid-2017, bitcoin’s dominance rate has only reached the 50%-level for one brief period between late October and early December 2017. As such, traders may now be expecting to see bitcoin’s dominance fall again. However, many traders also know that when “everyone” in a market believes something is about to happen, history shows that the opposite instead tends to occur. Following that logic, a large number of short sellers in a market could in fact lead to higher prices – often in a very violent way. Bitcoin shorts reach record levels The total amount of BTC/USD short positions on the Bitfinex exchange is now reaching the highest levels in 12 months, while the short-to-long ratio is at its highest level since November 2017 at 1.3, as seen in the chart below: If the market starts to move upwards in the near future, many of these traders will exit their short positions by buying back bitcoins in the open market. As the price moves further up, even more short-sellers will get margin calls or hit their pre-set stop-loss levels, forcing them to cover their shorts, and creating a self-reinforcing mechanism that can cause sharp price increases. This is what traders refer to as a short squeeze. On Wednesday, Ran Neu-Ner, host of CNBC’s Cryptotrader show, also noted that bitcoin short positions are close to a 12-month high. He added that futures contracts traded at the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) are set to expire, which has previously caused extra volatility in the bitcoin market. Open short positions on Bitcoin are at a 12 month high today. There is also a CBOE futures close today.

The company had previously said that they hope the addition of cryptocurrencies will “enable a much broader group of investors worldwide” to participate. The cryptocurrencies that the company meant to accept were bitcoin and ether. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, High Times clarified that the announcement was a mistake and that they would not be accepting bitcoin. The filing does not mention ether at all. The filing states, “This press release was distributed in error as the Company will not be accepting bitcoin as payment for shares. As provided in the Company's subscription agreement related to the offering, the Company will only be accepting check, credit card, ACH or wire transfer as payment for subscription to shares.” High Times, which has been a mouthpiece for the pro-cannabis community since 1974, had previously claimed that “with a magazine and online presence still going strong, many are eager to grab some shares.” The first IPO that accepts cryptocurrencies could help crypto adoption, as the IPO market is measured in billions of dollars. For example, the US IPO market rebounded in 2017 as 133 domestic companies went public raising USD 30.4 billion, 33 more IPOs and 79% greater value than the previous year, according to Mergermarket, M&A intelligence, data and research company.

Speaking about bitcoin futures, Concannon noted that trading in bitcoin futures is still low compared to mature assets such as gold or oil. Insufficient trading volume, in turn, makes the SEC hesitant to approve an ETF, although the introduction of an ETF backed by futures would significantly increase the trading volume in the underlying futures contracts. “It’s a chicken-and-egg problem,” he said. Back in June, the CBOE filed a proposal for an ETF on behalf of financial firm VanEck. This is the only such ETF that aims to be fully backed by physical bitcoins rather than bitcoin futures contracts. Some experts claim that bitcoin custody is the crucial issue for bitcoin ETF. Meanwhile, nine other ETFs backed by bitcoin futures are also pending decisions by the SEC. The fact that the ETF was filed through a veteran financial institution such as the CBOE, and that it will hold real bitcoins in its reserves, has made the entire cryptocurrency community particularly excited about the prospects of this particular ETF.

He added that he can't say whether this is the ""long-awaited capitulation of the HODL crowd or not"", but ""capitulation would be a good thing for the crypto markets, releasing assets into the market that until now have been locked up by long-term holders.” Meanwhile, the social network Reddit is filled to bursting with posts such as: “The ‘HODL’ meme is a cancer in the cryptocurrency space,” or “You people HODLing-only, are your own worst enemy.” The most common argument is that HODLing doesn’t help the trading volume. “How do you expect to see volume and money coming in, when you don't want to contribute to it? It is literally the same thing as the bystander effect. ‘Oh I won't help, I'm sure someone else will’,” writes user u/PhillyCrypto. User u/niftythrow argues that, “HODL only works in a bull market.” The recently published survey showed that 70% of the respondents believe that hodling is more important than spending. Also, the survey found that with bitcoin, 73% spend it ‘almost never’, ethereum - 82%, and litecoin - 89%. 46% of the respondents are of the opinion that the lack of places o spend crypto contributed to the price decline. Meanwhile, others now argue that capitulating isn’t the way to go either. “If you can't stomach a negative asset, you're not for crypto,” says user u/cyrilbenson47. This is almost the same what Charlie Lee of Litecoin tweeted about a year ago: “If you can’t stomach a 90 percent drop in crypto, don’t adopt early.” Those that dropped out, being unable to stomach the losses, shared their stories as well: they mostly invested more than they could afford to lose - something that is incredibly easy to do - and the stress got the best of them. “You can’t put a price on stress levels and your mental health,” writes u/tksopinion. Through all the posts, the community is still trying to remain optimistic and give a little hope to those who are sick and tired of the bear run. How effective this approach will be remains to be seen. In the meantime, bitcoin and altcoins nosedive:",-87.94999999999982,0

With the hashtag #findsatoshi, Neff has now taken to the popular Russian crowdfunding website Boomstarter where he is hoping to raise nearly a quarter of a million US dollars to help in the search of the Bitcoin creator. Although people have been searching for Satoshi’s true identity for years without getting any closer to the truth, Neff insists on finding him: “Satoshi needs to be found […] Was it really an enthusiast who gave the world an independent currency or was it a group of people pursuing scientific or purely selfish purposes? Or perhaps Bitcoin is an invention of a large company or an IT giant that decided to take a new direction? Can Bitcoin be the state invention, created with the purpose to control all transactions? There are many assumptions as to who might be behind this, but neither theory has been confirmed.” Neff claims he has been collecting information about Satoshi over the past three years. Having already raised USD 100,000, Neff’s target of a quarter million dollars could be within reach. Driven by his admirable determination, Mr. Neff plans on spending the money to hire private detectives from places like Japan, New York, London, and Russia in one of the biggest search efforts to date for the bitcoin creator. “We, the crypto-enthusiasts, are obliged to find out the truth in order to exist peacefully in this environment. Without the fear that tomorrow a man will come out from behind the curtains announcing that the circus is over and then will disappear again […] We have the right to know the identity of Satoshi,” Mr. Neff and his group wrote on the crowdfunding website.

The most recent declines for the Turkish lira came as a result of a trade dispute with US President Donald Trump, who on Friday announced via Twitter that he had “authorized a doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum with respect to Turkey.”  As the two governments battle it out over sanctions and trade tariffs, ordinary citizens, however, are forced to look for ways to preserve whatever money they may have saved up.  A Reddit user, supposedly from Turkey wrote that awareness about bitcoin is now spreading quickly in Turkey, and that online discussion forums that used to deal with dollar exchange rates are now increasingly used to spread bitcoin charts and investment ideas. However, the same user added that Turkish people still need to get more educated on the issue, and suggested that social media campaigns aimed at increasing knowledge about bitcoin in the country could be very effective. Volume surges on Turkish exchanges According to data from Coinmarketcap.com, Turkish bitcoin exchange BTCTurk has seen an increase in trading volume of 110% over the past seven days, while local competitor Paribu is up by roughly 125% over the same time period. Peer-to-peer trading data also shows increased interest in bitcoin: Measured in Turkish Lira, bitcoin has gained roughly 65% since it bottomed in late June, with the sharpest increases seen over the past few days, according to price data from Bitfinex. And with the lira continuing to spiral downwards, the trend of more Turkish currency being converted into bitcoin is likely to continue. Meanwhile, the South African rand touched a two-year low amidst widespread worries in the market that the situation in Turkey could spill over to other emerging market currencies. The South African rand has long been under heavy pressure, and various media outlets have for months reported that the uncertain situation in the country has benefitted bitcoin, despite the government’s skepticism. Back in Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan over the weekend optimistically asked citizens of his country to convert US dollars and gold into Turkish lira as soon as possible to help the deteriorating situation for the country’s currency.  “Change the euros, the dollars and the gold that you are keeping beneath your pillows into lira at our banks. This is a domestic and national struggle,” Erdogan said, while referring to the US tariffs as an “economic war.”  However, other than telling citizens that the US have “their dollars” and we have “our god,” Erdogan offered little assurance to people who are wondering why they should choose to hold a currency that has depreciated by roughly 45% against the US dollar since the start of the year. Luckily for many people in Turkey, Turkish banks still accept dealings with bitcoin exchanges, meaning cryptocurrency can be bought for local currency on online exchanges. This differs from the situation in Iran, China, and other countries where cryptocurrency trading can happen through peer-to-peer marketplaces such as Localbitcoins.com due to government restrictions. As reported by Cryptonews.com, while cryptocurrencies may look like a refuge for people in struggling economies, there's still no concrete evidence of just how safe they'll be over the long term.",-43.789999999999964,0

In a series of eight tweets on Sunday,  he explained his thoughts on the current bear market in crypto. 1/ Why is #crypto falling so much in 2018? Because in 2017 the market was up > 30x, but adoption (beyond investing & trading) wasn’t concurrently up 30x. Burniske, who became somewhat of a pioneer on the topic of cryptoasset valuation with his 2017 book Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond, further said that the market right now is about “10x above January 2017 prices,” while asking if adoption has also grown 10x since then. “On the bright side,” he wrote, crypto will eventually consolidate and we will enter “a new J-curve era.” 4/ On the bright side, as we eventually consolidate #crypto will be entering a new J-curve era 🙂 https://t.co/L4BLHBnC0U Burniske is not alone stressing the importance of adoption. Recently, Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of the Ethereum platform, said that “there's too much emphasis on BTC/ETH/whatever ETFs, and not enough emphasis on making it easier for people to buy $5 to $100 in cryptocurrency via cards at corner stores. The former is better for pumping price, but the latter is much better for actual adoption.” Adoption is a hot topic in the crypto universe. Recent market research has shown that the vast majority of people have no intention of using their cryptocurrency. Instead, they just want to hodl and wait until the prices go up so that they may buy more fiat later on. Meanwhile, Burniske ended his thread by asking what the best fundamental indicators for crypto prices would be, Twitter users responded with suggestions such as “Net capital inflows, GitHub [activity], and political instability,” while others offered “Google search volume” and cryptocurrency integration with merchants as useful metrics. Lastly, one creative Twitter user proposed “usage data of anti-depressants by crypto hodlers” as the most reliable metric to look at in order to understand crypto price movements. In his work on cryptoasset valuation, Chris Burniske has argued that merely looking at market cap can be misleading when it comes to cryptoassets, and that “network value-to-transactions ratio” is the best metric we have for valuing cryptoassets.

While some see a potential corrective rally occurring, others believe the cryptocurrency is at the end of its road. One Wall Street analyst believes the latter. In fact, Jeff deGraaf said it’s “game over” for Bitcoin. But is that true? Yesterday, CNBC reported that Jeff deGraaf of Renaissance Macro Research declared that Bitcoin is “permanently impaired.” He then added that investors should start betting against the cryptocurrency, but only if it breaks through its year-to-date support. There are a lot of people in the crypto community that cause panic when it’s not needed, but deGraaf is not one of those people. Being a respected Wall Street chart technician, the man knows the subject he is speaking on quite well. There’s no denying that the Bitcoin market has taken a hit over the past three weeks. After hitting a high of $8,450 in July, Bitcoin has dropped back down to the $6,000 level. But despite analysts like Jeff deGraaf thinking it’s game-over for Bitcoin, there are people like Tom Lee who remain confident that Bitcoin is not broken. In fact, the Bitcoin Misery Index appears to indicate so. The crypto market is one big game of speculation. People are always going to have different opinions on the direction of the market. Therefore, the best thing to do is to keep an eye on crypto prices yourself. Here’s what the numbers are telling us on Friday, August 10th. At press time, Bitcoin is selling for $6,474.43, which puts the coin down 0.26% in the past twenty-four hours. Today’s close is going to be very important. If Bitcoin can close above $6,628, then it’s likely that Tom Lee is correct when he said Bitcoin isn’t broken. However, if the BTC price closes below $6,183 today, then the words spoken by deGraaf yesterday are likely true. What do you think about what deGraaf said? Is it really game-over for Bitcoin?

In an emailed statement to Cryptonews.com, Newton said that “the lingering question mark for the SEC is around bitcoin custody,” adding that “to approve the decision, they’d need to do so in the knowledge that the ETF was backed by physical bitcoin – either stored by the CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange) or a third party.” He further said that the financial institutions now moving into the crypto space will have to decide whether they want to develop their own storage and custody solutions, or if they instead want to work with players in the crypto space that are already offering such services. “We could even start to see consolidation in the market with heavyweight finance houses acquiring crypto companies. Goldman Sachs has already begun deliberations over custody, so watch this space,” the market analyst said, referring to a recent report from Bloomberg that the veteran investment bank is looking into offering custody services for its clients. Also, according to Google Trends, public interest in the issue of bitcoin custody is growing again: Meanwhile, search interest for the term “bitcoin etf” reached its peak for the year in the last week of July: In either case, the search term “bitcoin etf” is much more popular than “bitcoin custody”: Ten Bitcoin ETFs Pending SEC Decision In addition to the filing by VanEck, made through CBOE, nine other bitcoin-based ETF applications are currently being reviewed by the SEC.  The SEC is required to make an initial decision on the applications within 45 days after they have been published in the US Federal Register. Given current rules, however, the regulator can push back its decisions several times, which means that we may not have a decision on VanEck’s ETF proposal until February next year. The next deadline for the SEC to decide on a bitcoin ETF is August 23, when it is set to decide the fate of a proposal from ProShares, a well-established provider of ETFs in the US. ProShares’ proposal includes two ETFs, one that would let investors bet on the bitcoin price going up, and another that would offer short exposure, meaning investors can profit when the bitcoin price goes down. However, rather than holding actual bitcoins, the ProShares ETF would be holding bitcoin futures contracts. Judging from the comments of eToro’s Matthew Newton and others, the other nine filings may have slim chances of getting an approval, given the fact that the VanEck ETF is the only one backed by physical bitcoins held in custody.  In Newton’s own words, “along with regulatory oversight, this question of custody will determine the next big move in the market.”",-386.71000000000004,0

The study, named “Risks and Returns of Cryptocurrencies” was carried out on three major cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin, Ripple and Ethereum – by calculating the Sharpe ratio, a measure for the performance of an asset adjusted for risk and volatility. The ratio provides a mathematical method to compare how different assets compensate the investor for the risk taken, making different assets more comparable. The price data examined for Bitcoin was the most comprehensive, spanning from 2011 to 2018. For Ripple and Ethereum, the price data began in 2012 and 2015, respectively. At the monthly frequency, the Sharpe ratios of bitcoin are similar to those of stocks for the comparable time period, although higher than the historical Sharpe ratios for stocks, the study found. Meanwhile, at the daily and weekly frequencies, the ratios are about 50% and 75% higher than those of stocks for the comparable time period.  The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better an asset is compensating an investor for the associated risk. The comparison of the Sharpe ratios
Stock* shows results for the whole sample between 1953/07 and 2018/04. Below are the Sharpe ratios for Ethereum and Ripple, as presented in the study: _______ _______ The two scholars behind the study, economist Aleh Tsyvinski and Ph.D. candidate Yukun Liu, further found that cryptocurrencies do not behave in a fashion similar to stocks, fiat currencies, or precious metals, and that it is therefore necessary to use other methods than those traditionally used to predict performance. Two trading strategies Two phenomena the researchers found to be useful in terms of predicting the performance of cryptocurrencies include the “momentum effect” and an effect they referred to as “investor attention.” Investor attention could essentially be thought of as the level of hype among people. For example, an abnormally high number of Google searches or tweets about positive things related to cryptocurrencies such as “buy bitcoin,” tends to generate higher returns in bitcoin. Likewise, high numbers of searches on things like “bitcoin hack” tends to lower returns for holders of that asset. Tsyvinski told CNBC in an interview that ""for weekly returns, the Google search proxy statistically significantly predicts 1-week and 2-week ahead returns."" The momentum effect is another phenomenon well-known in finance, which basically says that an asset that has gone up in price, tends to continue up, simply as a result of more and more investors jumping on the bandwagon.  To take advantage of the momentum effect in bitcoin, the two researchers developed a simple trading strategy that says a trader should buy bitcoin if its price increases more than 20% in the previous week, and sell seven days later. “This strategy generates outstanding returns and a very high Sharpe ratio,” the two were quoted by Yale University’s news portal as saying. Lastly, the pair claims to have debunked the myth that the cost of mining can predict cryptocurrency prices, as experts such as Tom Lee argues for. “We were surprised to see that it does not predict cryptocurrency returns,” the scholars said.",262.66999999999916,1

Canaan’s AvalonMiner A9 is reportedly capable of hashing rates of up to 30 TH/s, or more than double that of the current top model from Bitmain. In cryptocurrency mining, hash rate is the speed at which a mining machine can operate. A higher hash rate would allow a machine to get more mining rewards over a given period of time. The new bitcoin miner was announced at a Canaan press conference on Wednesday and later confirmed on the company’s Chinese WeChat account.  However, Steven Mosher, global head of sales and marketing at Canaan, revealed the details of the new miner in a Facebook post earlier, and added that the new miner will start shipping in the 4th quarter of this year: Mosher did not immediately respond to a request for more details.

With the new machine, Canaan will take the lead from fellow Chinese rival Bitmain, which is set to hold an initial public offering (IPO) on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in September. Earlier, it has been reported that Canaan has also applied for an IPO in Hong Kong this year. It is speculated that the amount raised through these IPOs will be a good indicator in the general interest in the future of mining and thus cryptocurrency in general.  Just last week, Canaan announced that they are bringing a TV set that doubles as a bitcoin miner to market. However, with a hashing power of 2.8 TH/s, the new TV is still a far cry from the company’s new flagship bitcoin miner.

While regular ATMs have long been a target for criminals, fraud related to bitcoin ATMs have so far not become much of a thing. Now, according to the firm, it turns out that for about USD 25,000, criminals can purchase bitcoin ATM malware through online forums. The software reportedly allows a fraudster to receive bitcoins worth up to USD 6,750 each time it is used, by “exploiting a service vulnerability in the bitcoin ATM.” According to the seller, the malware ships with a card with a built-in chip and near field communication functionality (NFC) “ready-to-use,” and “does not require any physical access.” The same seller, which appears to be a well-respected member of an underground online forum, also offers various forms of malware for traditional bank ATMs, as well as forged documents on everything from taxes to credit reports.  The particular seller has reportedly received over 100 reviews from customers online, indicating that the expensive piece of malware has generated a substantial income for him, and that it is already being used in several locations around the world.

If approved, many believe this could propel the cryptocurrency market to another level—very similar to what the Bitcoin futures were anticipated to do. Bitcoin ETFs would, in fact, help to bring in more institutional investors, where the real money is. Adoption is key to the longevity of cryptocurrency, and the SEC knows that the decision shouldn’t be made swiftly.

The SEC wrote in its statement that they have so far received more than 1,300 comments from the public on the proposed rule change that would be necessary in order to list the ETF on an exchange. Tuesday’s notice from the SEC would give the regulator until September 30 to decide on whether it will approve or disapprove the proposed rule change. Although many market commentators and investors had already expressed that they expected the decision to be pushed back several times, the market reacted by sending the bitcoin price further down. Bitcoin overnight broke through a technical support found at the USD 6,700 level and is currently (UTC 4:40 AM)  trading at around USD 6,500.

True, the Tom Lee Bitcoin price target did change from $25 thousand to $20 thousand last month, but the Fundstrat co-founder is still confident. In fact, Lee remains confident because of what the Fundstrat Bitcoin Misery Index is indicating. On Monday, Tom Lee went against the Bitcoin bears, announcing that no, Bitcoin “isn’t broken,” even if it stays at the current price—which, at press time, is $7,120.73. He also said that Bitcoin is not broken if it’s holding at the current volatility levels. But why does Tom Lee think that? Well, it boils down to what the Bitcoin Misery Index is describing. Back in March, Fundstrat launched the Bitcoin Misery Index, which is essentially a way for investors to know if holders of the coin are ‘miserable’ or not. It’s all based on volatility and price. According to Lee, the Bitcoin Misery Index’s current number is 39, which means it is neither in ‘good’ territory nor ‘selling’ territory. If the index falls below 27, it means future returns are good. No one has to panic (like how people do in the crypto space when prices drop). However, if the index moves past 68%, then you know that it is ‘time to sell’ the cryptocurrency. Despite being higher than 27, Lee thinks the index shows that momentum is en route to recovery. In the interview, Lee pointed out that the crypto industry has seen good things come out recently, in terms of Bitcoin. For instance, the SEC has declared Bitcoin not to be a security. Not to mention the ICE announcing last week its intent to create an integrated virtual assets platform. Huge, considering ICE is the operator of dozens of exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange. There are three things I want to ask: first, do you agree with the $20 thousand Tom Lee price target? Two: Do you believe the Fundstrat Bitcoin Misery Index?

However, the study assumes that ransomware authors cashed out immediately after receiving victims’ payments, which left them with “only” USD 12.8 million in their pockets. The study, titled “Ransomware in the Bitcoin Ecosystem”,  has been released by the researchers who are part of TITANIUM, an international project focused on crime and terrorism involving virtual currencies and underground market transactions. The analysis indicates there are ""clear inequalities in the market, which could be considered as a top-heavy market in which only a few players are responsible for most of the ransom payments."" Below are the Top 15 ransomware families by received payments.  The Locky ransomware accounts for more than 50% of the ransomware payments and the first three families account for 86% of the market while the other 32 families share the remaining 12%, the researchers concluded.  Also, the study adds that the incoming transactions of 12 ransomware families range from very low payments up to USD 2,000. Three ransomware families have higher payments on average: DMALockerv3, GlobeImposter and SamSam. In January 2016, DMALockerv3 was known to ask for ransom payments of 15 BTC (which was equivalent to USD 6491.25). The SamSam ransomware was also known to ask ransoms based on the number of machines infected and the ransom could go from 1.7 BTC (at the time USD 4,600) to decrypt a given machine up to 12 BTC (at the time USD 32,800) to decrypt all machines infected. “Famous ransomware campaigns are likely to be a short-term, one-time deal, in which a ransomware author makes money quickly and then stops, possibly due to various forms of security interventions,” the authors said. Longitudinal payment trend per ransomware family: ""With over 500 known ransomware families, it has become one of the dominant cybercrime threats for law enforcement, security professionals and the public,"" the study says. However, it concludes “that the total ransom amounts gathered through ransomware attacks are relatively low compared to the hype surrounding this issue.""

Per industry organization the Russian Association of Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain, the number of new companies created to mine Bitcoin and altcoins in the country has risen by 15% since the start of this year, with 75,000 organizations and 350,000 people in the country with population of 144 million now involved in the mining industry. However, profitability has nosedived in the same period. News outlet Segodnya quotes economist and bitcoin investor Tuur Demeester as stating that Russian mining profits may have decreased by a whopping 90% in the first half of 2018, due in no small part to increasing competition in the country. Yet declining profitability appears to be doing little to dampen the enthusiasm many Russians now have for cryptocurrency mining. RusCable reports that an energy provider in Vologda Oblast, in the north of the country, recently discovered a cryptocurrency mine operating in a 47sqm apartment in the city of Cherepovets. The provider, Vologdaenergo, says the apartment was uninhabited, but had been filled with mining hardware, using up some USD 360 worth of electricity a month. Electricity prices in the region are among the lowest in the world: 1 Kilowatt hour of electricity in Vologda Oblast typically costs between USD 0.03 and USD 0.06. As reported, not only in Russia bitcoin miners have seen their profitability plummet as of late, while some miners had to unload their coins to cover some of their losses. Also, with cryptocurrency mining consuming an ever-increasing amount of energy worldwide, some politicians are starting a push for higher electricity rates for miners, arguing that their activities offer “no utility for society.”",-205.19999999999982,0

However, China may help bitcoin, he adds. Despite many people having called a bottom in bitcoin prices at around the USD 5,700 level seen in June, Demeester argues that on-chain activity on the bitcoin network still does not support its current valuation.  Demeester, who first recommended bitcoin as an investment when it was at USD 5 in 2012, writes in the article that bitcoin miners have faced a decline in profitability of 90% over the course of 7 months. He goes on to explain that miners therefore are forced to sell off a large portion of their mining rewards just to cover their operating expenses. Bitcoin price chart: Next, Demeester predicts that we might have to wait until next year before a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund is approved in the US. Although he acknowledges that there has been a strong uptick in institutional interest for bitcoin this year, Demeester points out that most of that interest comes from trading firms and market makers. In other words, these are institutions that don’t necessarily hold bitcoin as an investment, but rather makes money off of the volatility or by making markets. “Institutions who are known to be long biased, such as mutual funds and pension funds are not ready to invest because they’re not yet comfortable with the available custody solutions,” Demeester argued in his article, shared with more than 170,000 of his followers on Twitter. Despite his no-so-positive outlook on price this year, Demeester also sees several positive developments that could trigger a price rally.  Among these is the possibility that we could see a new wave of Chinese capital flowing into bitcoin as a result of depreciation of the Chinese yuan this year. Due to capital controls in the country, bitcoin is an attractive option used by some people to move capital out of the country.",-111.13999999999942,0

The Wall Street Journal said it had identified 105 groups on chatting apps Telegram and Discord offering “trading signals,” a type of service that is often associated with pump-and-dumps. In total, the WSJ said that between January and the end of July it identified 175 “pump and dump” schemes involving 121 different digital coins, which show a sudden rise in price and an equally sudden fall minutes later. The report mentions coins such as version, cloakcoin, granitecoin, pesetacoin, stealth, and agrello.  Among the pump-and-dump groups examined by the newspaper, the biggest group – identified as “Big Pump Signal” - had more than 74,000 members in its Telegram channel. Since December, the group has reportedly initiated 26 pumps, totaling around USD 222 million in trading activity. For example, on July 1, after followers of Big Pump Signal were commanded to start buying a token called cloakcoin, the price jumped 50% to USD 5.77 on Binance, a major exchange, before dropping almost a dollar after two minutes, according to the report. In total, 6,700 trades worth USD 1.7 million were executed—compared with virtually no trading the hour before, it added, saying that one user claimed he made USD 1,400 on this pump without going “big”. Cloakcoin price chart: Many of the groups charge monthly fees of USD 50 to USD 250 or require members to evangelize the service for access to trading information, the WSJ said. Pump-and-dump schemes are among the oldest forms of fraud in financial markets and can happen either by traders talking up the price of a particular asset before they cash in on it, or by a group of traders getting together to buy an asset, driving up the price in the process. Once the price has reached the pumpers target, they rush to sell, leaving behind the unknowing traders who bought in. Although pump-and-dumps have long been outlawed in traditional financial markets, they still persist to some degree. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regularly goes after groups that profit from the activity, particularly in the very small so-called micro-cap stocks. In crypto, however, regulators have yet to bring up even a single case against the fraudsters behind these schemes. One problem faced by regulators is that it can be difficult to determine who has jurisdiction over the markets where the fraud takes place. As a largely unregulated market, crypto is traded without regard to national borders and by traders who sometimes stay anonymous, meaning it is an almost impossible task for regulators to take on. Essentially a zero-sum game, a pump-and-dump transfers money from those who jump on the bandwagon when they see the price of an asset gain momentum, to those who initiated the dump. In reality though, it is often only the initiator of the pump signal that is able to sell off the asset with a profit before it’s too late.  As reported, bitcoin price manipulation has already put trust in cryptocurrencies at risk. According to professor Neil Gandal and assistant professor Tyler Moore, exchanges should do more to mitigate this problem, for example by sharing information about the trading behavior of very large traders on their platforms. “The consequence of not taking steps in this direction is likely a loss of faith in cryptocurrencies,” the two scholars wrote in an article.",-111.13999999999942,0

However, that might be about to change. Starbucks just hinted that it might soon have a way to make using BTC to pay for coffee a whole lot easier for its loyalists. Currently, it’s possible to buy Starbucks coffee with Bitcoin, but it isn’t an easy process. The global coffee giant in the past teamed up with Square, which accepts Bitcoin. However, it isn’t as easy as whipping out your iPhone and paying with the Starbucks app or even your debit card. But will that be changing soon? According to Bloomberg, the beverage retailer has just teamed up with the world’s biggest exchange operator, Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE) to create Bakkt. Reports surfaced back in May of ICE working on a Bitcoin trading platform. This morning, ICE officially announced the creation of Bakkt. CEO of Bakkt, Kelly Loeffler, commented on her company in the press release and said: “Bakkt is designed to serve as a scalable on-ramp for institutional, merchant and consumer participation in digital assets by promoting greater efficiency, security, and utility. We are collaborating to build an open platform that helps unlock the transformative potential of digital assets across global markets and commerce.” In the press release, the company announced that it was working with Microsoft, BCG, and Starbucks on its new company Bakkt. It remains unknown how Bakkt plans on reducing the high fees associated with Bitcoin transactions, which make using Bitcoin for everyday purchases, like a cup of coffee, rather inconvenient. “As the flagship retailer, Starbucks will play a pivotal role in developing practical, trusted and regulated applications for consumers to convert their digital assets into US dollars for use at Starbucks,” said Starbucks Payments VP Maria Smith in a statement. “As a leader in Mobile Pay to our more than 15 million Starbucks Rewards members, Starbucks is committed to innovation for expanding payment options for our customers.” Many believe that this is big news for the cryptocurrency as the big question for most is, “Where can you spend it?” Currently, there seems to be some demand to make it easier to accept digital currencies, although Starbucks wouldn’t be the first retailer to accept them. Overstock.com started accepting Bitcoin back in 2014. Still, the high fees have yet to be addressed, so, we’ll just have to wait and see. Featured Image: Twitter",-127.75,0

Earlier in 2018, the bank said it was planning on opening a BTC trading desk. Yesterday, a former Goldman Sachs executive said a Bitcoin ETF was possible. Yet, in the Goldman Sachs midyear economic-outlook report, Bitcoin was reported to decline even more than it has so far already this year. According to the bank’s investment strategy group, Bitcoin’s price has declined by 45% this year, and it’s not going to stop anytime soon. Why, though? Sure, we’ve all seen the price dips. However, we’ve also seen what it can do when BTC is having a good day. According to Goldman Sachs’ investment strategy group, there will be further declines in cryptocurrencies because they do not match the conventional expectations of what a currency is supposed to be. First, Bitcoin is not a medium of exchange, according to the bank. Second, cryptocurrencies are not a unit of measurement. And third, they are not a store of value. Yes and no. If you’re interested in the activity of broader financial assets, cryptocurrency declines shouldn’t impact your life too much. Why? Because “cryptocurrencies represent just 0.3% of world GDP as of mid-2018.” For the most part, the New York-based company has expressed bearish views on cryptocurrency, which lines up with the Goldman Sachs midyear economic-outlook report. Back in November, CEO Lloyd Blankfein said BTC is not a valid currency and is a way to “perpetrate fraud.” Then in January, the bank warned investors that Bitcoin was in bubble territory. Here’s where the different opinions come in. Fast forward to May of 2018 and Goldman Sachs announced its intent to launch Bitcoin futures contracts. Fast forward even more to August of 2018 and a former executive for the bank, Ali Hassan, said a Bitcoin ETF is very likely to happen. That said, Hassan did say that this will only happen once the digital asset proves it doesn’t pose a risk to investors.

Bakkt aims to offer a federally regulated market for Bitcoin, transforming Bitcoin into a trusted global currency with broad usage.  Yowza. As mentioned, ICE is not acting alone. The new venture also involves heavyweights in the form of Microsoft (technology), Starbucks (retail), and Boston Consulting Group (consulting).

However, some politicians are trying to include this topic in their agenda. The most recent example comes from Norway. In a segment aired by Norwegian public broadcaster NRK on Thursday, a local crypto mining firm known as KryptoVault AS were attacked by Lars Haltbrekken, a left-wing member of parliament in Norway, referring to mining as “an enormous waste of resources that perhaps could have been used for something reasonable instead.” KryptoVault’s representative, former member of parliament Gjermund Hagesæter, defended their activity by pointing out that the alternative for them and other miners in the country would be to move the mining operations to other countries with more polluting energy sources such as coal. Countries with plentiful and cheap energy coming from renewable sources have seen a large influx of crypto miners as of late, with Canada, the northeastern US, and the Nordic countries being among the most popular locations. The sentiment expressed in the debate is not unique to Norway, but can be found in countries all around the world. In March, Plattsburgh, a small town in New York State, banned the launch of new bitcoin mining firms for 18 months and in May it received a permission to impose extremely high-density load tariffs on bitcoin miners. While China is already known for its policy against bitcoin mining, in Iceland, the finance minister has warned that cryptocurrency mining could severely damage its economy.  Also, back in June, Hydro-Quebec, Canada’s biggest electricity provider, said it had temporarily suspended new requests from crypto miners after demand had reached a point where their ability to supply power to the region could be affected. Meanwhile, politicians are playing the bitcoin mining card at times when mining profitability decreased together with bitcoin prices this year. As reported by Cryptonews.com earlier, bitcoin miners have seen their profitability plummet as of late, while some miners had to unload their coins to cover some of their losses.",-127.75,0

The price is currently (UTC 08:50 AM) recovering towards the USD 7,480 and USD 7,550 resistance levels. Major altcoins like ethereum, EOS and bitcoin cash are under a lot of pressure and they recently declined to new monthly lows. Bitcoin price chart: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price remained in a bearish zone and traded below the USD 7,550 and USD 7,400 support levels. However, BTC/USD tested a significant support near USD 7,275, which is likely to act as a crucial turning point. If the price starts recovering, it must clear the USD 7,550 resistance to move back in a positive zone. 
On the other hand, if the price fails to recover and breaks the USD 7,250 - USD 7,275 support, it could decline towards USD 7,000. Ethereum
Ethereum price traded to a new weekly and monthly low below USD 400. ETH/USD found support near USD 396 and later recovered. It is currently trading above USD 405 with an immediate resistance at USD 415. Above this, the next hurdle is at USD 425.
On the downside, the USD 396 - USD 400 zone holds the key support, below which, the price may perhaps slide towards USD 375. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price fell sharply and broke the USD 740 and USD 720 supports. BCH/USD tested the USD 700 support and is currently down more than 5%. If it slides further, the next support awaits at USD 675. On the upside, resistances are at USD 720 and USD 740.
Ripple price held the ground and declines were limited in XRP/USD. The pair is currently consolidating above USD 0.42 and it seems like it could correct higher in the near term. Other Altcoins Market Today

Gox’s bankruptcy proceedings now put on hold in Tokyo, a civil rehabilitation case has begun in which creditors are attempting to get back whatever is left from the collapse of the infamous exchange. In a revised version of a document dubbed “Basic Policy for the Rehabilitation Plan,” Japanese lawyers representing creditors of the Mt. Gox collapse proposed that remaining assets held by Mt. Gox should be distributed exclusively to creditors, not shareholders. Further, the lawyers propose that creditors who had bitcoins deposited on the Mt. Gox exchange at the time of the collapse, should be reimbursed in bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH).  “We are of the opinion that most of the assets, including approximately BTC 166,000 (USD 1.2bn) and 168,000 of BCH (USD 120m) and other derivatives currently held by Mt. Gox, should be paid to creditors at the time of the first payment,” according to the document. The group argues that this is the best option in order to avoid negatively affecting bitcoin prices on the open market, which could be a real possibility if the enormous pile of bitcoins held by Mt. Gox’s trustee first needs to be converted to fiat currencies. The group added that cash Mt. Gox already holds following earlier selling of BTC and BCH should be paid out to creditors in cash without first exchanging it back into cryptocurrency. With regards to altcoins, defined in the document as “cryptocurrency except for BTC and BCH,” the lawyers point out that it is “unrealistic” to repay altcoins to bitcoin creditors due to the limited number of exchanges that deals with altcoins. The document therefore proposes that altcoins should be exchanged to cash before it is paid out to creditors. The group further urges the trustee holding Mt. Gox’s assets to proceed with caution when it comes to making transactions with altcoins and selling them on the open market, citing concerns related to security and the possibility that a sale could cause “a sudden fall in the price of altcoins.” Launched in 2010, Mt. Gox handled more than 70% of bitcoin transactions worldwide at its peak, before collapsing in a spectacular fashion in 2014, causing losses amounting to hundreds of millions of US dollars.",-127.75,0

Joni Teves, UBS strategist, wrote in the letter that bitcoin in her view “is still too unstable and limited to become a viable means of payment or a mainstream asset class,” while also saying that the efforts by developers to address technical limitations such as scalability and speed have been “insufficient.” According to Teves, bitcoin will need additional regulatory support, as well as various consumer safeguards in order to become a future form of payment and a “legitimate asset class.”  Also, Teves found that 70% of big bitcoin price moves were results of speculative ""momentum-driven"" interest. Bitcoin price chart: The report further pointed out that bitcoin today can only process a fraction of the transaction volume that traditional payment providers like Visa can do.  However, solutions such as the Lightning network are emerging that would solve this problem. In this case, transacting and settling would be done off-blockchain, so the fees are low and thanks to the implementation of smart contracts for security, the payments can be instant - no waiting time for block confirmation. Also, another important factor is its scalability, which is supposed to make it possible for millions to billions of transactions per second to take place across the network.  Teves did not, however, address other key characteristics of bitcoin such as it being a censorship-resistant store of value, open to everyone, and free from inflation and government interference. Also, when all 21 million bitcoins are mined by the year 2140, the actual amount available to trade or spend will be significantly lower.

With a hashing power of 2.8 trillion hashes per second, the company is betting on increased retail demand for bitcoin mining rigs, the South China Morning Post reported. However, the new TV set, known under the name AvalonMiner Inside, is still a far cry from the company’s most powerful bitcoin mining machine in terms of computing power – the AvalonMiner 841 with 13 trillion hashes per second, that retails for USD 618. The report did not specify, when the 43-inch TV set is going to be available in the market and how much it would cost. According to cryptocompare.com, a machine with a hashing power of 2.8 trillion hashes per second could mine BTC 0.04319 (USD 331 at current prices) per year. However, the report did not specify power consumption numbers. Canaan’s TV set can reportedly be controlled by voice commands and is able to calculate bitcoin mining profitability in real time. The new product is the first in a planned new range of blockchain-related home appliances from Canaan, the newspaper wrote. Although it is certainly a creative idea, early reactions from the bitcoin community reveals some skepticism. Beijing-based bitcoin analyst Xiao Lei was quoted in the article as saying “it looks more like a hype. It will be more meaningful if these companies are able to embed the mining function into existing major TV brands.” Canaan Creative is the world’s second biggest maker of bitcoin mining rigs, following Bitmain Technologies. Both companies are headquartered in Beijing, China. The news comes after Canaan earlier this year filed an application to list the company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, where the hardware maker is aiming to raise up to USD 1 billion through an initial public offering (IPO). Canaan reported revenues of USD 205 million last year, an increase of an astonishing 27 times from the year before. The company sold nearly 300,000 mining machines last year, with the US and Sweden being among its biggest markets.

Bitcoin price is trading flat near the USD 7,650 level with an immediate resistance at USD 7,700.

He’s a Nobel Prize winner in Economics, Distinguished Professor of Economics at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and a columnist for The New York Times.
He’s also a crypto skeptic. In his latest column for the New York Times, he argues that cryptocurrency is at least 300 years behind the current, let’s call it traditional monetary system.  He says crypto is too expensive to create, transactions are frictive, costs of doing business are high. On the other hand, conventional money ‘generally does its job very well’, he argues.  “Transaction costs are low. The purchasing power of a dollar a year from now is highly predictable – orders of magnitude more predictable than that of a Bitcoin. Using a bank account means trusting a bank, but by and large banks justify that trust, far more so than the firms that hold cryptocurrency tokens.” He acknowledges, that he might be wrong and ends his article this way: ""If you want to argue that I’m wrong, please answer the question, what problem does cryptocurrency solve? Don’t just try to shout down the skeptics with a mixture of technobabble and libertarian derp."" The internet replied, in kind.  Truth be told, most of the answers revolved around discrediting Krugman, without really answering the question. Once again, people started pulling out his old predictions, like when he said that the internet’s effect on the economy by 2005 will be no greater than the fax machine’s. (Same argument was used in 2013, when Krugman wrote a piece called ""Bitcoin is Evil"".

Others were straight-up savage, like this redditor who said: “That's a bullish sign, that guy is always wrong,” or one person on Twitter that stated “another old man yells at bitcoin.” But there were also more concrete answers. Some tried to keep it short and concise, for everyone to understand: “At the simplest level it solves irreversible value transfer at a distance without a middle man.” Others have stated that bitcoin can move hundreds of millions of dollars internationally, in under ten minutes, for less than a dollar in fees. “What are the comparable options with the traditional system?” they ask.  “Krugman claims fiat transaction cost are low. In reality the fiat payment systems cost us 2% of GDP, which is quite a huge amount in absolute terms. It makes the economy less efficient, payment cost are friction losses in an economy and eat up profits and revenue. 2% is about two thirds of annual growth rate, so current transaction cost are a real problem. Bitcoin can reduce that by at least one order of magnitude.”  CIO and Managing Partner of BlockTower Capital, a cryptocurrency investment firm, Ari Paul, answered the question on Twitter, saying: You wrote an article about being skeptical of the value of Bitcoin without even addressing its core value propositions: censorship resistance and judgement resistance.

As of press time, bitcoin is trading around the USD 7,530 level on the same exchange.  Judging from technical analysis, the price is now close to the USD 7,350 - USD 7,450-area where it consolidated between July 18 and 22, which may provide crucial support for another leg up. The support area in the chart coincides with the 100-day moving average (blue line) - a widely followed trading indicator. Bitcoin prices have historically reacted in a strong way, both up and down, whenever this line is crossed. Also worth noting is that the popular Relative Strength Index (RSI) has now come down from “overbought” levels, as indicated by a reading above 70, to a “neutral” zone of about 50.

It was thought to be the first European online bank to do this. A year on, and Swissquote has revealed the fruits of its labor for adopting the cryptocurrency with a 44% surge in profits attributed to the “Crypto Boom” in the early half of 2018. According to Finews, the online bank’s massive growth in Q1 2018 was thanks to a “brisk demand” for crypto products and the eruption of the crypto markets earlier this year. >>CEO of Fatfish Internet: Crypto ETF Coming Soon, Despite Recent Rejections The profit was $26.01 million in the first half of 2018 representing a whopping 44% increase over the previous year. The bank sharply increased in trader activity and new customer accounts also.  But this is not the first time, the bank has seen its earnings soar because of Bitcoin. In January it was “swamped with interest” in Bitcoin trading as, according to Swissquote, “several thousand new account applications [were] being submitted every week.” >>IBM Blockchain Platform Targets Banks and Financial Institutions To be more precise, in the first half of 2018, the number of customer accounts in Swissquote’s commercial sector increased by 16,278. But not only an increase in accounts, the bank saw the average transaction amount grow to 11.8 transactions, which is a considerable jump when compared to the previous year’s one transaction over the same period. Since beginning its cryptocurrency adoption in 2017 with Bitcoin, Swissquote expanded its offering and by December 2017, it had added support for four other major cryptocurrencies; Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash. Last March, it introduced an exchange-traded product (ETP) that tracks a multi-cryptocurrency index. Swissquote’s crypto ETP is listed on the country’s largest stock exchange, the Six Swiss Exchange.

However, it's the smaller investors, those whose investments are below 100,000 USD, who know more about the most popular cryptocurrency and are the most intrigued by it. But this comes with a twist - despite they're intrigued, they won't be buying bitcoin soon.  The report, courtesy of Wells Fargo, an American bank, and Gallup, an American management consulting company, draws a correlation between these smaller investors and their age, saying younger males are more familiar with cryptocurrencies than seniors and women. The report also says that younger males are also those who can’t afford to invest much – this is a category with less than 100,000 USD in investments.  This second quarter report is entitled Wells Fargo/Gallup Investor and Retirement Optimism Index survey, and was conducted in May, among almost 2,000 U.S. adults with 10,000 USD or more invested in stocks, bonds or mutual funds, within or outside a retirement savings account. The report paints a picture of a digital asset that’s yet to make significant gains among investors of any kind. It says that just three percent of men and one percent of women own bitcoin. Three percent of those aged 18 to 49, and one percent of those aged 50 and above. Bitcoin is more present among the wealthier population, but even there it’s fairly slim: just three percent of those earning 90,000 USD or more have bitcoin. Among those with lower income, just one percent.  So, what’s holding bitcoin back? According to this report, the risk factor. Three in four investors (75%) consider bitcoin to be a ‘very risky’ investment, with another 23% saying it’s ‘somewhat risky’. Just two percent consider it ‘not too risky’, leaving none saying it’s not risky at all.

There were a couple of swing moves, but dips in BTC/USD were well bid around the USD 7,800 and USD 8,000 support levels. On the other hand, most major altcoins like ethereum, ripple, litecoin and bitcoin cash traded with a minor bearish angle and declined between 3% - 8%. Going forward, bitcoin may continue to trade in a range before buyers make an attempt to break the USD 8,250 resistance. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price struggled on many occasions to break the USD 8,250 and USD 8,300 resistance levels. BTC/USD declined, but it remained supported on the downside. It seems like the price is trading in a broad range of USD 7,800- USD 8,250 (UTC 08:30 AM). 
Therefore, it will either break the USD 8,250 resistance to accelerate higher or it could decline below the USD 7,800 support to extend the current correction wave. Ethereum
Ethereum price is down more than 3% and it broke the USD 465 and USD 450 support levels. ETH/USD is currently under pressure and it seems like it may perhaps decline further towards the USD 435 support.
On the upside, the previous support at USD 460 is now a key resistance for a recovery. Above this, the most important resistance is near USD 475. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price is also down more than 3% and is currently struggling to hold the USD 800 support. BCH/USD may continue to decline towards the USD 780 support, below which, the next major support awaits at USD 750. On the upside, the USD 830 and USD 840 levels are crucial hurdles for buyers.
Ripple price extended declines and broke an important support at USD 0.450. XRP/USD is now at a risk of more losses towards the USD 0.420 level in the near term. Resistances are at USD 0.450, USD 0.460 and USD 0.475. Other Altcoins Market Today

Or, you know, you could just shove a bitcoin into Kim Kardashian's hands and let her Instagram do the hard work.  That's basically what happened two days ago, during the First Annual City of Hope Charity Poker Tournament.

Crypto subreddits were flowing with creative juices, with one person commenting “This was the confirmation I was looking for that I’ve made a sound financial decision,” while others were more interested in seeing the results. “Kim Kardashian could be the catalyst to get this bull market going,” and “This is better than you think it is,” were some of the comments.  Kim may not build a super revolutionary blockchain-based product that’s going to turn the market on its head, but even by mentioning it on Instagram, she’s created plenty of buzz which is always good for the market.

Similarly, major altcoins like ethereum, ripple, EOS and bitcoin cash are trading above key supports and are likely to move higher in the coming sessions. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently trading (UTC 09:00 AM) in a tiny range near the USD 8,150 level with an immediate resistance at USD 8,250. Above this, BTC/USD must clear the USD 8,300 and USD 8,320 resistance levels to set the pace for a fresh upward move towards USD 8,500 or higher in the near term.
On the downside, the USD 8,050 support is a key hurdle for sellers, below which, the last swing at USD 7,800 is likely to hold losses in bitcoin. Ethereum
Ethereum price is trading in a contracting range below USD 475 resistance. ETH/USD is facing critical resistances near the USD 475 and USD 485 levels, above which, the price may rally above USD 515.
On the downside, there is a significant support near USD 450 - USD 455. Should there be a break below USD 450, the price may perhaps move back towards the USD 425 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price is forming a solid support near the USD 800 level. BCH/USD is slowly moving higher and is currently trading above the USD 820 level. A break above the USD 840 resistance will most likely clear the path for more upsides towards the USD 880 and USD 900 levels. Weekly supports are at USD 800, USD 750 and USD 720.

The veteran investor – who claims to have bought bitcoin at an average price of about USD 300 – added that “for each day that it doesn’t blow up or gets regulated out of existence, more money is gonna flow into the ecosystem.” Speaking of altcoins, Miller said that “there are 1,600 cryptocurrencies out there, and I would say most of them are probably worthless […] I think bitcoin has the greatest probability of being successful,” adding that he sees Ethereum as a close second runner in this race. The investor also said that the best way to think of bitcoin is as a “non-correlated asset most similar to gold…except that it’s much more easily transportable than gold […] and it can actually be used to buy things.” Miller further explained that if bitcoin were to become a third as valuable as gold, central banks would start looking at it as another asset to potentially hold in the same way they hold gold today, adding “that would open the market up extremely significantly.”

It hasn’t all been good, with the digital currency dropping below the $6,000 price mark at the end of June. But recently Bitcoin has redeemed itself, witnessing strong gains over the last week. So that brings up the question of whether there are catalysts driving Bitcoin higher. If not now, could there be catalysts at a later date? Spencer Bogart, the co-founder of Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm, seems to think so. There is a better atmosphere in the crypto industry right now. For the first time in a while, people are looking at the BTC price and feeling hopeful, reminiscent. Erik Voorhees is one of these people. Welcome back $8000 🙂 #bitcoin — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) July 24, 2018  But that doesn’t mean Bitcoin is where it should be, nor is it close to previous levels, like its high of $19,783.21, achieved in December of last year. Spencer Bogart, a former Bitcoin analyst, recognizes this, and yet, he told CNBC on Wednesday that he still expects “to see new highs.” But how? If people are edging away from Bitcoin and towards other cryptocurrencies, how will Bitcoin move higher than $9,000? $10,000? Well, according to Bogart, there are a few potential catalysts driving Bitcoin higher. 1. A Potential Bitcoin ETF A few days ago, Bitwise announced that it had filed with the SEC for an ETF that would track less than a dozen cryptocurrencies, with one being Bitcoin. Members of the company said that at the rate the market is moving, there’s a chance the SEC would “allow a crypto ETF onto the market.” (However, given recent light, this may still not be happening any time soon.) 2. Increasing Currency Rates 3. Mastercard’s New Patent Earlier this month, Mastercard announced a new patent regarding Bitcoin transactions. As a result, consumers may one day be charging their purchases (coffee, shopping, travel, you name it!) on their credit cards using Bitcoin (BTC). 4. Global Trade Tensions Overall, Bogart considers Bitcoin to be a “tinderbox” at the moment. In his interview with CNBC, Bogart concluded that the Bitcoin (BTC) price is “waiting for reasons to go higher.” Is he right, though? Both about the catalysts driving Bitcoin higher and that the currency is “waiting” to soar? At press time, Bitcoin is selling for $8,202.29, which puts BTC down 0.08% in the past twenty-four hours. >> Crypto Daily News: Crypto Market Falls and CME Altcoin Futures Put On Hold Featured image: annca via Pixabay",214.61000000000058,1

The Directional Movement Index (DMI) is a tool traders use to assess the direction and strength of price movements in financial assets, and it is currently showing the largest positive divergence since the explosive rally of December last year. The strong DMI reading indicates that the current rally is more significant than previous rallies we have seen this year, possibly leading to a reversal in the overall bearish trend for bitcoin. Meanwhile, hedge fund manager Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek Capital Management said in an interview with TheStreet.com that he expects another correction in bitcoin prices before the end of the year. However, he also maintained his own bullish USD 25,000 bitcoin price prediction for the end of 2018, and a whopping USD 500,000 for the end of 2024.

Bitcoin dipped below the USD 8,000-mark on Thursday evening following the news, in what can best be described as a healthy pullback following the strong surge in prices on Monday and Tuesday. Bitcoin price chart: On Thursday, the proposal filed through BATS BZX Exchange to list the “Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust” was voted down 3 to 1 by the SEC. The rejection marks the second time the Winklevoss twins have had a proposal for a bitcoin-backed ETF disapproved by the SEC. In response to the regulator’s concerns from earlier, the twins this time argued that bitcoin markets in general, including their own Gemini Exchange, are “uniquely resistant to manipulation.” The SEC listed in its decision “protection of investors and the public interest,” as well as insufficient “means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices” as key reasons for its conclusion. However, the commission also noted that the disapproval is not based on an evaluation of whether bitcoin “has utility or value” as an investment or not. In a statement, commissioner Hester M. Peirce, who voted against the decision to block the ETF, said: “More institutional participation would ameliorate many of the Commission’s concerns with the bitcoin market that underlie its disapproval order,” she said, adding that the ruling “sends a strong signal that innovation is unwelcome in our markets.” Despite this week’s disapproval, the ETF application with perhaps the best odds of receiving an approval is still under consideration by the SEC. That proposal, filed by financial firm VanEck through the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) – one of two futures exchanges where bitcoin is traded – is “nearly certain” to receive an approval, according to an anonymous former SEC employee. However, the recent bitcoin rally may turn out to do more harm than good for the prospects of getting an ETF approved by the SEC this year, another report suggested. An ETF would allow the average Joe to buy and sell bitcoin without having to go through an exchange – something that, as everyone hopes, would significantly improve adoption.",214.61000000000058,1

Conversely, there was a decent upward move in a few altcoins like ethereum, stellar, IOTA, EOS and XRP. Going forward, if bitcoin price resumes it uptrend, it would be interesting to see whether altcoins decline or continue to recover. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price corrected lower and moved below the USD 8,400 and USD 8,250 support levels. However, BTC/USD found a decent support near USD 8,100 and it is currently trading flat near the USD 8,250 level.

The expiry date on a futures contract is the day when the contract is settled. In the traditional commodities markets, for instance the market for sugar, this means that the trader holding the futures contract on this day better get ready to take physical delivery of 112,000 pounds of sugar – the standard contract size in this market. Some other futures markets, including bitcoin, instead settles the contract in cash on the expiry date, leaving the holder of that contract to do whatever he wants with the cash he receives.  In the past, the underlying markets for bitcoin have seen strong volatility and often some degree of selling following futures contracts expiry dates. This is a phenomenon known from both the stock market and foreign currencies, as large players in the market act to adjust their risk and holdings following the expiry. While generally a positive for the adoption of bitcoin as a mainstream investment asset, futures contracts have opened up the possibility for large investors to easily short bitcoin, meaning that they can profit from bitcoin moving lower in price. This has led some to claim that the futures market is negatively affecting bitcoin prices. Despite this, it is a reality that all markets consist of both bull and bears, and both sides are needed for the market to reflect true prices and be a place where buyers and sellers can meet and easily transact with each other. Bitcoin futures sees increased interest According to CME Group, interest in bitcoin futures trading is soaring, with trading volume up 93% in the second quarter of this year. Given the fact that mostly financial institutions and very big traders are active in the futures market, this points to a strong increase in institutional interest in bitcoin over the past few months.

Miners historically have held a significant portion of their earnings in bitcoin in anticipation of future appreciation. This time, however, some observers believe miners are preparing for yet another downturn in bitcoin prices.  While observers disagree about the reasons behind the selling, some point out that miners likely can’t afford not to sell, given the unprofitability many of them have seen in their business over the past few months. ”I’d expect that at these relatively low price levels, miners are selling off all of their new takings - they can’t afford not to,” Nic Carter, co-founder of Coinmetrics, an open source analytics provider in the crypto space, told Bloomberg. According to an estimate from Bloomberg, most bitcoin miners need prices of around USD 8,000 to break-even in their business. Bitcoin broke through that level on Tuesday, after having traded in unprofitable territory since May. Bitcoin price chart: ____

With the bitcoin market soaring again, some worry that the SEC will be hesitant to add fuel to the fire. “The SEC doesn’t want any part of adding to or influencing some speculative bubble,” said Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. He claims he’s now  “10 times more pessimistic” about a fund being approved.  In a letter from the SEC in January, valuation and volatility were cited as key concerns for the regulator regarding a bitcoin ETF. That letter, however, was written in the aftermath of the explosive growth that brought bitcoin to levels close to USD 20,000, a far cry from the situation in the market today. As reported by Cryptonews.com, in the letter, written by the SEC’s director Dalia Blass, the commission remained concerned over the funds which offer cryptocurrency related products rather than cryptocurrencies, where the risk of volatility would increase from the influence of underlying markets. A few other points mentioned in the letter:  The ETF application that bitcoin investors are most optimistic about was filed in June by New York-based VanEck through the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) – a company that certainly has a name for itself as being a heavyweight in the world of finance. However, Jake Chervinsky, a US-based lawyer at Kobre & Kim, a law firm, suggested that due to rulemaking procedures the SEC can, and probably will, delay its decision on the VanEck/SolidX commodity-backed bitcoin ETF until February 21, 2019. 0/ It kills me to tweet about SEC rulemaking procedures, but given the confusion on #crypto twitter today, it feels necessary.TL;DR -- the SEC can, and probably will, delay its decision on the VanEck/SolidX commodity-backed #bitcoin ETF until ~February 21, 2019.Thread. Bitcoin is currently up more than 40% since the lows in late June, partly driven by speculation that a bitcoin ETF would get approved in the US this year. An ETF is seen as an important step on the way to facilitate the mainstream adoption of bitcoin as an investment asset, much in the same way as futures contracts helped legitimize bitcoin as a trading asset last year.

Bitcoin’s bull run this week is leading many to predict a return of its 2017 bull run that pushed BTC to almost $20,000. July 16th seems to have started this run when BlackRock, the world’s largest exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider, announced that its company had assembled a group to look into cryptocurrencies, more specifically, Bitcoin (BTC). This news immediately boosted BTC into the green with 4% gains. BlackRock, to date, has managed nearly $6.4 trillion in assets. News of potential institutional investors dipping their toes into the market has given cryptocurrencies a boost in the past. With the world’s largest ETF provider eyeing cryptocurrencies, it seems investors have gained more confidence in crypto. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still mulling over whether it will approve a Bitcoin ETF, which was first filed through the Chicago Board of Exchange (CBOE). If approved, a Bitcoin ETF would mean individuals would be able to buy Bitcoin without having to go through crypto exchanges, many of which have been having serious security issues and have been hacked (which may lead some people to be wary of using them). The ICO Journal reported late last week that it is highly likely that a Bitcoin ETF will be approved. “I would call [the likelihood of approval] 90% at this point. The crypto markets have moderated and regulators have watched the lack of drama surrounding bitcoin futures across several global exchanges,” one of the ICO Journal’s unnamed sources, from the CFTC, reportedly said. “The price moderation and adoption of a peer product is what the conversations have centered around. In January we were justifiably concerned about a bubble and the harm a quickly approved product could attract speculators and create losses that led to significant lawsuits. Now, those factors seem to be mitigated significantly.” However, new reports have surfaced that the SEC will be pushing back their decision until September. The Bitcoin (BTC) bull run has extended over ten days and doesn’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon. For the week, Bitcoin is up 20%. The largest cryptocurrency has also boosted the rest of the market, as mostly all coins in the top 25 are sitting in the green currently. Bitcoin’s dominance of the entire cryptocurrency market has just hit 47%, which hasn’t been reached since BTC skyrocketed to its all-time high price back in December 2017. A year ago, Bitcoin held a very similar percentage hold on the market at 47.9%. At press time, BTC is trading at $8,179 a coin, up 6.07% in 24 hours.

For those of you who have been living under a rock lately, the date when the SEC gives its opinion on the proposed bitcoin ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is drawing closer.  An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, would allow the average Joe to buy and sell bitcoin without having to go through an exchange – something that, as everyone hopes, would significantly improve adoption.  The decision is estimated in the coming months, and it has prompted huge amounts of media attention and waves of internet memes. Google trends are showing that the general public's overall interest in the ETF has exploded, reaching highs it hasn't seen since late 2017. In the past, the SEC has turned down several ETF proposals. The cryptoverse hope that this time (a new proposal filed through the Chicago Board of Exchange (CBOE) by New York-based VanEck and blockchain platform SolidX) things might be different. The bitcoin ETF is ""nearly certain"" later this year, the ICO Journal reported, citing two undisclosed sources. One source is from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, while the second source is a former SEC employee who left the regulator two weeks ago. ""In January we were justifiably concerned about a bubble and the harm a quickly approved product could attract speculators and create losses that led to significant lawsuits. Now, those factors seem to be mitigated significantly,” according to the first source. While the second source expects a positive outcome in September, ""or if it gets strung out a little further it is simply a few ‘dotted i’s and crossed t’s’ are being finalized on larger regulatory language in the crypto space."" However, Bloomberg, for example, reports that we have bigger chances to land on Jupiter, than to see a bitcoin ETF launch in the US this year. According to the report, the SEC is tentative and slow, and it's just a matter of time before Canada steps in and scoops the pool. Bloomberg says the SEC asked the industry to withdraw original ETF requests, and sent out a letter to the fund industry, containing 31 questions about liquidity, valuation and security. It wants to have these answered before any new requests are filed.  ""Leveraged Bitcoin ETFs would almost certainly be the most volatile ETFs on the market and likely approved only after non-leveraged ones,"" it writes. ""Inverse ETFs would allow for the shorting of Bitcoin, without the risk of losing more than 100% of the investment."" At the same tame, the cryptoverse is growing restless.  This summer, the SEC asked the community for their comments about the Bitcoin ETF and it has received hundreds of replies.  A few examples below: Also, internet memes are mushrooming. While some are posting pictures of John F. Kennedy, clearly hinting at the moon, others are posting gifs of bitcoin killing altcoins, hinting at the recent price surge that does not seem to have affected the altcoins.

It seems like no expert agrees - some say it has bottomed, others say it hasn’t, while there’s always that group that says Bitcoin has no intrinsic value at all, so the point is moot. As reported, Barry Silbert, CEO of Digital Currency Group, a venture capital company focusing on the digital currency market, says the market has bottomed out when it comes to Bitcoin.  When asked what caused the bottom to come in now, Silbert replied by saying “I think the bears just kind of ran out of energy, ran out of Bitcoin to sell, and I think that from a technical perspective it’s starting to look pretty good,” adding that “when the Chair of the Fed [The Federal Reserve System, the central banking system of the USA] says negative things about Bitcoin […] and Bitcoin doesn’t move, I think that’s a really bullish sign.” Meanwhile, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and co-CEO of Bitmex, a cryptocurrency exchange, and the Bitcoin bull who predicted the cryptocurrency would reach USD 50,000 by year’s end just a few weeks ago, said Bitcoin hasn’t bottomed yet. “I don't actually think we've seen the worst [...] I would like to see us test 5,000 to really see if we put a bottom in,” he told CNBC.

(Watch Tom Lee, co-founder and head of Fundstrat Global Advisors, commenting on the recent bitcoin's breakout here.) However, the forecast game of whether or not Bitcoin has finally hit rock bottom is a dangerous one.

Their opinions on Bitcoin vary wildly, from contemptuous dismissal to bullishness akin to that of Tim Draper. This time, Ken Griffin, Marc Lasry and Howard Marks offer their view of the cryptocurrency. One of them even claims that he has invested 1% of his personal funds into Bitcoin. Ken Griffin, American investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist, is not a fan of Bitcoin, to say the least. He still scratches his head about it, he said at the Delivering Alpha Conference in New York on Wednesday, adding, according to CNBC, “I have a hard time finding myself wanting to be in the position of being a liquidity provider to a product that I don’t believe in.” He also said, “I don’t have a single portfolio manager [of mine] who has told me we should buy crypto, not a single portfolio manager.”  Interesting, because reports say that the investment banking giant Goldman Sachs, is looking to add cryptocurrency trading. At the same time, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, said on Monday that the world’s largest asset manager has put together a team to look at blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. However, Fink argues that he does not see massive investor demand. Howard Marks, another investor, spoke at the same conference. “It's not an investment [...] it's a trade,” he said. “In the long run, I think it will be shown not to have any substance.” People who buy Bitcoin, in his opinion, are only doing so because they hope someone will buy it from them at a higher price. When he was a kid, he said, they called it “the greater fool theory.”  This comment rings similar to what Bill Gates said about Bitcoin. Gates and his comments have been ridiculed in the space ever since. Meanwhile, Marc Lasry, hedge fund manager, disagrees with his colleagues. In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, he said that the price of Bitcoin could reach USD 40,000 as it goes more mainstream. As for why he prefers Bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies, he said, “The reason why I like Bitcoin is because it's the one everybody is going to come to.” Also, after buying his first bitcoin a few years ago he says that now he's invested around 1% of its personal funds in this cryptocurrency. However, when asked by the show host what the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is today, Lasry replied: ""I have no idea."" His comments hearken to those of Tim Draper, a famous early investor in groundbreaking projects such as the internet, Tesla, Skype and Hotmail among others. He famously said that Bitcoin will be “bigger than the internet, bigger than the Iron Age, the Renaissance” and that its price will reach USD 250,000 within four years. As to how he knows that, he joked that “spirits told me.” Who is going to be right is probably the question of the decade, as the world shifts to watch the young industry grow.

Bitcoin cash price corrected lower, but it is holding a key support at USD 800. BCH/USD must stay above the USD 780 - USD 800 support zone to move back higher. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the USD 830 level, followed by the USD 850 level.
Ripple price trimmed most of its gains and declined below the USD 0.50 support. It is a bearish sign, but if the XRP/USD pair manages to hold the USD 0.48 support, it could recover once again. Other Altcoins Market Today
There were sharp declines in a few altcoins like aion, LOOM, DROP, POWR, WAX, WAN and ETHOS. However, there are still many bullish signs on the charts, suggesting that dips remain supported. Bitcoin price could correct further lower, but there are many key supports on the downside such as USD 7,150, USD 7,080, USD 7,000, and USD 6,850.

The Monetary Policy Subcommittee hearing was titled “The Future of Money: Digital Currency,” and discussed, among other things, whether it would be a good idea for central banks to introduce their own digital currencies. Speaking at the hearing, Alex Pollock, senior fellow at the libertarian-leaning think-tank R Street Institute, said that “to have a central bank digital currency is one of the worst financial ideas of recent times, but still it’s quite conceivable.” He explained his view by saying that digital currencies issued by a central bank would only increase the size and power of the central bank over ordinary citizens. Further, Pollock added that “I don’t think the fundamental nature of money will change – it will surely be a monopoly issuance by a central bank,” adding that “it might be a private currency backed by reliable assets.” Pollock finally concluded his statement by saying “I don’t think it will be a private fiat currency like Bitcoin.” Meanwhile, the hearing in the House Committee on Agriculture stood out as more technical and detailed than previous hearings, with experts describing Blockchain technology as a new type of digital infrastructure, or a new type of foundational technology, in the same way as the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) email protocol was. Amber Baldet, CEO of blockchain startup Clovyr, said at the hearing that the technology is still in its early state, arguing that the US should take the lead with a more “proactive approach to regulation,” much in the same way as the US did with the Internet.

The coin made a whopping and sudden 10% gain yesterday and it is still heading skyward. Currently, it is sitting pretty at $7,457. This week’s gains are surprising to some considering Bitcoins recent moves; it seemed everything was steadily going southward. Avenue Capital Group CEO, Marc Lasry, has always regretted not buying Bitcoin when it was $300. The billionaire spoke of his regret back in December and has spoken out favorably for the coin again today with a bullish prediction that it will hit the $40k mark this year.  In an interview with CNBC’s “Squawk Box”, the billionaire also added: “As it gets more into the mainstream, and as more markets end up allowing it to trade where it’s freely tradable, to me that’s more of the bet.” If this week’s gains are to continue he may be right.",55.460000000000036,1

Let’s check in on the Bitcoin price. Last week, Bitcoin had an unimpressive week on the market, but it seems to have turned itself around as BTC has seen over a 15% increase in just seven days. This doesn’t compare to the percentage gains the cryptocurrency was seeing towards the end of last year, but it’s a positive step. This morning, Bitcoin gained over $10 billion in total market cap in just under an hour. The push by the world’s first cryptocurrency has caused the market to rise right along with it, and two altcoins, Cardano (#8) and Stellar (#6), are currently seeing percentage gains above 25%. At press time, BTC is trading at $7,442.51 a coin, up 10.66% in 24 hours. Bitcoin hasn’t seen this price point in over a month. The world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum (ETH), is also seeing percentage gains. At press time, ETH is trading just under $500 at $496.75 a coin, up 5.53% in 24 hours. For months, the main news circulating around cryptocurrency has been about hacks, regulations, and celebrity skeptics. The news has caused many investors to lose confidence in the cryptocurrency space and is the reason why the market has been on a decline since early May. What might have turned it all around the past couple of days was the BlackRock announcement. BlackRock is the world’s largest exchange-traded fund and the company’s CEO announced that BlackRock was forming its own group to look into cryptocurrencies. This announcement hit the masses on Monday morning and caused Bitcoin (BTC) to spike nearly 6% instantaneously. Yesterday, Bitcoin spiked 10% in less than an hour, and it was speculated that Goldman Sach’s CEO was to thank. News broke that his company is preparing to launch a ‘proper’ crypto trading platform. This morning, Mastercard announced that it is filing another blockchain patent—which most likely aided the spike in Bitcoin further this morning. How high will Bitcoin go? We shall see!

BTC/USD surged and broke a couple of important resistances such as USD 6,850 and USD 7,000. It registered more than 10% gains and traded close to USD 7,550, with no obvious news spurring the price rise. Altcoins also followed bitcoin’s path and rallied sharply. Large cap coins like ADA, BCH, EOS, TRX, and XLM were among the top performers. The recent upward drift in bitcoin is a great sign and indicates that the market is back in the green zone. Fundamentally, there were many possible reasons for the current trend, including Coinbase’s move into the broker-dealer space.  A few other possible factors were - BlackRock exploring the crypto space, CFA Institute, a global association of investment professionals, adding cryptocurrencies and blockchain topics to its Level I and II curriculums, and fresh inflows of funds sparked buying interest in bitcoin and altcoins. Possibly, even Charlie Lee’s (Litecoin creator) tweet to own at least 1 Bitcoin before buying any altcoins sparked some buying interest.
(Watch Tom Lee, co-founder and head of Fundstrat Global Advisors, commenting on bitcoin's breakout here.) Meanwhile, market analysts say new money coming into the market could have created a short squeeze, forcing traders who bet against bitcoin to buy the digital currency to cover their losses. “Investors would be wise to remain cautious, as we saw a similar situation in April where some big short positions were squeezed causing the price to surge. That said, if bitcoin pushes past USD 8,000, it’ll indicate that the bull is back and prices could continue to climb further,” Matthew Newton, market analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, said. Technically, bitcoin price formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern recently, and broke the neckline resistance at USD 6,850 to start a significant upward move. At present (UTC 08:00 AM), BTC/USD is facing a tough resistance near the 100-day simple moving average at USD 7,600 level. A break above this is required for an upward acceleration towards the USD 8,000 resistance. If the price corrects lower from the current levels, an initial support awaits at USD 7,200. Below this, the previous resistances at USD 7,000 and USD 6,850 are likely to act as strong supports. Ethereum
Ethereum price finally broke the USD 500 resistance and traded towards the USD 415 level. ETH/USD is currently correcting lower towards the USD 490 and USD 480 support levels.
On the upside, a break above the USD 515 level could open the doors for a push towards the USD 525 level in the near term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price surged more than 7% and broke the USD 820 and USD 850 resistance levels. BCH/USD traded close to the USD 900 level and is currently down to USD 855. An immediate support is at USD 850, followed by USD 840.
Ripple price extended gains above an important resistance at USD 0.50. XRP/USD even broke the USD 0.52 resistance before retreating to USD 0.51. On the downside, the previous resistance at USD 0.50 may perhaps act as a support. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many altcoins rallied today, including ardor, ELF, STRAT, XLM, ADA, EOS and DOGE. Out of these, ardor and ELF were the best performers surging 40% and 20% respectively.

The gain followed a boost in bitcoin trading volume across popular exchanges. (Watch Tom Lee, co-founder and head of Fundstrat Global Advisors, commenting on bitcoin's breakout here.) Lee reacted:  _____ However, because of his original tweet, Lee faced a backlash from proponents of his own cryptocurrency, with some accusing him of talking down Litecoin and asking if he is abandoning the coin he created. Lee, however, dismissed all concerns. I'm spending my full time on Litecoin. What do you do for Litecoin? Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million coins, while 4 million coins are reportedly lost forever. Litecoin’s supply is capped at 84 million coins. It currently ranks as the 6th most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap.com.  While it is true that Bitcoin has outperformed Litecoin since the beginning of this year, both coins tend to follow each other closely.

Ethereum performed well and it seems like ETH/USD may perhaps trade towards USD 500 in the near term. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price started a major upward move this week and gained traction above the USD 6,500 pivot level. BTC/USD climbed more than 5% and traded towards the USD 6,750 level. The price is currently trading in a range with an immediate support at USD 6,680.
Below the USD 6,680 support, the price may well test the USD 6,600 support. On the upside, a break above the USD 6,750 high is likely to push the price towards the USD 6,850 resistance. Above this last, the price may possibly test the USD 7,000 level. Ethereum
Ethereum price followed bitcoin’s price action and surged above the USD 450 and USD 460 resistance levels. ETH/USD even broke the USD 475 resistance and tested the USD 480 level.

Larry Fink told Reuters that he does not see “massive investor demand” currently, but his company will continue to look into cryptocurrency regardless. Fink didn’t have much to add to his statement, but any news regarding BlackRock potentially making moves into the cryptocurrency space is good news. As of June 30th, the company has managed nearly $6.4 trillion in assets. A spokesperson from BlackRock sent an email to CNBC about the latest company news and said: “We have been looking at blockchain technology for several years, recognizing potential for shared processes and data across market participants, clearing, settlement and reconciliation and simplified securities issuance.” This working group was established back in 2015, but it seems that the group may be eyeing cryptocurrencies more closely now. The cryptocurrency market jumped up this morning as news spread about the ETF provider’s interest in crypto. News like this gives investors confidence, but will it last? Lately, there has been nothing but news about cryptocurrency regulations around the world, which has driven the market down to its year-low of just over $235 billion on June 29th. While this BlackRock news isn’t really new news at all, it does show that the company is serious about its explorations. The CEO’s comments this morning may have been to boost his company’s image, as Blackrock’s main competitor, Fidelity, has been exploring blockchain extensively for quite some time. At press time, the total cryptocurrency market is trading just below $266 billion. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $6,606.76 a coin, up 3.86%, in 24 hours.

However, Fink argues that he does not see massive investor demand. In an interview with Reuters, Fink said that the company is still exploring all options: “We are a big student of blockchain.” Meanwhile, in a separate interview, the CEO told Bloomberg ""I don’t believe any client has sought out crypto exposure"". Also, when asked if he feels the need to be prepared for the day when clients might want exposure, Fink said, ""at the moment, no."" In either case, markets reacted positively - Bitcoin’s price, which is up by 4% in the past 24 hours as of the time of writing, sitting at USD 6,630.96.  Reuters stressed that “any move to invest in cryptocurrencies or to use blockchain by BlackRock would mark a pivot for the company and a major institutional endorsement for the insurgent technology,” as the company managed USD 6.3 trillion in assets as of June 30. Fink has previously called Bitcoin “speculative,” claiming that it thrives because of its anonymity - or, more precisely, pseudonymity. During that particular interview with Reuters last November, he also noted Bitcoin’s association with money laundering. However, in February, Richard Turnill, Global Chief Investment Strategist for BlackRock, wrote in a report that cryptocurrencies has the potential to become more widely used in the future as the markets mature. As it often happens, Bitcoin’s rise in price has boosted up other cryptocurrencies as well: the top 10 coins by market cap are in the green, with single-digit increases in percentage.

Many explanations have surfaced in these years, yet perhaps none as compelling and different than the one that visualizes Bitcoin transactions as bus passengers. TxStreet.com is a website that translates real-time transaction data from the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash networks into cartoons of passengers looking something like South Park characters boarding a series of buses, complete with sound effects of running engines. It partly showcases the differences between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash - perhaps most obvious from the number of passengers, where Bitcoin vastly outnumbers Bitcoin Cash due to popularity.  Each of the characters waiting or boarding the buses is a payment moving from one account to another, and their size directly corresponds to the amount of money being sent. Walking speed reflects whether or not the sender has paid a system fee to speed the confirmation. Each bus is a block of transactions that departs whenever a block of transactions is confirmed by a network and added to the blockchain. The Bitcoin Cash bus station has 32 buses waiting, representing the 32 megabytes of transaction data that each Bitcoin Cash block has available. Bitcoin, meanwhile, only has two, representing two megabytes - but one is SegWit, a solution implemented to “squeeze” more passengers onto the bus as a solution to Bitcoin’s scalability issues. The building next to the Bitcoin bus station is Lightning House, representing the Lightning Network. The creator of the website, whose Twitter handle is @revofever, explained to Fortune:  The website was inspired in part by TxHighway.com, a similar visualizer explicitly aimed at promoting Bitcoin Cash. TxStreet’s creator, whose Twitter handle is @revofever, told Fortune that promotion was not the goal when creating the website, saying “I was motivated to show each blockchain as accurately and fairly as possible.

BTC/USD even broke the USD 6,250 support, but losses were contained well above the USD 6,000 level. Later, the price started trading in a tight range before starting an upward move. The current price action indicates that bitcoin opened the week with bullish signs and if it breaks the USD 6,500 resistance, there could be more gains. Altcoins like ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash also followed a positive path with a couple of breaks above key resistances.  Bitcoin
Bitcoin price made a nice upward move after trading towards USD 6,080. BTC/USD broke the USD 6,250 resistance and is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) trading in a positive zone. However, a major weekly resistance is near USD 6,500. 
A successful break above the USD 6,500 resistance may perhaps set the pace for a larger bullish move during the coming days. If the price fails to move above USD 6,500, there could be a fresh bearish reaction. Weekly supports are at USD 6,250 and USD 6,080. Ethereum
Ethereum registered solid gains during the past three sessions and trimmed most of its last week losses. More importantly, ETH/USD recently broke the USD 450 resistance, opening the doors for more gains.

Bitcoin cash price was successful in moving above the USD 700 resistance. BCH/USD is currently up more than 2.5% and it seems like it may well test the USD 740 resistance. Above the stated resistance, the price will most likely surge towards the next hurdles at USD 780 - USD 800.

Bitcoin price formed a new weekly low near the USD 6,070 level and recovered sharply. BTC/USD jumped back above the USD 6,180 and USD 6,200 resistances to trim most of its losses. 
However, bitcoin buyers are facing many challenges near the USD 6,300 level. It they fail to break the stated resistance, the price could drop again back below USD 6,200. A few key supports on the downside are at USD 6,150, USD 6,070 and USD 6,020. Ethereum
Ethereum price also followed bitcoin and declined to a new weekly low below USD 420. However, ETH/USD found a strong support above USD 415, resulting in a decent comeback.
The price is currently trading above the USD 430 level (UTC 06:00 AM), with an immediate resistance near USD 442. Above this, the price must clear the USD 450 resistance to move into a bullish zone. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price recovered sharply and it is currently fighting to settle above the USD 700 resistance. Should there be an hourly close above USD 700, BCH/USD may well gain traction to move above the USD 720 resistance. On the flip side, a failure might reverse gains and the price could drop back to USD 660.

TenX’s co-founder Julian Hosp is definitely bullish about market leader BTC with his prediction for the second half of 2018. At the RISE tech conference in Hong Kong the crypto wallet and card start-up founder said to CNBC: “I predicted for 2018, we’re going to see $5,000 and $60,000. So $5,000, we pretty much hit it, so let’s see if we can do the $60,000. I’m still quite confident.” It’s an interesting range-covering prediction. And while the coin has come “close” to $5,000 this year, it hasn’t actually hit it. The lowest we’ve seen this year is June’s $5,700. The way the market has been faring of late though, bears seem to be holding down the fort and it wouldn’t be a surprising turn of events if BTC did hit the $5K mark.  The appropriate question is ‘When? rather than ‘If’.  On the other end of the scale, reaching $60K (which is triple the amount of Bitcoin’s all-time-high of $20K) would take some major event to push the coin price up there. Hosp does recognize this. He is a believer, but not blindly bullish, stating that it would take a “massive positive event” to send Bitcoin to the moon.",-167.96999999999935,0

He compared bitcoin to ethereum and smaller tokens built on the Ethereum platform by explaining that technologies such as smart contracts and decentralized apps “are very difficult [to use] and aren’t coming any time soon.” “The use case for bitcoin is valid today, which is the currency of the Internet,” he said, adding that “it’s digital gold and it’s a cross-border money transfer which people use.” While discussing bitcoin’s relative resilience as other tokens have sold off heavily, Smith, dubbed “Wall Street’s crypto king” by the show host, also mentioned two important price levels to keep an eye on in the bitcoin market; USD 5,800 and USD 6,800.  (USD 6.362 at press time, according to coinmarketcap.com.) Bitcoin price chart: Smith explained that we are now back at the same price level as “before bitcoin became a financial instrument,” referring to the time before the futures market for bitcoin was launched late last year. “The price seems to be bouncing around [the two price levels], it kind of gets to USD 6,800 and then runs out of steam, and eventually it’s going to break out of that range,” adding that “I think that will be the indicator of new money coming in.” However, China’s Center for Information Industry Development, an organization affiliated with the Chinese central government, wouldn't agree with Smith. In its recent ranking of 30 cryptocurrencies bitcoin now is only 17th.

However, BTC/USD failed to hold the stated support and declined sharply. It dragged all major altcoins lower like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, EOS and litecoin. The market moved into a bearish zone and there is a risk of further declines if sellers remain in action. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price broke a few key supports during the recent decline, including USD 6,500 and USD 6,400. BTC/USD tested the next important support at USD 6,250 and it is currently trading in a range. 
If the price resumes its slide and breaks the USD 6,250 support, there could be a sharp downward move towards USD 6,000. On the flip side, if the price recovers from the current levels, the broken supports at USD 6,400 and USD 6,500 are likely to act as hurdles for further gains. Ethereum
Ethereum price was under a lot of bearish pressure as it dropped by more than 5% and cleared a crucial support at USD 450. ETH/USD traded towards the USD 425 level and is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) consolidating losses near USD 430.
If there is a downside break below USD 425, the price may perhaps test the USD 405 low. On the upside, resistances are sitting near USD 440, USD 450 and USD 455. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price settled below the USD 700 support, which is a bearish sign. BCH/USD may continue to move down towards the next support at USD 650. If there is an upward correction, the pair could face hurdles near USD 700 and USD 720.
Ripple price extended its decline in the bearish zone and broke the USD 0.45 support. It stayed above the USD 0.43 level, but there is a risk of another bearish reaction towards the USD 0.42 support in the near term. Other Altcoins Market Today
Most altcoins faced an increased selling pressure and moved further into the red zone, including gas, stellar, cardano, IOTA, TRON, NEO, XMR and DASH. Two altcoins KCS and POWR gained traction today and moved up by 12% and 8% respectively.

Bitcoin declined sharply and broke the USD 6,600 support. However, buyers were able to hold declines below USD 6,500 - USD 6,540. Similarly, Ethereum nosedived and broke the USD 470 and USD 460 supports to test the USD 450 pivot level. The market is clearly under a lot of bearish pressure, but if prices stay above these important supports, there could be a recovery in coming sessions. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price struggled to hold gains above the USD 6,700 support and declined around 2% to test the USD 6,500 support zone. BTC/USD stayed above the stated support and is currently consolidating losses near USD 6,600 (UTC 8:00 AM). It must move back above USD 6,700 to recover and retest USD 6,850.
On the flip side, if the price extends its decline and breaks the USD 6,500 support, it will most likely move back in a bearish zone. The next supports are at USD 6,400 and USD 6,250. Ethereum
Ethereum price dropped more than 5% and cleared the USD 470 and USD 460 supports. However, ETH/USD stayed above the USD 450 support, which is a positive sign.
Having said that, there is still a risk of more losses if sellers succeed in pushing the price below USD 450. On the upside, the USD 470 level is a key resistance for a decent recovery towards USD 485 in the near term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price slowly moved down and almost tested the USD 700 handle. BCH/USD is currently consolidating near USD 720 with an immediate resistance at USD 740. Above this, the price may perhaps revisit the USD 780 resistance.
Ripple price is back in a bearish zone and is currently trading above the USD 0.45 support. Should there be a downside break below USD 0.45, XRP/USD may well decline back towards the USD 0.42 support. Other Altcoins Market Today

Despite proclamations from supporters about its revolutionary technology and the “freedom” it offers its users, many are still not convinced. If you’re Bitcoin, it must not bode well for you to have a major critic in the form of Nobel-winning economist and Columbia Professor Joseph Stiglitz. Today, Stiglitz spoke with Financial News of his concern about the adoption of the unregulated financial asset which he believes elicits illegal behaviors as it has no central authority and its users can be totally anonymous. He has spoken to Bloomberg on several occasions before about his distaste for Bitcoin. The economist’s concerns center around the potential for criminal enterprises to take complete advantage of the network: “You cannot have a means of payment that is based on secrecy when you’re trying to create a transparent banking system…If you open up a hole like Bitcoin, then all the nefarious activity will go through that hole, and no government can allow that.” Despite his concerns, he believes that once the market is truly big enough, regulators will enforce rules which would render the coin useless. Currently, the cryptocurrency market is still considered small with a $273 billion market cap, though predictions have placed it nearer to $1 Trillion by the end of 2018. It Stiglitz opinion, the popularity of Bitcoin lies only with criminals and if “you regulate it so you couldn’t engage in money laundering and all these other [crimes], there will be no demand for Bitcoin. By regulating the abuses, you are going to regulate it out of existence. It exists because of the abuses.” Though not a Bitcoin enthusiast, Stiglitz isn’t swearing off cryptocurrency completely. He believes the US could benefit from a more open and transparent digital payment system in order to protect from the corruption that is experienced in our current financial system.  “I believe very strongly that countries like the United States could and should move to a digital currency … so that you would have the ability to trace this kind of corruption.” But what digital currency would be his preference? >>Facebook Appoints Director of Engineering Blockchain.

BTC/USD gained traction and even traded to a new monthly high above USD 6,800. It indicates that buyers were successful in overcoming selling pressure and pushed the price in a bullish zone. Altcoins like ethereum and bitcoin cash also traded higher and are consolidating gains. In the short term, there could be a downward correction, but the market could extend gains this week if bitcoin stays above USD 6,500. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price staged a solid uptrend above the USD 6,400 pivot level. BTC/USD climbed higher and broke the USD 6,750 and USD 6,800 resistance levels. It traded to a new monthly high near USD 6,820 before starting a short-term correction.
On the downside, supports are seen at USD 6,700 and USD 6,650. Below USD 6,600, the price could test an important support at USD 6,500. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 6,800, followed by the recent high near USD 6,820. Above this, the price may perhaps trade above USD 6,850. Ethereum
Ethereum broke a crucial resistance near USD 485 and traded towards the USD 500 barrier. However, ETH/USD failed to test the USD 500 level and is currently consolidating gains (GMT 9:00 AM).

Bitcoin cash price settled above the USD 740 resistance. However, BCH/USD is facing a lot of hurdles near the USD 780 and USD 800 levels. A push above the USD 800 barrier is needed for buyers to gain control. Supports on the downside are at USD 740, USD 720 and USD 700.

While cryptocurrency is not a physical commodity, it is still very much influenced by weather which reportedly managed to bring down the global Bitcoin hashrate, or computing power of the Bitcoin network, showing exactly how important Chinese miners are to the whole industry. Sichuan, a province in southwest China, has recently been hit by heavy floods, rendering thousands homeless and destroying thousands of hectares of crops. The Bitcoin mining farms of the region did not escape unharmed: although owners tried to salvage what they could, photos of abandoned mining rigs are circulating on media. Max Kortrakul, founder and chief executive of social trading platform Carboneum, told Financial Times, “the pictures of the flooding in Sichuan are alarming and give the impression that the Bitcoin hashrate must surely have taken a hit.”  This is not unimaginable, as Chinese miners make up about 50% to 70% of the world’s Bitcoin production. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that the Sichuan floods could affect up to 8%-10% percent of global Bitcoin mining activity. Aaron McDonald, co-founder and chief executive of Centrality, a marketplace of applications, says the hashrate dip is due to the floods, the European heatwave, as well as the dip in price, FT reported. Leo Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association in Hong Kong, says that the suggestion of a 30% drop in the hashrate is the result of the flooding comes down to guesswork. Some analysts even believe that the hashrate dip has got nothing to do with the Sichuan flooding, regardless of the size of the mining community.

On Thursday, he told CNBC that ""Bitcoin has historically traded at 2.5 times its mining costs. It's not out of the question that it could be over USD 20,000 by the end of the year at fair value."" Later he clarified his position, saying he ""may have misspoke a little bit"":   ""What I was trying to illustrate was that given where mining costs will be and applying the historical average of 2.5 times mining costs, that would imply fair value over USD 20,000, roughly USD 22,000.” Afterwards, he stressed that bitcoin still can reach USD 25,000 by the end of the year. Still, he maintains that worrying about a few thousand dollars in the current circumstances, as any return even approaching USD 20,000 would be around 200% percent higher than where Bitcoin is right now, which is USD 6,543.67 at the time of writing, according to data from coinmarketcap.com. Lee has previously several times determined that the price of Bitcoin should be at least double the cost of mining. He has earlier predicted that by the end of 2019, a single Bitcoin could be worth anywhere between USD 20,000 and USD 64,000, with an average of USD 36,000.

But a month later, now in the second half of the year, Tom Lee has changed his mind. He now expects that Bitcoin will trade a little over $20,000 by year-end. As the Bitcoin bulls and bears continue to fight, the Fundstrat co-founder has sided with both in certain instances. He admitted that Bitcoin’s trading volume has dropped. He cut his Bitcoin price target. Yet Mr. Lee made it evident Thursday that this is not something investors should fret over. On Thursday, in an interview with CNBC, Lee said that he had cut his price target and expects to see Bitcoin at $22,000 per unit by the end of 2018. That’s 20% less than his previous $25K year-end projection. According to Tom Lee, this is OK. He said any return nearing his $20K forecast for the coin by the end of the year would be an increase of roughly 200%. In May, Bitcoin reached its most recent high, which was around the $9,800 price mark. Since then, BTC has lost roughly 30%. Despite this, Tom Lee believes that Bitcoin, as well as blockchain technology, are only in the “early stages” of their transformation. He even called them a “multidecade story.” Tom Lee appears to be undeterred. However, the new Tom Lee Bitcoin price target may have shocked a few people. Why? Because Lee has stuck by his $25K prediction through thick and thin – even when the Bitcoin price dropped during the 2018 Consensus conference.

He was speaking at the 2018 Asia Blockchain Summit in Taiwan. The same sentiment has also been echoed by other industry experts, with Ryan Rabaglia of Octagon Strategy, a digital asset brokerage, recently telling CNBC that if regulations are sorted out, more and more professional and institutional players will enter the market and likely drive up prices as a result. Bitcoin charts: Secondly, Lee pointed to the futures market for bitcoin as possibly having a detrimental effect on the ‘real’ market. While Lee did not offer any reasons for why this could be the case, it is well-known that the futures market is largely controlled by banks and very large traders.  As Cryptonews.com has reported on previously, this is not the first time Lee blames the futures market for bitcoin’s misery. However, as bitcoin futures contracts are settled in cash and no physical delivery of bitcoins takes place, no direct link exists between bitcoin futures contracts and real bitcoin.  In May, the San Francisco Federal Reserve also stressed that  bitcoin’s fall from almost USD 20,000 is directly tied to the launch of a futures market.  “The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence. It is consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the introduction of futures markets for an asset,” four researchers wrote in the bank's Economic Letter in May. Bitcoin price forecast revised lower While speaking at the summit, Lee also revised his year-end price prediction for bitcoin from USD 25,000 to USD 22,000. He further explained that he believes the price of bitcoin should be at least twice the cost of mining, under normal market conditions.  UPDATED: Later, Tom Lee explained this prediction in more detail, saying that Bitcoin still can hit USD 25,000 this year.  Today, mining bitcoin is not profitable for most people, and Lee estimates the current mining cost to be around USD 9,100 per bitcoin.  Also in May, Fundstrat estimated that by the end of 2019, average price of Bitcoin could reach USD 36,000, with a USD 20,000 - USD 64,000 range. This explosion in price could happen due to crypto mining, as Fundstrat predicts a growth of 350% in hash power (the processing power of the Bitcoin network) through 2019.  Lee previously predicted a bitcoin price surge following the Consensus 2018 conference in May, which failed to materialize.",46.68000000000029,1

Naturally, very few people are willing to type the address in by hand, instead relying on copying it from one application to another - and this is exactly where the danger lies. This type of malware is called CryptoCurrency Clipboard Hijackers monitors, as its name implies, the Windows clipboard, which is the temporary memory where the copied data goes until it is replaced by another copied thing. If this malware detects a cryptocurrency address in the clipboard - where it will inevitably be if you copy-paste it - it swaps that address out for its own. This means that the coins will go to that address when it is pasted, unless you double check it (and that is something you should certainly do). According to BleepingComputer, a sample of this type of malware monitors over 2.3 million cryptocurrency addresses. It can be very hard to protect yourself from this type of malware as it shows no indication of running in the background. This is why you should always have an up to date antivirus installed and running, make periodical scans of your system, and double check the address you’re sending your coins to. As Cryptonews.com previously reported, cybersecurity expert Lotem Finkelsteen of the Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point Software Technologies warns that cryptocurrency-related attacks will surpass all others this year.

Bitcoin price formed a solid support above USD 6,300 and jumped above the USD 6,500 and USD 6,600 resistance levels. BTC/USD is currently (GMT 08:30 AM) trading in a tiny range below the USD 6,800 resistance, and is preparing for the next move. 
An upside break above USD 6,800 could ignite more gains towards the USD 7,000 and USD 7,200 levels. On the flip side, if the price corrects lower, the previous resistances at USD 6,600 and USD 6,500 are likely to act as supports for buyers. Ethereum
Ethereum price gained traction and moved above a crucial resistance at USD 450. ETH/USD traded above the USD 480 level and is currently consolidating gains.
An initial support on the downside is at USD 472, below which the price may test the USD 460 support. On the upside, a break above the USD 485 level could give an opening to buyers to take the price above the USD 500 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price surged higher and cleared many hurdles such as USD 750, USD 780 and USD 800. BCH/USD is currently trading with a stable bias above the USD 800 level, with an immediate resistance at USD 820 and USD 850. 
Ripple price zoomed higher and cleared the USD 0.48 and USD 0.50 resistances. XRP/USD is now trading in a bullish zone above USD 0.50. On the upside, resistances are seen near the USD 0.520 and USD 0.535 levels. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins posted heavy gains today, including WAX, Bytecoin, Ethos, MONA, ELF, LOOM, ELA, SYS, Golem, KCS, CMT, MITH and BTS. A few other coins such as Neo, ADA, Ark and NEM posted gains between 15-20%. Overall, the market sentiment was really boosted during the past three sessions. Going forward, a break above USD 7,000 in bitcoin could further accelerate gains in BTC and altcoins in the near term.",-67.06999999999971,0

The researcher named Li Honghan made the statement during a summit held in Beijing on June 29 known as the New Financial Trends and Fin-Tech Summit 2018, according to Chinese news portal Chinatimes.net.cn. While Li did not reveal his data source, it is well-known that Chinese investors are still active in the cryptocurrency space, making use of advanced censorship-resistant technologies like decentralized exchanges and peer-to-peer marketplaces to bypass government regulation. As Cryptonews.com has reported on previously, bitcoin mining has also proved difficult for regulators to crack down on in China. It is estimated that more than 50% of global bitcoin mining capacity is located in China, with the remote provinces of Qinghai and Sichuan having a particularly high concentration of bitcoin miners. The large number of miners in China has previously led Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse to attack bitcoin by claiming that it is “controlled by China.” Bitcoin has seen a surge in price and trading volume over the past few days, adding nearly 14% since June 29, according to data from Coinbase.",-67.06999999999971,0

The site where this was published details the “first excerpt to a literary work consisting of two parts” that claims to be “a short story if you will, with some of the most brought up questions and answers. I wanted the people and the facts to be known.” The website that the excerpt appeared on is called NakamotoFamilyFoundation.org and was anonymously purchased three days ago via Amazon’s domain registrar. Of course, the self-proclaimed Satoshi (or, as the community calls him, Faketoshi) Craig Wright immediately tweeted that the “new” Nakamoto writings were a fraud: “Nakamotofamilyfoundation cannot get the dates nor technical details correct.” In true Nakamoto style, it even includes a cryptogram, which purports to reveal names related to the title of the book. The answer seems to be honne and tatamae (or tatemae), which is a Japanese expression that describes “the contrast between a person’s true feelings and desires” and “the behavior and opinions one displays in public.” The excerpt is titled “duality” in a similar manner. The excerpt also indicates that Satoshi Nakamoto may have been, at some point at least, a group of people. “The truth is one that people will not come to expect,” Nakamoto says in the excerpt, continuing, “Because the truth is too special to give away, requires a long answer, which will be in the book.”  Strange parts of the text include one that seems to imply that there was more than one genesis block of Bitcoin, the starting point for the blockchain, as the author refers to it as the “first” genesis block. Is it real? Nobody knows for sure right now. People mentioned in the excerpt have been contacted by WIRED, and some either refuse to comment or say that nothing is verifiable proof. What remains, however, is the hope that we will find out soon enough, and maybe the mystery of the past decade will be solved. ______ A few passages from the excerpt:",233.80000000000018,1

However, the price faced heavy selling interest due to regulation and exchange hack issues. As a result, a fresh round of bearish wave was initiated and BTC/USD tumbled by more than USD 10,000. In February 2018, the price formed a low around USD 6,000 and later corrected above USD 10,000. The upside move was capped by USD 12,000 and the price resumed its downtrend. During the past few months, the price traded with a bearish bias below the USD 10,000 resistance level. On the positive, there was no substantial decline below the USD 6,000 support area. Recently, the price traded towards the USD 5,650 level, but jumped back above USD 6,000. Overall, it seems like the USD 5,500 - USD 6,000 zone is a crucial support. As long as the price is above the stated support zone, it could make an attempt to recover during the coming months. A few significant resistances on the way to USD 10,000 are at USD 6,500, USD 7,500, USD 8,000 and USD 9,200. Finally, a convincing break above USD 10,000 may perhaps start a solid upward wave towards USD 12,000 and USD 15,000. On the flip side, if bitcoin fails to stay above the USD 5,500 - USD 6,000 support zone, then there could be a lot of pressure on buyers. The next supports are at USD 5,000 and USD 4,200. Meanwhile, last week, Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, an insurance giant, told CNBC that bitcoin would be a buy if the price falls below USD 5,000. El-Erian sees bitcoin emerging as more of a tradeable commodity than a currency, but doesn't expect it will get all the way back to USD 20,000. Ethereum Price Outlook Ethereum followed bitcoin and fell from well above USD 1,350 in January 2018 to USD 370 in April 2018. Later, ETH/USD corrected above USD 500 and tested the USD 800 level where it faced a crucial resistance. It declined once again and is currently trading well below the USD 500 pivot level. However, the USD 400 support zone is holding declines in Ethereum and it may perhaps continue to act as a strong support. To start a decent recovery, ETH/USD must settle above the USD 500 pivot level. Above this, the next hurdles for buyers are at USD 650 and 800. The final barrier for a larger upward wave is at USD 1,000. On the other hand, a break below the USD 400 support could push the price toward the 2018 low near USD 370. Below this last, there is an open space up to USD 250. Bitcoin Cash, Ripple and Other Altcoins Market Bitcoin cash and ripple were under heavy selling pressure during the first half of 2018. BCH/USD declined from well above USD 2,500 to USD 650 which acted as a strong support. It is currently consolidating losses and is preparing for the next move. Resistances are at USD 800, USD 1,000 and USD 1,250.  Ripple peaked around USD 3.70 in January 2018 and declined more than USD 3.00. It traded close to the USD 0.40 level and is currently in a bearish zone. Resistances are seen near USD 0.65, 0.75, 0.80 and 1.00. Above this last, XRP/USD could recover towards the USD 1.50 level. To sum up, bitcoin and altcoins declined heavily during the first half of 2018. Prices are now stable and are following a consolidation pattern. Going forward, a successful break above key resistances in bitcoin could stage a decent comeback in the coming months. Key levels to watch out are USD 6,500, USD 7,500, USD 8,000 and USD 9,200 on the upside, and USD 6,000, USD 5,500 and USD 5,000 on the downside.",233.80000000000018,1

The new bitcoin ETF proposal was brought up by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) as it seeks to list a fund known as “SolidX Bitcoin Shares,” issued by VanEck, an investment management firm, according to an official SEC statement. The new fund intends to be fully backed by holding real bitcoin, as opposed to holding only bitcoin derivatives or futures contracts, as some other funds do. This could mean that a new flow of money from more traditionally minded investors and institutions can now find its way into the bitcoin market, potentially setting the stage for a new price rally. In the past, the SEC has turned down several such proposals, arguing that they have no way of ensuring a sufficient level of transparency regarding trading activity and potential price manipulation in the underlying market for bitcoin.  The SEC has also argued that they would want to have a market for bitcoin futures contracts before approving an ETF. With both the CBOE and CME Group now offering this, it is speculated that it is only a matter of time before the SEC approves the first ETF backed by bitcoin that is trading on regulated US exchanges. The approval of a publicly-traded Bitcoin ETFs would be a big deal for Bitcoin as an asset class, as ETFs are traded on exchanges in the same way as stocks. Traditional ETFs, which is a security which tracks indices, a commodity or a basket of assets, have gained substantial popularity among both institutional and retail investors as they are generally liquid and easy to buy and sell.",233.80000000000018,1

He believes that the current Bitcoin downtrend can only be reversed if the coin creates a short-term break, through the $6,300 mark. The Bitcoin analyst studied the Bitcoin 15-day moving average charts from May and said: “It really is a no-man’s land from a trading standpoint. I think if you’re a very short-term trader… we have a critical stop level at the $5,800-6000… with a resistance level of $6,300-6400. If it can rally through that, I think there’s a chance Bitcoin could start to turn.” A 15-day moving average chart is a good indicator of market trends and can help forecast whether market trend is positive or negative. Slyumer looked back over Bitcoin’s 15-day moving average charts going back to 2017. These charts indicated that the crypto markets have shown progressively higher lows. A “very critical support” for the coin came at the $7,000 level this year and Slyumer focused on this point as a turning point. Because Bitcoin lost this support level and equally failed to cross the $7,800 resistance threshold on the upside, it created “lower highs” and began an overall downtrend. Bitcoin is currently defending the $6,000 level and is trading below its 15-day MA trendline for late 2017, early 2018. In Slyumer’s opinion, $5,800-$6,000 is now the “absolutely critical” support level for Bitcoin. If it fails to hold then the coin will decline further to the $5,000-$5,500 range. Until we see the coin holding above this support level then the downtrend is inevitably going to continue. >>Can a Bitcoin Airdrop Help the Humanitarian Crisis in Venezuela? Tom Lee’s prediction that Bitcoin will reach $25,000 this year will be a tough rally for the coin in Slyumer’s opinion: “At this point, we’re just seeing recovery rallies back to the 15-day, back to the downtrend, and it’s failing.”  Other major investors have also made similar predictions for Bitcoin price – notably billionaire Tim Draper who thinks the coin might reach $250,000 by 2022.  For now, though, Bitcoin is currently trading just under $6,100. The coin is down 9 percent from the beginning of the week. Featured Image: DepositPhotos.com/ANDRANIK2017",-249.72000000000025,0

The country is considered one of the world’s most oppressive monetary states. Unfair practices implemented by its government to maintain control of its people has resulted in the following; “severe shortages of medicines, medical supplies, and food have intensified since 2014, and weak government responses have undermined Venezuelans’ rights to health and food. Protesters have been arbitrarily detained and subject to abuse by security forces.” — as reported by The Human Rights Watch World Report in 2017. But can cryptocurrency change all this? Developer John Wheeler is trying to make that the case. The former bank employee turned developer is working on a new project — getting Bitcoin into the hands of Venezuelan citizens. Teaming with Morgan Crena, the pair have formed a non-profit organization called the Pale Blue Foundation which is currently working to create a Bitcoin Airdrop. Through his foundation, Wheeler wants to use Bitcoin to change an economic and political crisis so severe that people can’t pay for necessities — food is in such short supply that joining lengthy food lines have become regular practice for citizens just trying to obtain the necessities. Prices for such necessities can also be exorbitant and routinely changed by the seller. There is no regulation. Wheeler and Crena’s mission involves a supporting team who are developing a mobile app called Azul. This app will hopefully draw millions of donations which will be transferred via a Bitcoin Airdrop to citizens of Venezuela. The project began as an idea batted around on Medium, but it is starting to take real shape; now, it is drawing help from Bitcoin companies including OpenBazaar and LocalBitcoins. But why Bitcoin? Crypto communities Zcash and Dash have also been long trying to help Venezuela in some way, but the team has focused on Bitcoin because they believe it to be the most widely available and resilient network with the ability to handle vast transactions. “We’re focused on bitcoin because we think it’s the most viable solution with the most worldwide potential,” Wheeler said. Bitcoin’s upcoming lightning network is also a key consideration for the technical design of the Azul App. Lightning is a layer-two technology which will solve scaling issues within the Bitcoin network, increasing transaction limits exponentially. The Pale Blue Foundation is currently in discussions with relative developers — lightning wallet developers CoinClip and the lightning startup ACINQ. With all the technicalities behind the mission on a roll and with the necessary bodies joining the fight, the team still needs to secure the funding that’ll buy the Bitcoin to be airdropped to Venezuelans. The initial hope is to secure millions of dollars from venture capitalists and donors; believers of the cause who want to join a “large-scale collaborative mission to help people suffering from financial tyranny.” >>Bank of England Warns Executives of Crypto Risk.

Bitcoin dominance rate reached a high of 2 months yesterday, to 42.74%, and stands at 42.50% as of the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap data. The Dominance Index is an indicator that tracks the percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization contributed by the leading cryptocurrency. So, a rising dominance rate might mean the demand for Bitcoin is greater than the demand for other innovations. Percentage of total market capitalization (dominance): For example, last year, Bitcoin’s dominance rate increased from 38% to 66.5% in six months, driving its value up from USD 1,760 to nearly USD 20,000. But it must be noted that it also tends to rise during risk aversion periods, when investors move out of high-risk alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin, and then possibly on to fiat currency. Possibly, it would seem that risk aversion is to blame for this dominance rate rising this time, given how much the prices have fallen. A lot of investors seem to prefer cash over any of the cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin included. However, if prices start to rise along with Bitcoin’s dominance rate, it may mean that the cryptocurrencies markets have bottomed out. But the rising of the Bitcoin dominance rate also means that we still have time until the Flippening. It is a possible future event when Ethereum overtakes Bitcoin to become the most valuable cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization.

The spokesperson did not offer any further comments as to why the company chose to remove the option. Members of the crypto community immediately took to Reddit to voice their frustration, with some suggesting switching over to more crypto-friendly booking sites such as CheapAir, which has accepted bitcoin since 2013. Some also noted that many employees in the IT and blockchain industry receive their salaries in bitcoin, and that Expedia now risks losing business from this customer segment. “[…] Customer support said they stopped accepting it June 10… A lot of us in the tech industry get a portion of our salary in Bitcoin and it was really good to use Expedia for flights. I won’t be using them anymore,” a Reddit user wrote. Expedia first started accepting payments in bitcoin back in 2014 as part of a partnership with the Coinbase exchange. With the sudden suspension of the service, some now speculate that Expedia acted in response to Coinbase suspending its custodial service for businesses. Without a reliable custodial solution, merchants working with Coinbase may find difficulties in continuing to process payments in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

A four-university team, led by professor Feng Mai of Stevens School of Business, found that not only do comments influence the price, but some commenters can even carry up to ten times the weight of others. Professor Feng Mai was working with University of Cincinnati, Dickinson College and Ivey Business School, collecting two years’ worth of posts from the Bitcointalk forum, as well as two months’ worth of data from Twitter.  “Any changes in Bitcoin's price are obviously going to affect the sentiment around it, so we needed to factor in those influences as well,” Mai was quoted as saying on the website of Stevens School of Business. The results of this research were recently published in the Journal of Management Information Systems, and show that “periods of increasingly positive social media commentary do in fact influence the rising price of Bitcoin significantly.” But the voice of those who do not regularly talk about Bitcoin, instead taking the time to comment infrequently, is what is actually moving the price. On the other hand, users who are very active did not move Bitcoin's price much at all. “This was a big finding, and it does seem to prove that people are trusting the silent majority much more, perhaps because they do not seem to have an agenda,” Mai said for the Stevens article, adding, “It's also true that, by following the infrequent posters' comments, you get a much more accurate prediction of Bitcoin's price over time, and this is useful for investors and potential investors to know.” The team hopes to investigate blockchain technology and its relationship with social media soon as well. Meanwhile, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has already urged customers to avoid buying tokens based on tips shared on social media.

Bitcoin price is currently trading near the USD 6,050 (GMT 08:45 AM) level with an immediate support at USD 6,000. Should there be a downside break below USD 6,000, there could be heavy declines during the following sessions. The next supports are USD 5,800 and USD 5,750.
Alternatively, if bitcoin buyers take a stand and push the price above USD 6,250, there are chances of an extended recovery towards the USD 6,400 level. Ethereum
Ethereum price struggled to move above the USD 450 resistance and is currently down more than 4%. An initial support is near the USD 430 level, below which, there is a risk of further losses towards the USD 420 level.

Bitcoin cash tumbled and failed to stay above the USD 720 and USD 700 support levels. It is currently down around 6% with an immediate support at USD 680. Below this, BCH/USD may perhaps decline back towards the USD 650 support area. Resistance are seen at USD 720 and USD 740.

Bitcoin price is currently (GMT 08:40 AM) trading flat near the USD 6,200 level with an immediate resistance at USD 6,250. However, the most important resistance awaits near USD 6,300. Above this last, BTC/USD will most likely stage further recoveries above USD 6,500.
On the flip side, if the price fails to move above USD 6,300, there could be a retest of USD 6,000. Any further declines could push the price back in a downtrend. Ethereum
Ethereum price tested the USD 465 - USD 470 resistance zone and faced a strong selling interest. ETH/USD moved down and is currently trading above the USD 450 support.

Bitcoin cash price recovered above the USD 750 level and tested the USD 780 resistance. BCH/USD failed to move above USD 780 and declined back towards USD 740. An immediate support is at USD 725, followed by the all-important USD 700.
Ripple price also tested a crucial resistance near USD 0.50, which was a support earlier. XRP/USD failed to gain traction above USD 0.50 and is currently trading above the USD 0.4750 support. Supports on the downside are at USD 0.46 and USD 0.45. Other Altcoins Market Today

A year ago, crypto hedge funds were being formed left and right, and he believes that now, many of these funds are “hitting their one-year lock up.” This could mean people are looking to sell and get out of the space before the prices fall even lower, which would artificially bring them down anyway. And now, the good news. Andreessen Horowitz has announced that the fund is designed to include the best features of traditional venture capital, updated to the modern crypto world. Named a16z crypto, the venture fund will invest in crypto companies and protocols and will be able to hold investments for 10+ years and in all conditions, regardless of coin prices, according to Chris Dixon, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz.  ""We are long-term, patient investors. We’ve been investing in crypto assets for 5+ years. We’ve never sold any of those investments, and don’t plan to any time soon,"" he added.  The fund, co-led by a new general partner at the venture firm Katie Haun, is focused on non-speculative use case, where the value of crypto tokens is driven by the underlying, practical uses cases. ""Although the Bitcoin whitepaper is now almost 10 years old, we believe we are still early in the crypto movement. The infrastructure needs to be improved and the applications are difficult for non-early adopters to use. Many crypto applications still get dismissed as toys. We believe this will change quickly. For one, crypto is purely a software movement and doesn’t depend on a hardware buildout, in contrast to, say, the internet, which required laying cables and building cell towers. Second, the space is developing extremely rapidly, partly because the code, data, and knowledge is largely open source, and partly because of the increasing inflow of talent,"" Dixon continues.  Meanwhile, the survey by ING might support his vision. Surveying nearly 15,000 people across 13 countries the bank said that fewer than one in 10 Europeans currently own cryptocurrency, but that 16% of respondents expect to own it in the future. Most surprisingly, 15% of them said they would be open to receiving their salary in cryptocurrency. More than a third of participants believe cryptocurrency is the future of spending online. ""Cryptocurrency remains an abstract investment for many, but there may be more appetite for digital currencies than some might suggest,"" said Jessica Exton, a behavioural scientist at ING, Independent reported. If cryptocurrency stabilises there may be increased interest, she added.",-159.8800000000001,0

New Tether tokens being issued means more money is making its way into the cryptocurrency market, which could help set the stage for a price comeback in a market that has seen heavy selling over the past two months. The 250 million new tokens released on Monday marks the first significant issuance of Tether tokens since May 18, when the company also released 250 million tokens. Back then, bitcoin rose by about USD 400 in the days that followed before it sold off heavily again a few days later. If history repeats itself, we therefore may see another bitcoin rally following this most recent issuance. Bitcoin price chart: Tether has received its share of criticism from members of the cryptocurrency community over a lack of transparency in the way it issues new Tether tokens. While the company says each token in circulation is backed by USD 1 in their bank account, they have failed to provide conclusive evidence to back up their claim. Earlier in June, Tether announced that they had passed a solvency test by law firm Freeh Sporkin & Sullivan LLP. Although the test didn’t meet the criteria of a formal audit, the law firm stated that it was “confident that Tether’s unencumbered assets exceed the balance of fully-backed USD Tethers in circulation as of June 1st, 2018.” As of press time, bitcoin traded nearly unchanged for the day, well above the USD 6,000 mark. Shortly after the release of the new tokens, Litecoin creator Charlie Lee shared his optimistic view on Twitter: Generally, this has been a precursor of price going up. Tether gets printed when people deposit USD and get USDT back. This USDT will then be used to buy crypto. This is similar to someone depositing $250MM to exchanges. Of course, that doesn't mean they will buy right away. DYOR https://t.co/zg2PEjGohv",-159.8800000000001,0

Don’t worry, it’s overall placement is still number one by market cap, but China released a new listing of its top blockchains and Bitcoin didn’t fare so well. Spoiler alert – Bitcoin didn’t even make the top ten. The China Electronic Information Industry Development (CCID) body initially released its blockchain rankings list in May. On the original list, Bitcoin (BTC) hadn’t made it into the top ten either, but it was close, coming in at lucky number 13 (the original list gave a three-way tie between Bitcoin, Verge [XVG], and Waves). Unfortunately for Bitcoin, when the CCID updated its blockchain rankings, the Bitcoin ranking was pushed back even farther. In China, Bitcoin is now ranked as the 17th best blockchain, hardly a gold star rating. (Verge moved down as well – to number 20 – but Waves actually moved up to number 11.) A lot of different factors need to be considered when attempting to rank blockchains, making the process no easy feat. Blockchain networks can be vastly different, with different elements and different goals that need to be considered, so it can be a bit tricky to compare blockchains. Certain blockchains are so different from one another that it would be silly to compare them. Among the most important things to consider when judging a blockchain network include its smart contracts, token, security, scalability, and more. Really, it’s a lot of stuff to mishmash together to come up with a ranking, and when thinking in terms other than market cap, blockchain rankings will no doubt vary considerably depending on who’s doing the ranking and what factors they are judging. China’s ranking took into consideration technology, application, and innovation, which is a pretty fair breakdown, but there’s still no information on how exactly the CCID judged the blockchains. Bitcoin was given a 41.6 for technology, 14.9 for applicability, and 35 for innovation. Its overall index from the CCID was 91.5.

The figure, who is Jack Ma, spoke specifically of Bitcoin (BTC) — and his thoughts weren’t exactly in favor of the cryptocurrency. On Monday, Jack Ma, a Chinese billionaire and the founder of Alibaba Group Holding, spoke at an event held by Ant Financial Services Group, a financial affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding. During his presentation, Jack Ma spoke of both cryptocurrency and blockchain. While he praised the latter, he had a few things to say about cryptocurrencies – specifically Bitcoin. According to Mr. Jack Ma, a Bitcoin bubble looms over us. This is not the first time the Alibaba Group Holding founder has expressed these thoughts. In the past, he has warned investors over the volatile crypto sector. The comments of a Bitcoin bubble come one day after BTC set a 2018 low. Right now, Bitcoin is selling for $6,317. This puts the coin up 6.46% in the past twenty-four hours. On the whole, Jack Ma didn’t call Bitcoin a bad thing. He provided the crowd at the Ant Financial event with reasons as to why Bitcoin has potential, but also why it is failing. As for the negatives, Jack Ma said Bitcoin itself is driven by speculation. For these reasons, the billionaire vowed to avoid the asset class. However, Jack Ma did have a few optimistic things to say on the topic of Bitcoin. The virtual currency itself may be sketchy at times, but according to the e-commerce giant, the blockchain technology behind BTC should be used to solve real-world problems. Blockchain – to Jack Ma and many others –  is the real winner. So is it fair to say that Jack Ma is team blockchain? I would say so. The comments of blockchain’s revolutionary potential come on the same day that Ant Financial (Ma’s affiliate) launched money transfers between Hong Kong and the Philippines. These transfers were entirely blockchain-based. Do you agree with Jack Ma? Is the Bitcoin bubble real?  Moreover, how do you feel about the newly launched blockchain-based money transfers? Is blockchain really the solution to real-life problems?

This service, designed to compete with banks and traditional remittance services, is currently available only for transfers between Hong Kong and the Philippines, according to Ant Financial.  The billionaire said he wants to make it possible for people to remit even 1 cent at almost no cost, compared with the high fees charged by traditional remittances services like MoneyGram, which Ant tried to buy last year. “Due to reasons from the US our deal with MoneyGram did not succeed, so I said, ‘Let’s make one better [than MoneyGram]’ that uses the most advanced technology,” Ma said at the launch in Hong Kong, adding that the impact of blockchain on people and society will be “greater than we can ever imagine,” according to the report in the South China Morning Post, which is owned by Alibaba. “Bitcoin, however, could be a bubble,” he added, Bloomberg reports. “Blockchain should not be a tech to get rich overnight […] There are still 1.7 billion people in the world who have no bank accounts, but most of them have mobile phones.”  This is not the first time Ma expressed his skepticism towards the cryptocurrency. “Blockchain is not a bubble, but Bitcoin is,” is his opinion, as he shared it multiple times. “It’s just not for me,” remains his opinion, first said in December 2017. Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba’s backed by some of the biggest names in global finance and investment, has explored blockchain technology for years.  Now, users of AlipayHK - the Hong Kong version of Ant’s Alipay wallet - should be able to transfer money within seconds to users of GCash. The first three months are a trial period during which transaction fees will be waived. The disadvantages of traditional remittance outlets include long waiting times, lack of transparency, high transaction costs, and unfavourable exchange rates.  This is among the problems for Filipinos working overseas, for whom sending money to their families’ GCash mobile wallets will “soon be the norm,” says Anthony Thomas, president of Mynt, the operator of GCash. Eric Jing, chief executive of Ant Financial, said in a statement, “This is a new starting point and significant step forward in accelerating Alipay’s pace to promote tech for good and financial inclusion globally.” A banking giant Standard Chartered will act as the settlement bank for both AlipayHK and GCash for the blockchain transactions Hong Kong financial technology company TNG Wallet already provides mobile remittances via digital wallets, but it does not use blockchain.",77.21000000000004,1

BTC/USD traded towards the USD 5,600 level, found support, and later started an upward correction. The price is back above the USD 6,000 level, but buyers are facing many challenges to the topside. Similarly, major altcoins like ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash are showing signs of a recovery, but are facing crucial resistances. Going forward, there could be more recoveries in bitcoin, ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash if they succeed in surpassing the USD 6,500, USD 485, USD 0.50, and USD 800 resistances respectively. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently up more than 5% to USD 6,140 (GMT 08:45 AM). BTC/USD may continue to grind higher if it manages to break the USD 6,250 barrier, which is a crucial pivot zone. Above this, the next major hurdle for more upsides is at USD 6,500.
On the other hand, if bitcoin fails to move above USD 6,250, there could be another bearish reaction. An initial support is at USD 6,000, followed by USD 6,850. Below this last, the price may perhaps trade to a new low below USD 5,600. Ethereum
Ethereum tumbled further and it almost tested the USD 400 handle. ETH/USD traded near USD 420 before recovering back above USD 440. The pair is currently facing resistances near USD 450 and USD 460.
However, the most important hurdle for buyers is at USD 485, above which, the price may stage a decent correction above the USD 500 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price struggled a lot this past week and settled below USD 800. It even broke the USD 700 support before buyers appeared. Weekly resistances are at USD 780, USD 800 and USD 850. Supports are seen near USD 720, USD 700 and USD 650.
Ripple settled below a crucial support at USD 0.50. It is currently correcting higher, but is facing resistances at USD 0.48 and USD 0.49 before USD 0.50. XRP/USD must move back above USD 0.50 to recover further. Other Altcoins Market Today

Announced on Friday by their trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi, the exchange has just today been awarded permission for this act by the Tokyo District Court, whereas the petition was filed in November 2017. ""Accordingly, enormous assets, which were to be distributed to Mt. Gox’s shareholders under the bankruptcy proceedings, will be returned to creditors of Mt.Gox in civil rehabilitation proceedings. This is the creditors’ victory,"" a group of claimants who had established Mt. Gox Creditors lobby group reacted to the announcement.  They add that ""However, this victory has not been realized yet. The victory will come to creditors when Mt. Gox makes payment to creditors and creditors actually receive such payment."" According to various estimations, as the process moves forward, those who lost funds in what become one of the world’s most famous hacks in history could expect to see their money sometime in the next year.  Also, according to Kobayashi, claims seeking a refund of Bitcoins will not be converted into monetary claims, meaning, that creditors who were affected and wanted to be repaid in Bitcoin may receive larger amounts of cash than those who opted for a payback in fiat. Moreover, it is estimated that Mt. Gox's bitcoin holdings will not need to be sold. Earlier this year, Kobayashi was accused of bringing down the price of the cryptocurrency in February.  However, answering to the question ""Are there future plans to sell Bitcoins and Bitcoin cash?"", Kobayashi explained that ""at present, nothing has been determined.""   Kobayashi will report on the exchange’s assets at a creditors’ meeting on September 26th in Tokyo. After that, all claimants will have until October 22nd to submit their claims.

Similarly, ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash declined heavily and moved into a bearish zone.  Overall, it seems like buyers struggled to hold gains in bitcoin and altcoins, suggesting more weakness in the near term.

Going forward, if bitcoin price fails to recover and drops below USD 6,200, it could decline to new 2018 lows.  Bitcoin
Bitcoin price faced an increased selling interest after it failed to surpass a major resistance at USD 6,800. BTC/USD declined and tested the USD 6,500 support zone, down more than 3.5%.

Ethereum price dropped by more than 7% and broke the USD 515 and USD 500 support levels. On the downside, the next supports are at USD 490 and USD 485. Below this last, ETH/USD may perhaps trade towards USD 460. 
On the upside, there are many resistances, starting with USD 520 up to USD 540. Any further gains depend on the market sentiment in the near term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price declined heavily and broke the USD 860 and USD 850 support levels. BCH/USD is down more than 8% and is testing the USD 800 handle (GMT 8:30 AM). A break below this may perhaps call for a test of the USD 750 support level.
Ripple price just managed to stay above the USD 0.50 support. However, XRP/USD is at a risk of more declines if buyers fail to keep the price above USD 0.50. Other Altcoins Market Today

The official press release states that these new parameters are in response to an Order-in-Council recently adopted by the government that restricts the amount of electricity sold to blockchain companies. The new regime seeks to allocate up to 500 megawatts, in addition to 120 megawatts of already existing initiatives. Reportedly, the starting rate would be CAD 0.01 (USD 0.0075) per kilowatt hour - 20% more than the industry standard price. Now it’s up to local energy regulator Regie de l’energie to approve the plan. Hydro-Quebec commented on the proposal, “The goal of this process is to both maximize economic spinoffs for Quebec and revenue for Hydro-Quebec - in turn, pushing electricity rates down for customers.” Hydro-Quebec had already temporarily suspended new requests from crypto miners after demand skyrocketed to the point where its short- and medium-term capacity to provide power to the region has been affected. Even back then, an official statement said they would ask the regulator to set aside electricity specifically for crypto miners, and also wants to propose a set rate for mining and blockchain technology-related industries. Canada, and Quebec in particular, had seen crypto migrations since the beginning of this year due to China’s suppression of cryptocurrency mining. Miners had decided to move to the next relatively cheapest region, and Hydro Quebec welcomed the surge of interest but had been unsure of its ability to supply ample energy for the growing sector.",-654.1900000000005,0

From those hailing the nascent industry as a game changer for the world as we know it, to those equating it to the infamous tulip bubble, everybody has an opinion. Brian Armstrong, CEO and co-founder of Coinbase, US-based cryptocurrency exchange, thinks people are needlessly worried about the current dip: “It can be scary the first time you see it, but to us who have been in the industry for many years, it feels like old news,” he said in a motivational message to his team.   “When there is hype, people are irrationally exuberant. When there is despair, people are irrationally pessimistic. Neither is true,” he continues, adding that the truth is in the middle, and that value correlates to transactions per day and not price. 1/ Shared the following message with the team @coinbase today... pic.twitter.com/XDNDZfCtOp ""I want to encourage you all to ignore the price of crypto and the headlines which will inevitably start to come up. Our job is to rise above that, finding our own intrinsic source of motivation, to come in and do our best work, regardless of what other people think,"" Armstrong said in an attempt to motivate his team. Total cryptocurrency market capitalization: Meanwhile, Chris Concannon, the president of Cboe Global Markets, owner of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, could be successful in demotivating crypto investors. He thinks they should be laying awake at night, fretting over the market movements, especially in relation to ICOs (initial coin offerings) and regulations. Should the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decide ICO tokens are unregistered securities, they would be rendered useless, he told in an interview with Business Insider. Concannon forecasts that, first, the SEC will go after ICO market participants, then, class-action lawsuits against the teams behind ICO projects will surge. ""If you sold someone an unregistered security you are liable to them if they decide to take them to court,"" Concannon said. Who is right - and whether anyone truly is - is anyone’s guess. Armstrong considers the current slump in the market a good way to clear out weak participants. “It gets rid of the people who are in it for the wrong reasons, and it gives us an opportunity to keep making progress while everyone else gets distracted,” he said. Meanwhile, Robert Hockett, a professor of financial regulation at Cornell University, told Business Insider that the cryptoverse is moving out of the ""Wild West"" phase into a ""regulatory scrutiny"" phase. In the short term we'll see the rise of funds to launch class-actions and increased litigation, but in the long term, we'll see a cleansing of the market, according to Hockett.

The loss incurred by Pantera compares with Bitcoins drop of about 15% over the same period. According to a report by Bloomberg, the Digital Asset Fund is currently down by 51% for the year.

In the letter, the California-based fund also took aim at Warren Buffet for his negative view on crypto, pointing out that his company, Berkshire Hathaway, avoided the Internet boom in the early 2000s, and therefore missed great investment opportunities in companies like Facebook, Google, and Netflix. “If Berkshire buys Bitcoin as quickly as Apple — it will be in 2045.

Bitcoin price climbed above the USD 6,750 level recently before correcting to USD 6,700. BTC/USD is trading higher by more than 3% with bullish moves. On the upside, the price is facing a crucial resistance just below USD 6,800.
Therefore, a successful push above the USD 6,800 hurdle is needed for an upside acceleration. The next resistances are USD 6,880 and USD 7,000. Supports on the downside are at USD 6,600 and USD 6,550. Ethereum
Ethereum price followed bitcoin and jumped above a major resistance at USD 500. It opened the doors for more gains and ETH/USD traded a few points above the USD 520 level.
At the outset, the price is trading nicely above the USD 500 - USD 510 zone. To the topside, a break above USD 530 could accelerate gains in the near term towards USD 560. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price attempted a close above the USD 900 barrier. It failed, but the current market sentiment for BCH/USD is positive with gains more than 5%. The pair may perhaps break the USD 900 resistance soon to stage a decent upward move towards USD 940 and USD 950.

The report also mentions that bitcoin mines in western China’s Qinghai Province are often owned and operated by a group of young people referred to as ‘fuerdai,’ a term used to describe the rich children of the new Chinese elite. With both provinces being considered relatively poor compared to the more developed coastal regions in China, bitcoin mining is seen as viable way to create jobs and generate revenues for the local government, according to the report. Additionally, Sichuan and Qinghai Province both enjoy cheap and often heavily subsidized electricity, making it an ideal location for large-scale bitcoin mining. Nikkei Asian Review further speculates that the reason why Chinese authorities have condoned the activity is due to a desire to better control the flow of money internationally, in an effort to counter the global influence the US exercises through the US dollar. It is estimated that China still controls more than 50% of global bitcoin mining capacity, a fact that just this last week prompted Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse to accuse the digital currency of being “controlled by China.”",27.549999999999272,1

In the interview, Nunn said that even as the bears have dominated the bitcoin market as of late, volatility will ultimately work in favor of the bulls, and added: “I absolutely stand by my prediction.” “What you've got to remember is that the sharpest comparison to crypto in recent years is the dotcom-era, but actually crypto is a whole industry in reverse because the initial investment into it is from the crowd,” he explained. Nunn also told the newspaper that since virtually all the money in the crypto space is from the general public, prices of cryptocurrencies tend to follow investor sentiment rather than normal market fundamentals. “[…] A flood of bad news can wobble the market, stuff like regulation. The industry is so small that there's market manipulation,” Nunn added. Meanwhile, Tom Lee, Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, still thinks that bitcoin could hit USD 25,000 despite the recent drop. Lee believes that once institutional investors jump into the market, there could be solid gains in bitcoin. Following the strong sell-off last week, bitcoin prices have consolidated over the weekend and appears to have found support around USD 6,400 as of press time.",224.75,1

Earlier this month, it was reported that Bitcoin’s (BTC) energy footprint had nearly doubled in six months and was expected to grow. According to the study, Bitcoin could be using up approximately 0.5% of the world’s energy by the end of the year, almost the same amount used by the Netherlands. Needless to say, most people might not want that to happen. On Thursday, the Missoula County Commission decided to delay its decision over the suspension of Bitcoin mining to August 2018, according to the local news site the Missoulian. The hearing lasted nearly two hours where presentations and comments from the public were made on the topic of Bitcoin mining operations. Missoula County Commissioner Jean Curtiss had said at the end of the hearing that “we all understand that we don’t understand,” while County Commissioner Cola Rowley noted that this could be a good time for “education and outreach.” The county fears that the energy consumed by these operations could “pose a reliability and safety risk to local electric distribution systems, and affect electric rates for other customers” and that “the high energy loads could pose a fire hazard, and create electronic waste.” If approved, the decision would impose a one-year ban on Bitcoin mining and any new or expanding cryptocurrency activity. >>Did Tether (USDT) Really Manipulate the All-Time Price Highs of Bitcoin (BTC)? Other regions that have suspended Bitcoin mining projects include the Canadian province of Québec, who announced in March that it’s utility services provider Hydro-Québec will not be taking in any more applications for the development of mining operations. The demand for energy was beginning to exceed that supply that Hydro-Québec could supply.

The current price action is positive, but buyers need to gather momentum to avoid a bearish reaction. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price recovered above a major resistance at USD 6,500, pushing the market sentiment into a short-term bullish zone. BTC/USD traded close to the USD 6,700 level where sellers took a stand. The price is currently (GMT 6:00 AM) up more than 1% and is trading in a positive zone.
However, buyers need to push the price above the USD 6,700 level to gain upside momentum. On the downside, supports are seen near the USD 6,500 and USD 6,400. If the price stays above the USD 6,400 support, it could continue to move higher. Ethereum
Ethereum price traded above the USD 520 level with positive signs. It is currently up more than 4% and is trading nicely above the USD 500 level. On the upside, should there be a bullish break above the USD 520 level, there could be an upside acceleration above the USD 540 level.
On the downside, a key support is at USD 500. Below this, the price may perhaps move back in a bearish zone towards the USD 480 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price failed to break the USD 900 resistance level once again. BCH/USD is currently trading above the USD 850 level with ranging moves. The price may soon make the next move either above USD 900 or below USD 850 in the near term.
Ripple price traded a few points above the USD 0.5500 resistance, which is a positive zone. The next barrier for XRP/USD is around the USD 0.5700 level where sellers are likely to appear. Other Altcoins Market Today
The market sentiment improved recently and pushed small cap altcoins in a bullish zone. Today, a few coins such as MOAC, BTCP, KCS and MITH gained momentum and climbed between 10-18%.

In a report released on Thursday, Lee blames the sell-off on “significant volatility” around futures expiry dates on the CBOE and CME futures marketplaces. He further cites a theory by Justin Saslaw, cryptoasset investor at Raptor Capital Management, that says bitcoin seems to fall as the related futures are nearing their expiry date. “Bitcoin sees dramatic price changes around CBOE futures expirations... We compiled some of the data and this indeed seems to be true,” Lee wrote in the report. Furthermore, Lee explained that the inflow of new capital to the crypto market this year has been insufficient to make up for the new supply coming from initial coin offerings (ICOs), mining rewards, and outflows due to capital gains taxes. Increased volatility in the underlying markets when futures contracts expire is a well-known phenomenon from stocks and other traditional financial markets. There have been six expirations since CBOE launched their bitcoin futures, with the most recent expiry being on Wednesday June 13.

Bitcoin price fell further after sellers managed to push the price below the USD 6,400 level. BTC/USD declined a few points below the USD 6,200 support, but later it managed to form a support base near the stated level.
The price started an upward correction and moved above the USD 6,300 level. However, there are many hurdles waiting around the USD 6,700. A break and close above the mentioned hurdle is needed for an upside break toward USD 7,000. Ethereum
Ethereum price settled below the USD 500 level and traded close to USD 450. Later, ETH/USD started an upward move and climbed above the USD 475 level. The price is currently up around 1% and is facing a tough resistance near the USD 500 level.
The price has to move above the USD 500 level to recover further in the near term. On the downside, supports are seen near the USD 460 and USD 450 levels. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price is still struggling as it settled below the USD 900 support. BCH/USD is currently up around 1%, but it is way below the USD 900 pivot level. Supports are seen on the downside around the USD 850 and USD 840 level.
Ripple price tested the USD 0.50 support level before starting a recovery. XRP/USD moved above the USD 0.52 resistance and is currently approaching a major resistance near the USD 0.5500 level. Other Altcoins Market Today

Last December, Tether was subpoenaed by the U.S Commodity Futures Trading Commission to provide proof that the digital currency was in fact back by a reserve of U.S. dollars. Bitfinex was also subpoenaed due to it losing banking relationships, but continued to remain operational. CEO of Bitfinex, JL van der Velde, spoke out against the accusations last year in an emailed statement and said: “Bitfinex nor Tether is, or has ever, engaged in any sort of market or price manipulation. Tether issuances cannot be used to prop up the price of Bitcoin or any other coin/token on Bitfinex.” Around this time, Bitcoin (BTC) reached its record high of $20,000 a coin, and these events are what prompted John M. Griffin and Amin Shams from the University of Texas Austin Department of Finance to investigate Tether’s movement. >> Is Day-Trading Ruining Bitcoin (BTC)? “Is Bitcoin Really Un-Tethered?” The 66-page research paper suggests that shows that Tether was “used to provide price support and manipulate cryptocurrency prices.” The paper claims that half of Bitcoin’s price rise within December 2017 was due to Tether and its issuer Bitfinex. The research paper says: “Using algorithms to analyze the blockchain data, we find that purchases with Tether are timed following market downturns and result in sizable increases in Bitcoin prices. Less than 1% of hours with such heavy Tether transactions are associated with 50% of the meteoric rise in Bitcoin and 64% of other top cryptocurrencies.” Griffin said in an interview that he’s “looked at a lot of markets” and manipulation in a market leaves tracks in the data. The data tracks with Tether are “very consistent” with a manipulation hypothesis. Griffin and Shams’s paper has been downloaded a total of 2,780 times today and currently has 7,645 abstract views. What will become of the research remains unknown at this time, but Tether (USDT) just passed DASH and Monero to become the 12th largest cryptocurrency by its market cap.

Well, a group of researchers are claiming these prices were artificially inflated, and some of their colleagues are saying they actually might be onto something. John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas, and Amin Shams, a graduate student, published a report entitled “Is Bitcoin Really Un-Tethered?”, which claims that Bitcoin’s December prices (and alt-coins’ prices, consequently) were manipulated by someone, or a group of people, through the use of the Tether cryptocurrency, and via the Bitfinex exchange - a cryptocurrency exchange that creates and sells Tether.  Tether, or USDT, is a cryptocurrency whose price always equals to that of the US dollar and is used to mediate when trading between different cryptocurrencies. This report, which you can find on this link, isn’t linked to any ‘hard’ evidence, like emails or related documents, but it does rely on numbers. It says that half of all the price surges Bitcoin has seen in the last year happened right after Tether flowed into a few accounts on different exchanges. Usually, this transfer would happen while the price was going down. Speaking to Bloomberg, the author says Tether was used to both stabilize and manipulate the price of Bitcoin.  “Bitfinex nor Tether is, or has ever, engaged in any sort of market or price manipulation,” Bitfinex Chief Executive Officer JL van der Velde said in an emailed statement, according to Bloomberg. “Tether issuances cannot be used to prop up the price of Bitcoin or any other coin/token on Bitfinex.” However, Griffin’s and Shams’ colleagues have voiced their opinions, and they’re saying this report could hold water, if nothing else - because similar methods have been used before to spot price manipulations. According to the New York Times, the report has gotten support from Philip Gradwell, the chief economist at Chainalysis, a blockchain research company, as well as Sarah Meiklejohn, a professor at the University College London (one of the early pioneers of this type of manipulation spotting). The US Justice Department is allegedly looking into possible Bitcoin price manipulation, as well. Also, as reported, the US regulator known as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has launched an investigation into potential price manipulation at four major cryptocurrency exchanges: Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Kraken.

Ratings agencies, including Fitch, S&P and Moody’s, are assessing the impact of bitcoin futures on credit rating. “[The impact on ratings] is something that we think is perhaps not fully appreciated by the market and something that warrants monitoring going forward,” Nathan Flanders, Global Head of Non-Bank Financial Institutions at Fitch Ratings, was quoted as saying.  “For banks, even though they are saying they are not directly engaging in the trading of cryptocurrencies as clearing members, they have some indirect exposure to it, whether they like it or not,” Flanders added. The move came as volumes in the bitcoin futures markets have increased steadily since December last year, when the markets went live on US exchanges CME and CBOE. This has happened despite the fact that the bitcoin price has been in a strong downtrend. On a single trading session on April 26, the combined volume of bitcoin futures on CME and CBOE reached an all-time high of USD 670 million, according to CCN. Although bitcoin futures are traded on exchanges regulated by the US government, the rising volume may have alarmed ratings agencies, which apparently have grown increasingly concerned of potential risks due to the volatility of the bitcoin price.

Bitcoin price is currently trading above the USD 6,750 level with consolidation moves. BTC/USD may correct a few points in the near term toward the USD 6,900 and USD 7,000 levels, which are likely to act as resistances for buyers.
Should there be an upside break above the USD 7,000 level, the price may continue to recover in the near term. On the flip side, if recoveries are capped by the USD 7,000 level, there could be a bearish reaction back towards USD 6,600 in the near term. Ethereum
Ethereum price also corrected higher and moved above the USD 510 and USD 520 levels. However, ETH/USD is facing a strong resistance near the USD 540 - USD 550 zone. An upside break above the mentioned zone is needed for the price to recover toward USD 600.
On the other hand, if the price fails to move past USD 550, there is a risk of another downside reaction towards the USD 510 and USD 500 support levels. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple

According to data from Coinbase, bitcoin dropped 10% to around USD 6,770 – the lowest level for the cryptocurrency since April 12. On Monday morning, the price was still hovering below the USD 6,800 level, after a slight increase during the early hours of the Asian trading session. The sell-off on Sunday followed news reports about a hack at Coinrail. The exchange said it was the victim of a “dawn raid” on its wallets on June 10, with hackers active on its system for up to 40 minutes, where they succeeded in accessing Pundi X (NPXS), Aston (ATX) and NPER funds. Some media reports claim Tron funds were also affected, and that the total losses may actually exceed USD 40 million, but the company has not yet issued confirmation. The company, which is the seventh biggest in the country by trading volume, says it has suspended all operations, and has safeguarded 70% of its customers’ funds. Also, Coinrail says it has successfully “frozen or recalled” some 66% of the hacked funds and stated that all of its assets are now in a cold wallet, where they will remain until the company’s network “has been stabilized.” Per a company statement, Coinrail also said it was working in close collaboration with the police. While most media sources in South Korea are claiming that over USD 37 million was taken, Coinrail is yet to confirm or deny these estimates, stating, “The exact extent of the damage is currently being calculated, and this may take some time.” The company said that it was unable to reveal many of the details of the hack as doing so “may interfere with the police investigation,” but added that it was in close talks with the coins’ developers. Joongang Ilbo points out that Coinrail had run into trouble with the Fair Trade Commission this year over clauses in its terms and conditions that appeared to absolve the company of blame in the event of “damages.” As reported previously on Cryptonews.com, a total of 12 exchanges (of which Coinrail was one) were ordered to make significant changes to “unfair” customer policies in April. The FTC claimed that exchanges’ terms “did not exempt them from liability” in the event of the loss or theft of customer funds. Exchange hackings have become a major issue for the cryptocurrency market in recent years, and continues to shake the market every time they occur. It is estimated that since 2014, hackings on exchanges have cost investors at least USD 1.4 billion. However, according to Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, a deeper analysis reveals that the media may be attributing too much of this plunge to the CoinRail hack.

The Financial Times reports that there is as much Bitcoin (BTC) owned by short-term speculators as there is by HODLers, or long-term investors, now. Blockchain research company Chainalysis discovered the Bitcoin data. This data shows that the amount of BTC held by day traders has increased to 5.1 million Bitcoin since December 2017. Bitcoin HODLers, people who have held BTC for longer than a year, together hold around 6 million Bitcoin. While these numbers aren’t quite on par yet, the chief economist at Chainalysis, Philip Gradwell, believes that this might be a “fundamental driver” behind the biggest crypto’s recent price decline. Gradwell explained that the growing number of Bitcoin day traders is causing a rise in liquidity for the coin, which could be part of what’s causing the Bitcoin price to drop. Other data discovered by Chainalysis should come as no surprise to most. Chainalysis also pointed out that a large amount of BTC is held by Bitcoin whales. Whales in crypto are typically large corporations or groups. There is around 17 million Bitcoin available and circulating. Of that, almost a third is held by only a few Bitcoin wallets. The Chainalysis data revealed that approximately 1,600 Bitcoin wallets each held about 1,000 BTCs, which, all together, would amount to around 5 million Bitcoin. This may also be affecting Bitcoin’s price. It’s very possible that the Bitcoin whales could be manipulating prices (for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies) to their advantage. If a whale sells some BTC, it’s enough to cause the price to drop, thus creating a chain reaction of FUD making others sell their BTC and making the Bitcoin price drop even further. Then, the whale(s) buy up even more BTC when the price is lower than they initially sold it for. This may or may not be happening, but there are concerns circulating that this could be the case.

Bitcoin has previously indeed started rising after hitting the USD 7,000 mark, and Sluymer believes this to be the first step in price recovery. “Bitcoin is stuck in purgatory,” Melissa Lee of CNBC begins, while Bob Pisani of the New York Stock Exchange says that the current narrow range of around USD 600 is unusual for Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. Bitcoin futures trading volume fell since May, with Asian markets less intimidated than the US ones. The US Securities and Exchange Commission regulatory issues are also considered one of the constraints for cryptocurrency prices recently. Growing numbers of trading desks for cryptocurrencies are also a surprising turn of events, as this may be the only area where those are rising. Guy Adami, an American trader, TV personality, and professional investor, considers this healthy, as it speaks of the marketplace maturing. Sluymer, meanwhile, points out that the long-term trend is still technically up when considering the graph of price fluctuation since 2016. All lows were a series of high lows compared to the previous ones. In his opinion, Bitcoin is currently in the bottoming phase, and now it’s at the point where it’s challenging its downtrend, but that it needs to get through USD 7,800 to prove its trend reversal. As previously reported, according to a popular crypto analyst, Willy Woo, the USD 8,000 support was bound to give up. He thinks that the next support sits near USD 7,000, which may perhaps break if sellers remain in control.

Bitcoin price started a minor downside correction and traded below the USD 7,700 level. BTC/USD is currently trading flat around the USD 7,600 (GMT 09:10 AM) level with immediate supports near USD 7,580 and USD 7,550. Below this last, the price will most likely retest the USD 7,400 support.
To the topside, the recent high near USD 7,750 may perhaps prevent upsides in the short term. Should bitcoin buyers succeed in clearing the USD 7,750 resistance, there could be more gains toward the USD 8,000 level in the near term. Ethereum
Ethereum was confined in a tiny range below the USD 620 resistance. ETH/USD attempted to break the USD 615 and USD 620 resistance levels on a couple of occasions, but it failed.
The price may decline a few points, but the USD 600 and USD 590 support levels are likely to prevent declines. On the flip side, a break above the USD 620 barrier may possibly open the doors for a push toward the USD 640 - USD 650 zone. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price is down around 2.5% to USD 1,110. BCH/USD struggled to settle above the USD 1,140 level, which ignited a bearish reaction. The price must stay above the USD 1,100 support to bounce back. If not, it could decline towards the USD 1,060 support.
Ripple price is still above the USD 0.65 support level. However, XRP/USD started a minor corrective wave from the USD 0.675 resistance. The pair may correct a few points more in the short term, but it is likely to find a strong buying interest around USD 0.65.  Other Altcoins Market Today

Although the SEC has previously denied permitting Bitcoin ETF trading, two asset management firms have collectively submitted a new application to introduce regulated Bitcoin ETF’s (Exchange-Traded Funds). SolidX Management LLC and New York-based asset manager Van Eck Associates Corp said their new product would cover all the concerns that the SEC has highlighted in their previous denial.  “I believe that Bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios,” Jan van Eck, the chief executive officer of VanEck, said in a statement.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com The main targeted investors for this ETF are institutional investors rather than retail traders. This is due to the SEC’s warning that cryptocurrencies carry a higher risk for retail investors. The high price tag of $200,000 per share is an indication that institutional investors are taking interest in regulated Bitcoin ETF’s. SEC had also raised concerns about a lack of transparency on online platforms, which they believe are much easier to manipulate.

For example, one of the smallest countries in the EU, Slovenia, has announced that its largest shopping center, already named BTC City, will transform into a complete Bitcoin city. Meanwhile, farmers and small businesses in a Russian village have ditched the ruble in favor of cryptocurrency for local trade. Slovenia, the country of origin for one of the oldest crypto exchanges Bitstamp, has announced that every store in BTC City shopping mall will accept cryptocurrency and operate via blockchain technology, Bitcoin Magazine reported. The mall contains over 500 retail stores. It presently holds several travel and tourism ventures, a luxury hotel and casino, a multiplex cinema, a waterpark and the Crystal Palace office park. Representatives of BTC City said, “The development of BTC City into a Bitcoin city is an important step toward the realization of BTC’s openness-oriented strategy, providing its customers and business partners with both freedom and choices regarding their purchases with new forms of payment.” Meanwhile, farmers and small businesses in the Russian village Kolionovo, 80 miles from Moscow, chose to pay with a cryptocurrency called Kolion instead of the ruble because banks charged huge interest rates when lending, CNN reported. A banker turned farmer Mikhail Shlyapnikov created the currency by issuing paper kolions in 2014 which was banned by Russian court in 2015, which made him go for a crypto version, raising USD 500,000 in an initial coin offering. Kolions can’t be mined, but are instead either bought or “plowed” - helping the villagers with farming and construction. Shlyapnikov told CNN, “We now have about USD 2 million in kolions because its value has jumped since the ICO,” and adds that the coin is backed by a reserve of 500 Bitcoin. In his opinion, this cryptocurrency is a way for them to insulate themselves from Russia's financial system.",27.420000000000073,1

It broke a major hurdle near USD 7,650 to place itself in a bullish zone. Similarly, major altcoins gained traction and are currently slowly moving higher. It seems like the crypto market is setting up for more gains in the near term considering the current sentiment remains intact. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price traded higher and cleared a couple of important resistances such as USD 7,650 and USD 7,700. BTC/USD traded close to the USD 7,800 level before retreating to USD 7,710. On the downside, supports are seen near USD 7,650 and USD 7,600, followed by the all-important USD 7,500.
On the upside, the USD 7,750 and USD 7,780 levels are short-term resistances. A push above this last could clear the path for an upside acceleration above the USD 7,800 level to test the USD 8,000 barrier. Ethereum
Ethereum remained stable above the USD 600 handle with positive signs. It seems like ETH/USD is currently consolidating above USD 600 (GMT 9:00 AM) and is preparing for the next major break.
Should the price settle above USD 620, there could be a test of the USD 650 resistance. On the flip side, a downside break below USD 600 may perhaps call for a larger bearish correction toward the USD 570 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price is slowly grinding higher and is currently up more than 1% to USD 1,150. BCH/USD is likely to continue higher towards the USD 1,180 and USD 1,200 resistance levels. On the downside, supports are seen near the USD 1,120 and USD 1,100 levels.
Ripple price is performing really well, and it might soon test the USD 0.70 resistance. A break above the stated resistance will most likely set the pace for a test of the USD 0.75 barrier. Supports on the downside are at USD 0.665 and 0.650.  Other Altcoins Market Today

The challenge comes courtesy of a new peer-reviewed study, released on Wednesday, June 6, 2018.  Six months ago, Grist, an environmental magazine, wrote about Bitcoin’s energy footprint. Fast forward to June of 2018, and a new study has found that Bitcoin’s energy footprint has more than doubled since that article was first published. There’s more, though. The study also reported that Bitcoin’s energy footprint is likely to double again by the end of 2018. If this happens, Bitcoin will be eating up 0.5% of the globe’s electricity. For perspective, that’s roughly as much as the Netherlands.  Now, this information might not be new to everyone, but it’s likely to still have a shock factor. The author of the study, Alex de Vries, has posted these calculations before, but this is the first time Bitcoin’s energy footprint has been published in an academic journal. Being published in a peer-reviewed journal is important as it means the information included is true. No fake news. These articles go through extensive rounds of fact-checking and are written by credible sources.  By late 2019, the study found that Bitcoin could be using more electricity than all the solar panels in the world currently produce. This is roughly 1.8% of global electricity.  As concerning as this is, it’s not like it is new information to the world. Numerous countries, like Canada and Iceland, have openly stated that crypto energy consumption is getting marginally out of hand. Specifically, Iceland and Canada have spoken of too much energy being used for cryptocurrency mining projects. However, Iceland said that even though it knows the risks, it’s still going to put most of its energy towards the crypto sector.  This is a troubling trajectory. Why? Well, for starters, we are living in a world that should be restraining our energy use and fighting Global Warming. Instead, we are using more energy than we can afford to use, and it’s for something that not everyone can benefit from or wants to benefit from.  That’s just a few people’s opinions, though. What do you think? Speaking of Bitcoin, the virtual currency is still below the $8,000 mark on the market.

Brad Garlinghouse – who previously predicted that only a few altcoins would exist in the next few years, now says Bitcoin doesn’t have the potential to become the global currency. The CEO, however, thinks Bitcoin will continue to work as the store of value; saying “We as a world have decided to store the value to the tune of about $130 billion… that’s a store of value. It’s hard to argue that.”  Source Image: firefox Although he claims that there is no competition among cryptocurrencies, he still believes that Bitcoin cannot compete with XRP as a means of transfer of payments. Brad Garlinghouse has continuously been criticizing Bitcoin’s dominating position in cryptocurrency markets. He thinks Ripple is in a better place to lead the cryptocurrency market considering mass adaptation from banks and payment services companies. Explaining his stance, the CEO said, “the Bitcoin blockchain, the technology that underpins the cryptocurrency, is “quite slow,” whereas XRP transactions are “a thousand times faster.” Bitcoin blockchain network on average takes 42 minutes for each transaction based on Blockchain.info record while XRP’s transaction stands in the range of four seconds.

Still, every time something new about the mysterious creator surfaces, the community wants to know - at least to add some level of humanity to their hero. Although she/he/they vanished - not quite in a puff of smoke - there are some proverbial breadcrumbs left behind, especially in Bitcoin’s whitepaper. He also posted in some forums and exchanged emails with some early Bitcoin developers. One of them was Laszlo Hanyecz, best known for buying two pizzas using 10,000 Bitcoins, now worth USD 77 million, which brought the Bitcoin Pizza Day to life as some sort of holiday. According to Business Insider, Hanyecz had been mining bitcoins on his laptop and he expressed interest in contributing to the cryptocurrency's development online. The developer claims that over the coming year, Nakamoto sent him tasks to complete.  Hanyecz calls Nakamoto paranoid, bossy and kind of weird. “He seemed very paranoid about people breaking the software. He kept calling it ‘prerelease,’ and I was helping him get it to release,” he explains. Apparently, Nakamoto consistently gave him a weird feeling.  He says the Bitcoin creator treated him like a full-time employee, although he did the work for Bitcoin for free and as a side gig, since he had a full-time job already.  Also, Nakamoto wasn’t too thrilled with Hanyecz’s mining, either. “He said, ‘Well, I'd rather not have you do the mining too much,’” Hanyecz said. “He was trying to grow the community and get more commerce use cases. He fully recognized that mining would become a thing where a few people would get wealthy.”  Still, the developer says he has deep respect for both Nakamoto's project and the person or team behind the name.",28.00999999999931,1

Bitcoin price is currently trading 2.5% higher to USD 7,620 (GMT 09:30), with an immediate resistance near the USD 7,680 level. Above this, the BTC/USD pair will most likely accelerate gains towards the USD 7,800 and USD 8,000 resistance levels.
On the flip side, if the price starts a downside correction, the USD 7,500 level may act as a decent support. Below the stated USD 7,500 support, the next key support zone is near the USD 7,400 and 7,350 levels. Ethereum
Ethereum jumped back above the USD 600 barrier, which is a positive sign. However, ETH/USD is struggling to gain upside momentum above the USD 610 and USD 620 resistance levels. Once there is a break above USD 620, the price will most likely revisit the USD 650 zone.
A bearish reaction from the current levels may perhaps push the price back in a negative zone below USD 600. The next key supports on the downside are at USD 580 and USD 575. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple

Cryptocurrency market analysts are blaming declining trader’s interest for the bearish trend over the last couple of months. They believe Bitcoin needs substantial fundamental support to rebuild trader’s confidence, either from its network or through Wall Street investments.

Searches for Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are also down more than 70% in the past five months. Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, has shown his concerns on declining trader attention towards bitcoin and other digital currencies.

Indeed, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee believes Bitcoin is offering a strong buying opportunity for long-term investors, as he expects the largest coin to trade around $25K by the end of the year.  Bears emphasize that a decline in Bitcoin searches in Google is an indication of a lack of trader interest in digital coins. Bitcoin searches dipped almost 75% since the start of this year.  Tom Lee, on the other hand, believes that Google search trends aren’t a price performance indicator; saying “Google searches aren’t the leading indicator for Bitcoin, but instead, acts as a ‘coincident indicator,’ and therefore shouldn’t be looked to as some sort of BTC price predictor. Tom Lee admits that Bitcoin trading volume dropped 80% from December’s high. However, he says “December was the parabolic blow-off for Bitcoin.” He thinks such break out moments are always short-term and comparing trading volume to unusual trading activity isn’t a wise strategy for price prediction.  He said, “Compared to just the second half of last year, Bitcoin volumes are up forty percent. And compared to a year ago, [over] the same time (i.e., January to June), Bitcoin volumes are up nine hundred percent.”  Several stock market experts have been predicting a complete crash for Bitcoin and the rest of the digital currencies. They believe the lack of backing from real assets and regulatory pressures could kill cryptocurrency prices in the days to come. The huge price volatile also reduces its potential to work as a viable medium of exchange. Tom Lee has discarded these claims. He says – “Bitcoin mining cost will work as the floor in the case of a price crash. From the Bitcoin bear market in December 2013 to January 2015, Bitcoin bottomed at its mining cost.”    Featured Image: twitter",132.86000000000058,1

Before Tom Lee, Nick Colas was the first Wall Street analyst to cover Bitcoin back in 2013, and he is bearish on BTC at the moment. Colas spoke to CNBC yesterday and states that he has yet to see new adopters wanting to buy Bitcoin recently, and with any new technology new adopters make it more valuable. Colas gives to reasons as to why investors should halt on purchasing the cryptocurrency. First, google searches are down over 90% since Bitcoin’s peak in December and second, Bitcoin wallet growth has slowed down since last year. With that being said, Colas believes that the sharp drop in December and January was the crypto ‘bubble’ popping, but he’s a strong believer in its structure and technology.

Most searches for the cryptocurrency came from Nevada and Arizona, within the United States. Tron (TRX) launched its main net a week ago and barely received a spike in Google search traffic.

In the case of Bitcoin, Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, a provider of a market insight newsletter, found the correlation between the growth of the number of wallets and the cryptocurrency prices that says Bitcoin wallet growth needs to be +5% per month to see meaningful price appreciation, CNBC reported. However, wallet growth was roughly 2% percent in both April and May.  According to Colas, Bitcoin needs a new narrative in order to reestablish global attention.

While we love the idea of Bitcoin (and own a little ourselves), we are not fans of buying it at current levels.”  Bitcoin price chart: Bitcoin prices have been struggling this year, especially compared to the all-time high in December. However, interest in Bitcoin is struggling too: Google searches for the term have dropped more than 75% since the beginning of this year and roughly halved over three months. Meanwhile, ICOs are struggling as well. Although the total for this year (USD 9.1 billion) already shot past the total for the entirety of 2017 (USD 6.6 billion), when removing EOS (USD 4.1 billion raised) and Telegram (USD 1.8 billion raised), the monthly trend look severely down. Research by Autonomous Next implies that this dragging is due to “continued regulatory uncertainty, tax overhang, and a lack of tangible progress in software adoption by the mainstream consumer.” However, the research firm goes on to say that we may be “entering the era of mega deals.” Japan is already moving forward with the crypto craze: from Rakuten, an e-commerce and Internet company, tokenizing USD 9 billion of loyalty points, to Mitsubishi bank talking about launching a cryptocurrency. And although last year, most of the projects were built by new teams, this year we are seeing a surge of mid-stage companies (50-250 employees) tokenizing some asset of their existing operations. This implies the possibility of late-stage companies entering the market soon as well, according to Autonomous Next.

Economists and market pundits have been closely watching Bitcoin mania; some of them are comparing it to teh Dutch Golden Age Tulip Mania, while a few are showing confidence in its future fundamentals. The debate over the shocking Bitcoin price movement and its ability to exist for the long-term hasn’t settled up. Until now. Joost van der Burgt, policy advisor at Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, however, believes that Bitcoin is a bubble which is close to bursting. The advisor has explicitly explained his thesis using five key indicators: The market has already crossed the first three stages of the cycle as the economist thinks the Bitcoin bubble is currently in the fourth stage of the cycle. He claims the displacement stage started occurring during the early age of Bitcoin – which then changed into the boom phase last year. Explaining the boom period, he said, “The ‘boom’ phase is characterized by prices rising slowly at first, but then gaining momentum as more and more participants enter the market, fearful of missing out.” The advisor further believes that the rush of entering the market has forced traders to borrow money to finance their investments. He calls it “Euphoria” (stage three of the cycle) – which he believes occurred together with the boom stage. The market has already entered the profit-taking stage according to Joost van der Burgt. He says the massive selloff in Bitcoin price indicates that investors are capitalizing on gains that Bitcoin generated during the last year.  Bitcoin price is down almost 60% from the all-time high amid traders selling strategy.

The best part was a close above the USD 7,500 pivot level in BTC/USD, opening the doors for more upsides. Ethereum also broke the USD 600 barrier and traded above USD 625. At the moment, prices are correcting lower, but approaching important weekly support levels. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price broke the USD 7,500 level and traded towards USD 7,750 where sellers appeared. BTC/USD started a downside correction, but the previous resistance at USD 7,500 is now likely to act as a strong support.
Looking at the higher timeframe charts, the price is placed nicely in a bullish zone with weekly supports at USD 7,500, USD 7,400 and USD 7,250. On the upside, bitcoin buyers are facing major barriers near the USD 7,800 and USD 8,000 levels. Above this last, the price may perhaps move towards USD 8,500. Ethereum
Ethereum performed really well and broke a crucial resistance at USD 600. ETH/USD traded close to the USD 640 level before correcting 3% to USD 605. The pair must hold the USD 600 and USD 580 support levels to stay in the bullish zone. 
Below USD 580, the next major weekly support sits at USD 520. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near USD 630 - USD 640. A push above USD 640 could take the price towards the next key resistance at USD 690. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price broke the USD 1,100 resistance and even cleared the USD 1,200 level before sellers took a stand. BCH/USD corrected lower and moved below USD 1,150. It is currently down 1% to USD 1,125, with weekly supports at USD 1,100 and USD 1,040. Resistances are at USD 1,200 and USD 1,250.
Ripple also gained bullish momentum and settled above the USD 0.65 resistance. As long as the XRP/USD pair is above the USD 0.62, it remains in an uptrend towards USD 0.70 and USD 0.75. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins traded higher recently, but most of them are correcting lower today. A few altcoins to watch out this week are VeChain, Mixin, Tron, EOS, Bancor, Golem, Polymath and BNB.

Market pundits were predicting that Bitcoin price had hit the bottom of the bear run earlier this week when the coin traded at around the $7,000 level; saying the cryptocurrency markets are undervalued following the most recent selloff.    Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Buying during the dip and selling during the high has always been considered a smart investing strategy and Dan Morehead –founder of Pantera Capital Management, is a current advocate of this practice: “All cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now. It’s much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes,” Morehead said Thursday on “Fast Money.” Bitcoin Buying Opportunity? Why Does Dan Morehead Anticipate a Rally? Bitcoin price and the rest of digital currencies have posted significant losses in the last three consecutive weeks. The selloff has pulled the total cryptocurrency market close to $300 billion, down more than 60% from the all-time-high it achieved at the beginning of the year.  The founder of Pantera Capital Management says that the market has reached the bottom of this year. He anticipates upcoming investments from Wall Street will push the prices higher in the next couple of quarters. “Many institutions are essentially buying the rumor [of potential SEC regulations] and selling the fact,” he said. “Getting invested now so that in three, four, five months when the institutional, quality-regulated custodians that we’re hearing about come online, they’ll already have their positions.” >>Mount Everest Crypto Stunt – the Craziest Thing to Happen in Crypto in May!

However, BTC/USD seems to be facing a tough challenge near the USD 7,600 and USD 7,650 resistance levels. On the other hand, altcoins are slowly moving higher and many major cryptocurrencies are poised to break key resistance levels, including Ethereum and ADA. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price remained confined in a range below the USD 7,600 and USD 7,650 resistance levels (GMT 09:00). A successful break and close above USD 7,620 - USD 7,650 is needed for additional gains towards USD 8,000 in the near term.
On the downside, the USD 7,400 level is a crucial support. As long as BTC/USD is above USD 7,400, the pair remains in an uptrend. Should there be a downside break below USD 7,400, the price may move back in a bearish zone to test the USD 7,250 and USD 7,000 support levels. Ethereum
Ethereum is grinding higher and is currently up around 2.8% to USD 585. It seems like the ETH/USD pair may continue to move higher and it could accelerate gains above the USD 600 barrier.
On the flip side, if there is no upside break above USD 600, the price could correct lower. Supports on the downside are seen near USD 560 and USD 550. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is flirting with the USD 1,000 handle. The BCH/USD pair struggled to move above the USD 1,040 resistance, but at the same time, it held the USD 960 support. It seems like the pair might trade in a range for a few more hours before the next break either above USD 1,040 or below USD 960. Ripple price is gaining upside momentum and is currently up 1.5% to USD 0.615. On the upside, XRP/USD is facing resistances near USD 0.62 and USD 0.625. A break above these could push the price towards USD 0.64.  Other Altcoins Market Today
The overall altcoins market is trading in the green zone and if sentiment improves further, there could be more gains. Today, coins such as IOTA, VERI, HT, Ontology, BNB, Bitcoin Private, KNC and NAS gained bullish traction and moved higher between 8-15%.

However, economists understand that bubbles are complex things that can’t be recognized without fail before they pop.  According to US economist Hyman Minsky, a bubble has five stages: displacement, boom, euphoria, profit-taking, and panic. If Bitcoin is a bubble, it is at the profit-taking stage with the panic stage just around the corner, Joost van der Burgt, a policy adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, wrote in a recent paper called ""Making Sense of Bitcoin Price Levels"". The displacement phase was after the release of the coin’s whitepaper in 2008, according to him. Back then, very few people knew about Bitcoin, and trading volume and price were small - the first time Bitcoin broke through USD 100 was in 2013, four years after its inception. Van der Burgt writes that the next stage, the boom, was obvious: “The subsequent ‘boom’ phase is characterized by prices rising slowly at first, but then gaining momentum as more and more participants enter the market, fearful of missing out.” Euphoria comes with the hype remaining even as the prices lose their volatility: “The euphoria phase is also when people start to borrow extensively to finance their investments. According to a recent survey, 18% of active bitcoin investors have financed their investments by credit card, and 22% of this group indicated that they have not yet paid off their credit card balance,” he explains. This means now is the profit-taking stage, where savvy investors leave, preparing the ground for the panic stage which would see prices crashing. It may not come to pass after all, however: “Then again, maybe bitcoin is different than anything we have seen before, and maybe a decade from now its market capitalization will be sky-high as it attains the status of a new global currency.” Bubble stages: Bitcoin price chart: Meanwhile, Dan Morehead, founder of Pantera Capital Management, a crypto investment firm, told CNBC that ""all cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now"" and encouraged to buy now and ""participate in the rally as it goes"".",40.75,1

The Bitcoin price bull-run seems to have paused after increasing skepticism from economist and technical analysts; they continue revealing bearish outlooks for Bitcoin in both the short and the long-run.   Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Robert Shiller – who is a famous economist and early predictor of both the dot-com bubble and the housing crash, has revealed that Bitcoin will eventually die either in the next few quarters or a hundred years from now. He thinks that Bitcoin is akin to all other monetary forms that failed after being short lived. “Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work. That mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal.” Shiller wrote The Economist has presented two compelling and meaningful scenarios for the world’s leading cryptocurrency.  The first scenario is Bitcoin could change its entity entirely if it exists 100 years from now. Shiller believes that increasing innovations in blockchain technologies and digital coins could completely change its existing features in the following decades. “Bitcoin won’t look anything like it is today. It will have a different name, if it exists,” Shiller said Tuesday on CNBC’s. Bitcoin price could crash significantly in the short-term, according to Robert Shiller’s second scenario. He thinks Bitcoin price could lose 80% of its value in the coming days, as its charm is fading away and people are starting to ignore it.   Source Image: twitter.com Like many other big names in the global financial sphere, Robert Shiller also calls Bitcoin a “Bubble”, meaning it will eventually have a bad ending. The response to Shiller’s claim was mixed. Bulls, however, doesn’t believe in Shiller’s theory. They claim the economist’s theory is too vague considering the requirement of a long time-frame.

Bitcoin price corrected lower and tested the USD 7,300 support area. Later, BTC/USD bounced back and is currently trading above the USD 7,500 level (GMT 09:00 AM). On the upside, an initial resistance sits at USD 7,600, followed by USD 7,620.
A successful break above USD 7,620 will most likely open the doors for a test of USD 8,000. On the downside, the USD 7,400 level is an important support. Below this, the price may perhaps retest the USD 7,300 and USD 7,250 support levels. Ethereum
Ethereum completed a downside correction and is currently trading 1.5% higher to USD 570. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 580, above which the price could accelerate above USD 600.

Also, he stressed that Bitcoin is not a bad thing: “I don’t mean to be dismissive of Bitcoin.

Retailers, restaurants, and even credit card companies refuse to support cryptocurrencies due to this price volatility. As a more-than-apt example, the cryptocurrency market cap gained $30 billion in the last twenty-four hours alone, after wiping off $150 billion in the previous three weeks.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Important investment figures such as Warren Buffett have refused to invest in cryptocurrencies due to the speculation surrounding price movement.

Mr. Greenspan said: “I don’t think the volatility is going to go away any time soon, especially since we still have a lot of bitcoin ‘whales’ or people who are involved in bitcoin early on who have amounted a massive amount stockpile.  Source Image: twitter.com Market participants, on the other hand, are also blaming regulators for the price volatility. They believe regulators could kill the price volatility if they imposed hard rules that reduce unfair practices and price manipulation activities. But then the point of crypto was to be decentralized, so is this not a complete contradiction? Wasn’t an ideology of “no regulation” part of the thrill of Bitcoin? Combined with price volatility, increasing competition from other market players, including Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ripple (XRP) is making it hard for Bitcoin to achieve global acceptability. Answering the question of “how long Bitcoin price takes for complete stabilization?”, Mr Greenspan said, “Over time, if we are looking at decades into the future, once the adoption rate of bitcoin is normal and has reached full market penetration, which we are nowhere near at the moment, and once you see more distribution and more liquidity in the market, I believe we can then have a much more stable price fluctuation,” Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Tzido",-63.20999999999913,0

The current market sentiment is positive, signaling more gains in the short term. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price surged higher and broke the USD 7,250 and USD 7,400 resistance levels. BTC/USD is currently up by 5.2% to USD 7,500 (GMT 9:00 AM), with an immediate resistance at USD 7,540. Above this, the price must break the USD 7,600 barrier for more gains in the near term.
On the downside, the broken supports at USD 7,400 and USD 7,250 are likely to act as supports if the price corrects lower. Below USD 7,250, the price could move back in the bearish zone towards USD 7,000. Ethereum
Ethereum price also formed a solid support near USD 500 and started an upward move. It traded up by more than USD 50 and tested the USD 570 resistance.
ETH/USD is currently up by 7.5% to USD 560, with an immediate resistance at USD 570. A break above this could open the doors for a push towards the all-important USD 600 resistance. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple

Market dynamic and investor sentiments have changed substantially however in the past few months; cryptocurrency mania now seems to be cooling down – despite a much higher adaptation than ever before for blockchain technology. Google Trends, for instance, shows a vast and constant decline of public interest in Bitcoin and other emerging cryptocurrencies. This is mainly due to the massive level of volatility in cryptocurrency markets. The speculation based price movement has also erased trader’s interest.  The BTC coin rose to an all-time high of $19,000 level at the beginning of the year before crashing to $6,000 on Feb 6. It continued the huge sideways moves in the following months. BTC price moved sharply higher earlier this month to around $9,900 before losing all the gains in last three consecutive weeks. The study from UK’s Warwick Business School, which is ranked at the first spot in the Financial Times online MBA program in 2018, shows that cryptocurrencies are not reliable saving instruments, even in the short-term. The demand is driven by past prices, or simple emotion, rather than by economic fundamentals, according to UK’s Warwick Business School findings.  Several researchers and market analysts are comparing Bitcoin and other digital currencies with the dot-com bubble.

This is the origin of the 51% attack - where the system needs a majority vote to reach consensus. Although a 51% attack in a large distributed network, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum etc. is highly unlikely due to sheer size, smaller coins face a bigger risk simply because there are fewer participants, which makes it easier to manipulate. This is why the website crypto51 was made: a collection of coins and the theoretical cost of a 51% attack on each network, it is not meant to encourage attacks, but to get people talking about the problem and potential solutions. As to how it works, the website explains: “Using the prices NiceHash [a Slovenian cryptocurrency cloud mining marketplace] lists for different algorithms we are able to calculate how much it would cost to rent enough hashing power to match the current network hashing power for an hour.”  Bytecoin is an example of 51% attack potential: with a market cap of around USD 1 billion, it can be 51% attacked for only USD 557, according to the website. While hackers targeting coins such as Bata, Startcoin, Halcyon and some others would require only a few bucks to attack these networks. Since NiceHash doesn’t have the hashing power for larger coins, the website also lists the percentage of the needed hashing power that is available from Nicehash. The attack cost does not include the block rewards that the miner will receive for mining. In either case, recently there have been a number of 51% attacks including attacks on Verge and Bitcoin Gold.  Also, there was in fact a moment, in 2014, when the mining pool Ghash.io came close to obtaining 51% of the whole Bitcoin network. But then some members of the pool voluntary left, decreasing its share. Still, Bitcoin experts believe a 51% attack is very unlikely as its cost would exceed the possible benefits and it would most likely hurt the very attacker. Moreover, such an attack can’t be used to steal bitcoins or change older transactions, as the attacker would be only able to double spend his/hers funds from a recent transaction. Also, any attack would only last for a short time before being quickly fixed by the Bitcoin community.  Bitcoin evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos on 51% Bitcoin attack:",343.1300000000001,1

Bitcoin price is currently trading above the USD 7,000 (GMT 08:45 AM) support in a tight range. It seems like BTC/USD is consolidating losses and is preparing for the next move. Should there be a bearish break below USD 7,000, the price may perhaps drop to USD 6,500.
On the flip side, if buyers take the stage, bitcoin price could recover towards the USD 7,500 resistance. A successful break above the USD 7,500 resistance is needed for buyers to take control. Ethereum
Ethereum price is also trading near a key support level at USD 500. ETH/USD must hold the stated support to avoid a crash towards USD 450.

Bitcoin cash is currently trading near the USD 880 - USD 900 support. If BCH/USD fails to recover from the current levels, it may possibly decline further towards the USD 800 handle. Alternatively, a recovery could take the pair towards the USD 1,000 barrier.

He says: “certainly”, but then added, “But I would bet Bitcoin ends at least above $10,000 in the year.” Bogart’s claim for the potential upside is based on higher institutional adaptation. He said, “The long-term thesis is very much intact… The institutionalization of Bitcoin is absolutely occurring…Every major bank is trying to do something in the space. Either they’re going to be offering Bitcoin to their clients, they’re working on a custody platform, or they’re opening up a trading desk.” While the Wall Street expert was bullish on Bitcoin’s price outlook, he recommended selling some altcoins that are overvalued.

However, the survey also required there to be personal data filled out that many did in the belief they were doing it confidentially.  (courtesy BBC) West subsequently compiled this data and sold it on the Deep Web to other scammers through the now-defunct Dark Market known as Alpha Bay. He used the pseudonym “Courvoisier” for this purpose.  (courtesy: BBC) According to official information, he was able to raise £2 million worth in crypto (approximately $2.6M USD) from the sale of the “Fullz.” After tracking him down, the police were able to capture him on a train from Ryll to London. Subsequent investigations concluded that there was no attack on Just Eat’s internal servers or systems; however, the losses caused totaled figures in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. When police Raided Mr. West’s House, they found an sd card with the details of at least 63,000 credit cards, £2 million worth in crypto, 500gr of cannabis, seven million email addresses with passwords, and the corporate information of more than 500 companies. >>Addicted to Crypto Trading? There’s a Treatment Centre For That! According to the judge, the operation was a “one man cybercrime wave.” His words about West’s actions were harsh: “When such inadequate security is confronted with a criminal of your skills and ambition it is totally unfit for purpose and worthless… This case should be a wake-up call to customers, companies and the computer industry to the very real threat of cybercrime.” Mr. West, who pleaded guilty to the charges, received a 10-year sentence, while his girlfriend, Rachael Brookes, 26, was accused of trying to sell stolen information taken by her boyfriend, received a community order after pleading guilty to unauthorized access of computer material.

Having gotten into mining in 2009, early enough to make a fortune, he accidentally threw away the hard drive holding thousands of Bitcoins. “I mined more than 7,500 coins over one week’s time in 2009; there were just six of us doing it at the time, and it was like the early days of a gold rush,” the IT worker turned crypto investor told New York Post. “Four years later, I had two hard drives in a desk drawer. One was empty and the other contained my Bitcoin private keys. I meant to throw away the empty drive — and I accidentally threw away the one with the Bitcoin information.” He’s not the only one with such bad luck: Atlanta-based software developer Syl Turner mined two Bitcoins in 2010 and forgot about it. When the price started rising from November on, he found that old computer in the attic, but also found that he had overwritten his private key.  Meanwhile, Howells is still struggling to get his coins back. He’s even offered the town of Newport 10% of the Bitcoins’ value if they’ll let him excavate the landfill. So far, they’ve denied his requests. Still, he considers his coins to be perfectly safe there: “Nobody else can get in there and take my hard drive,” he said. “It’s like having [millions] in the bank, but you cannot get into the bank account.”",-235.32000000000062,0

Bitcoin price settled below the USD 7,600 and USD 7,500 support levels, opening the doors for more losses. Looking at the current market sentiment, there are many bearish signs, which could result in fresh lows this week. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently down around 1% to USD 7,220, with an immediate support at USD 7,150. A break below the stated USD 7,150 support will most likely push the price further lower towards the all-important USD 7,000 level.
If BTC/USD sellers remain in control during the following sessions, there is a risk of a downside break below USD 7,000. On the upside, weekly resistances are at USD 7,500 and USD 7,600. Above this last, the significant hurdle is at USD 8,000. Ethereum
Ethereum tumbled by more than 8% and declined below the last low near USD 550. ETH/USD is currently under heavy selling pressure and it could even test the USD 500 support. Below USD 500, there is an open space up to USD 440.
On the flip side, if the price corrects higher, the previous supports at USD 580 and USD 600 are likely to act as resistance. A daily close above USD 600 is must for a bounce back in ETH in the near term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price settled below a crucial support at USD 1,000, clearing the path for more declines. BCH/USD is currently down 6.5% to USD 925, with an immediate support at USD 900. Weekly resistances are at USD 980 and USD 1,000.
Ripple closed below USD 0.60, which is a strong bearish signal. XRP/USD may now decline further and it could test the next weekly support at USD 0.55, which is an important level. Other Altcoins Market Today
Almost all low cap altcoins declined today, including Nano, Tron, ICON, WAN, Kin, Zcash, KNC, Steem and others. Two altcoins, Civic and All Sports performed well and traded higher by more than 20%.  Overall, the current price action and technical structure is signaling a bearish bias.

He predicts a few coins – including Bitcoin (BTC) and EOS (EOS) will achieve robust price growths next month,  before collapsing in July. Bitcoin price currently trades around the $7,500 level but John McAfee expects BTC price to trade at around $15,000 next month.  He also predicts that EOS price will hit $32 next month.  Source Image: twitter.com Bears, however, don’t accept his price bet, as he’s backed claim on Trump’s meeting with the North Korean president. He tweeted: “My algorithm is still predicting the meeting between two leaders, which could take place in Japan next month.”    Source Image: twitter.com Donald Trump, on the other hand, publically denied meeting with the North Korean President after his offensive remarks. He also told Kim in the letter, “You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used.” Bears say, that Donald Trump has called off the meeting, but if he meets with Kim Jong-un would John McAfee’s prediction be correct? and what would be the fundamental impact on the cryptocurrency market be? Its right that political stability always has a positive impact on investment markets, so the meeting between the head of the two countries could have the potential to create a 100% rally in price. On the other hand, the stock markets, for instance, plunged only 1% after Donald Trump refused to meet with North Korean President.

BTC/USD formed a short-term bottom pattern with a strong bullish candle and recovered above USD 7,400. Similarly, all major altcoins including ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin and Neo corrected above key resistance levels. The current price action suggests that the market was well bid near weekly lows and prices could correct further higher during the following sessions. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently down 1.3% to USD 7,410 (GMT 8:00 AM) and is holding the USD 7,250 support. The last 4-hour chart was positive, suggesting a slight recovery above USD 7,600. However, the USD 7,600 - USD 7,700 zone is a crucial barrier for buyers. A successful close above the mentioned barrier could open the doors for a test of USD 8,000.
On the downside, price must hold the USD 7,250 support. If buyers fail to defend the stated USD 7,250, there may perhaps be a strong slide towards USD 6,900 in the near term. Ethereum
Ethereum price bounced back sharply and moved above the USD 600 level. However, ETH/USD struggled near the USD 610 - USD 615 region, and is currently down to USD 595. 
It seems like the price may move back above USD 600 during the coming sessions as long as it is above USD 575. Should there be a downside break below USD 575, the price may possibly decline further towards USD 550. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is showing a positive signs above USD 980. BCH/USD is currently up 2.2% to USD 1,010 and is moving with a bullish angle. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 1,040, followed by USD 1,080. Supports on the downside are at USD 980 and USD 960. Ripple managed to crawl back above USD 0.60, which is a positive sign. However, buyers need to push the price above the USD 0.62 resistance to accelerate upsides.  Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins gained traction today. Coins like Bitcoin Private, CyberMiles, Kin, EOS and Mixin surged higher by more than 10% to move in the green zone. Overall, if the recent bounce in bitcoin is real and the price settles above USD 7,500, there are real chances of BTC/USD gaining bullish momentum toward USD 8,000.

Novogratz, who is setting up cryptocurrency merchant bank Galaxy Digital LP, told Bloomberg, “Weeding out the bad actors is a good thing, not a bad thing for the health of the market.

Cryptocurrencies are the most volatile asset in the world, at least in this era.

Tom Lee has totally based his price bet on speculation that institutional investors will push prices higher later in the year. He said, “I think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest, and they haven’t really come into crypto yet because there is still some regulatory uncertainty. But that sort of ultimate allocation into crypto as an asset class is going to be a powerful reason why bitcoin rallies.”  Source Image: twitter.com Market reaction to Tom Lee’s claims was mixed.

The investigation primarily focuses on illegal practices that can influence the price of these coins, such as “spoofing” – flooding the market with fake orders to trick other traders into buying or selling. Another illicit tactic the DOJ is looking into is called ‘wash trading,’ which traders trade with themselves to create the illusion of volume. This tactic is prevalent in equity and futures markets. John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied market manipulation, told a reporter at Bloomberg, “There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading. It would be easy to spoof this market.” The DOJ’s investigation is still in its early stages and is following the country’s latest crackdown on various blockchain projects, in both Canada and the U.S. Cryptocurrency trading is fragmented in dozens of cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms across the globe, many of which are located in Asia and aren’t registered with the SEC or CFTC. The CFTC doesn’t regulate the trading of cryptocurrency, but if it finds fraud in the ‘spot market,’ it holds the authority to impose sanctions. Red Flags The Winklevoss Twins, who own the Gemini Exchange, conducted a surveillance of the digital coins being traded on their platform last month. The twins then urged other trading platforms to band together to potentially form a group that would ‘self-regulate’ the industry. It seems that the duo sensed the government oversight drawing near. Many market participants have alleged that cryptocurrency manipulation is rampant, and you can clearly see that by the hundreds of ‘pump’ tactics initiated a day.

It broke a key support area near USD 7,550 - USD 7,600, opening the doors for sellers to take control. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Neo and Cardano also followed BTC and declined sharply during the past three sessions.  However, according to experts the current drop won’t bother bitcoin bulls. In an email to CNBC, Fundstrat's Tom Lee, stated that the recent slide is mainly due to ""typical crypto volatility"". He still thinks that bitcoin could hit USD 25,000 despite the recent drop. Lee believes, who recently admitted he was wrong to predict the Consensus conference rally, that once institutional investors jump into the market, there could be solid gains in bitcoin. However, as reported yesterday, there may possibly be a correction going into the July-September period, followed by an accumulation phase. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is down roughly 3.8% to USD 7,530 (GMT 8:00 AM) with an immediate support at USD 7,500. If BTC/USD accelerate declines below the stated USD 7,500 support, the next major support is near the USD 7,200 level. Below this last, the price may perhaps test the USD 7,000 support.
On the upside, the price is facing a major resistance near USD 7,850. A successful close above USD 8,000 is must for bitcoin to bounce back.  Ethereum
Ethereum price was under a lot of pressure and it almost tested the USD 550 level. ETH/USD tumbled and settled below a key support at USD 600, which can be seen as a strong bearish sign.
At the outset, the price is currently correcting towards USD 600. However, the stated level will most likely act as a resistance and prevent gains above USD 605 - USD 610. On the downside, supports are at USD 650 and USD 660. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash traded lower sharply and even broke a crucial support near USD 1,000. BCH/USD is down 6% and is currently trading near USD 980. If sellers remain in control, the price could slide further towards the USD 950 support.

The constant bashing from business icons and trend makers are the most prominent drivers for the steep selloff. Bitcoin price lost 20% of its value since it hit the $9,900 mark on May 12. The selloff is quite surprising for bulls as they were expecting BTC price to generate solid gains considering Goldman Sachs, NASDAQ, and Intercontinental Exchange are all now backing the coin.    BKCM founder Brian Kelly was also stunned by the market behavior.

According a popular crypto analyst, Willy Woo, the USD 8,000 support was bound to give up. He thinks that the next support sits near USD 7,000, which may perhaps break if sellers remain in control. Finally, there may possibly be a correction going into the July-September period, followed by an accumulation phase. Technically, the recent break below USD 8,000 was significant. The price could test USD 7,000 as suggested in a tweet by Woo, but it has to stay above the last major low (USD 6,430) to avoid a significant collapse back to USD 5,000. Bitcoin
Today, bitcoin price is down 5.6% to USD 7,840 (GMT 9:00 AM). An immediate support is at USD 7,550, which is a crucial pivot zone. Therefore, if BTC/USD continues to move down, it might face a strong buying interest near USD 7,550. Below this last, the price will most likely head towards USD 7,000.
On the upside, the previous support at USD 8,000 is an important hurdle for buyers. A daily close above USD 8,000, followed by a push above USD 8,200 is required to decrease the current bearish pressure.  Ethereum

Bitcoin price remains range-bound after falling 15% from three months high of $9,900 level. The bearish trend has been receiving support from influential icons. The debate over the use of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange is also contributing to the sell-off. Bitcoin price trades around the $8,300 level today. Altcoins are in the red after a short rally at the beginning of the week.  The total cryptocurrency market hovers in the range of $380 billion, down from $465 billion it hit a few days ago.  Joe Davis, the chief economist for $5.1 trillion asset management firm Vanguard, thinks cryptocurrencies aren’t the alternative of fiat currency. His stance is similar to PayPal CFO and Warren Buffet – who already has rejected the possibility of using Bitcoin as the medium of exchange. The economist of the $5.1 trillion asset management firm warned investors that Bitcoin price is likely to crash to zero. He suggested investors keep their focus towards “tried and true asset classes”. He believes that allocating even a small portion of the investment portfolio to cryptocurrencies could turn out to be a big mistake. He said, “The investment case for cryptocurrencies is weak. Unlike stocks and bonds, currencies generate no cash flows such as interest payments or dividends that can explain their prices. National currencies derive their prices from the underlying economic activity of the countries that issue them. “ The economist further argued that cryptocurrencies could be used as a medium of exchange, but they don’t have a store of value. Although the majority of market participants believe the higher level of volatility in cryptocurrency prices makes it harder for the global community to use it as a medium of exchange, they think the market needs some time and more regulation clarity for complete stabilization.

Eight years ago, on this day in 2010, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz paid another Bitcoin talk forum user for two Papa John’s pizzas for the low, low price of 10,000 BTC (worth about USD 25 at the time.) Now, that amount would be worth around USD 80 million. Nobody is going to let him forget that. There is a Twitter account @bitcoin_pizza, that only tweets how much those pizzas are worth every day, and how it compares to the previous day. The #Bitcoin pizza is worth $83,131,600 today. (-2% from yesterday) Today is Bitcoin pizza day! Is Hanyecz sorry that he didn’t HODL? He said last year in an interview with the New York Times, “It wasn’t like Bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool. No one knew it was going to get so big.” And today, the whole crypto world celebrates. Searching “Bitcoin Pizza Day” on Facebook returns a long list of events all over the globe, marking this momentous occasion. Also, some people tweet their own Bitcoin pizzas, like Huobi, a cryptocurrency exchange, did. Of course, we’d wager that these are worth significantly less than USD 80 million, but they sport the Bitcoin logo, so it’s close enough. Across #HUOBI offices in the 🌏, we celebrate with bitcoiners the anniversary of the MOST expensive pizzas in history 🍕2 Papa John's pizzas for 10,000 BTC on 22nd May 2010.Watch what's #BitcoinPizzaDay at https://t.co/hvCleQJOTD#BTCPizzaDay #BitcoinPizza #Bitcoin #BTC pic.twitter.com/QPcTYdPoY6 Some companies are using this day to introduce and advertise new products.

Others tell you, “Don’t be so hard on yourself the next time you make a bad purchase!” In either case, you can look at it from another point of view as well: as Twitter user @marckenigsberg would put it, “8 years later and the price is exactly the same - 10,000 btc. It's just fiat that's devalued.” But don’t forget about the altcoins either. Ethereum community in Berlin, ETHBerlin is celebrating Döner Kebab ETHBerlin day, presumably not to be outdone by a pizza.

However, declines in BTC/USD were contained and it seems like the price is currently consolidating above the USD 8,200 support. There are a few negative signs emerging on charts, but none of them are convincing. This indicates that there could be more ranging moves before bitcoin buyers’ jump into action.  Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently down 2.3% to USD 8,315 (GMT 9:00 AM), with an immediate support at USD 8,250. However, the most important support sits near USD 8,200. Should buyers fail to keep the price above the USD 8,200 support, BTC/USD could tumble below USD 8,000. 
To the topside, an initial resistance is near USD 8,400. To gain upside momentum, the price has to move above USD 8,500, which is a key pivot zone.  Ethereum
Ethereum price failed to stay above the USD 710 and USD 700 support levels. ETH/USD is down roughly 2.5% and is currently trading near USD 694. A close above the USD 700 resistance is required for a decent bounce towards the next resistance at USD 720.
On the downside, the USD 680 is a short-term range support. A break below this may perhaps clear the path for ETH sellers to take control. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price once again declined below USD 1,200 and is currently down 5.5%. It seems like BCH/USD is trading in a broad range of USD 1,150 - USD 1,240. A proper daily close above USD 1,240 and 1,250 is needed for further gains towards USD 1,300.
Ripple is struggling to move above the USD 0.70 barrier. XRP/USD is currently down 3.7% to USD 0.672, with an immediate support at USD 0.665. On the upside, resistances are at USD 0.68 and USD 0.70. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, many altcoins corrected lower including ONT, bitcoin private, nano, lisk, DGB, golem, litecoin, tron and veChain. It seems like the current market sentiment is slightly bearish, suggesting chances of more downsides in the short term. However, if bitcoin price stays above USD 8,200 and buyers succeed in pushing the price above USD 8,500, the market could turn green once again.",-378.09000000000106,0

BTC/USD broke the USD 8,500 and USD 8,250 support levels and moved towards USD 8,000. However, downsides were limited and bitcoin price consolidated above USD 8,000 to stage a solid recovery. It bounced back and moved above the broken USD 8,250 support level. Other major cryptocurrencies followed bitcoin and gained bullish traction. Going forward, if bitcoin breaks the USD 8,700 resistance, prices may continue to move higher. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently up roughly 2.5% at USD 8,520 (GMT 9:10 AM) and is showing positive signs. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 8,550. However, weekly hurdles for buyers are at USD 8,700 and USD 9,000. Above this last, BTC/USD may well zoom towards the USD 10,000 resistance.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 8,250, which is also a pivot level. Should there be a break below USD 8,250, the price may accelerate declines towards the next weekly supports at USD 8,000 and USD 7,600. Ethereum
Ethereum formed a strong base near USD 650 and started an upward move. ETH/USD climbed higher and moved above the USD 680 and USD 700 resistance levels, opening the doors for more upsides.
The pair is currently up 1% to USD 718 and it seems like buyers are in control. Resistances on the upside are at USD 725 and USD 738. A push above the last barrier at USD 738 will most likely call for a test of USD 800 this week. Bitcoin Cash and RippleBitcoin cash price declined heavily this past week and almost tested the USD 1,100 level. However, buyers protected losses below USD 1,125 and the price recovered above USD 1,200. BCH/USD is up 3% today to USD 1,270, with weekly resistances at USD 1,300 and USD 1,360.
Ripple declined below the USD 0.70 support this past week, and it is currently still above the stated level. However, the current price action suggests that XRP/USD could break USD 0.70 and rise further towards the next weekly resistances at USD 0.72 and USD 0.75. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, TRON caught the market attention and TRX price climbed around 15% to break the USD 0.08 resistance. It seems like Tron’s mainnet launch on May 31st (GMT +8) is the main driver for the current bullish wave. If the current momentum stays intact, the price may well test the USD 0.10 level. A few other altcoins to watch out this week are XRP, Neo, RChain, DigiByte, WTC, WAN and Loom Network. Overall, the crypto market opened in the green zone this week, and further gains depend on whether bitcoin succeeds in clearing the USD 8,700 hurdle or not.",-103.34000000000015,0

Bitcoin price lost almost $1,800 in the last two weeks.  Several other industry experts are also refuting bitcoin’s potential to work as an alternate currency. They believe the higher level of volatility makes it difficult for the general public to use it as the medium of exchange.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Bitcoin price crashed to the $8,000 level today. The New York consensus summit also failed to fuel any rally for the largest coin. PayPal CFO John Rainey has rejected bitcoin’s potential to work as the medium of exchange, particularly for merchants that have low margins on their trades.  Source Image: twitter.com Rainey claims that merchants usually have a 10%-15% margin on their products. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has the potential to create price movements of 10%-15% in few hours alone – this makes it difficult for merchants to accept BTC as the tool of payment. Talking about the possibility of accepting Bitcoin in future, the CFO said, “You could have something that appeals to consumers, but if merchants don’t accept it, it’s of little value. Right now, we don’t see a lot of interest from our merchants. But if it’s something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we’ll certainly support that.”  Source Image: twitter.com The market has been apparently supporting Rainey’s stance. The price volatility in cryptocurrency markets is higher than any other asset or currency. Some market participants expect increasing regulators role could help in reducing the price volatility in the long-run.  Source Image: twitter.com Others reacted strongly to PayPal’s CFO’s comments.

Jack Ma Yun, Alibaba Group’s founder and executive chairman, spoke in a forum on Wednesday and spoke highly of blockchain technology, but expressed his doubts about Bitcoin (BTC). “There is no bubble for blockchain, but there’s a bitcoin bubble,” Ma said in a panel at the second World Intelligence Congress forum. Ma said he has been researching blockchain for years and highly believes in its potential to solve security, and data privacy. The founder thinks that blockchain can be used by everyone including individuals, corporations, and even governments. Ma expressed security a top priority for his company, as Alibaba conducts ‘trillions of transactions’ a quarter. Ma said: “Social networks may not need blockchain, but we are doing internet finance in which we process trillions of trading volume. We have to turn to blockchain, otherwise, it would be fatal.”  The company reported $39.9 billion in yearly revenue in its latest fiscal Q4 earnings release. Alibaba currently has 43 published blockchain patent applications, which is followed by Bank of America which has 33. Standing Ground Ma said he first saw blockchain as a privacy and security solution, but never thought to turn it into something like Bitcoin (BTC) to make money. Clearly, the founder doesn’t understand the need to break away from central banks and hasn’t read the official whitepaper. Ma is one of Asia’s richest men, and his latest attitude towards Bitcoin (BTC) highly resonates with the Chinese government’s recent actions. However, in an interview back in December 2017, the founder told CNBC Shanghai:  “I don’t know about Bitcoin at all. I’m particularly puzzled. Even if it can really work, the rules of global trade and the financial system will be completely changed… We have a team that studies blockchain, but Bitcoin is not something that I want to pursue. We don’t care about Bitcoin.” It seems that Ma has always felt this way about the digital token, and the e-commerce giant won’t ever see Bitcoin (BTC) on its platform.

As a result, there was a bearish reaction and prices dropped sharply. BTC/USD declined below the USD 8,250 support and ETH/USD settled below USD 700. The overall market sentiment is currently negative, and technical indicators are pointing more downsides in the near term.  Bitcoin
Bitcoin price struggled to move above the USD 8,450 and USD 8,500 resistance levels. BTC/USD moved down and broke many supports such as USD 8,300 and USD 8,250. It declined close to USD 7,900 before recovering. 
The price is currently down 1.8% to USD 8,100 (GMT 8:45 AM), with an initial support at USD 8,000. Below this last, the price could retest the recent low of USD 7,910 and it might even break USD 7,900. On the upside, resistances are seen near USD 8,250 and USD 8,300. A break above USD 8,300 will most likely push the price towards the USD 8,500 hurdle. Ethereum
Ethereum declined sharply, settled below the USD 700 support, and traded towards USD 650. ETH/USD found buyers just above USD 650 and started an upside correction.
It is currently down 2.8% to USD 678 and it seems like any further recoveries are likely to face sellers on the topside around USD 690 and USD 700. On the downside, supports are at USD 660, USD 655 and USD 650. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash trimmed most of its gains and declined by more than 6% to USD 1,200. BCH/USD is currently at a risk of more losses below USD 1,200. The next support is at USD 1,150 - USD 1,160. On the upside, resistances are at USD 1,220, USD 1,240 and USD 1,250.
Ripple traded towards USD 0.65 and is currently down 3%. XRP/USD is finding it really hard to attract buyers and it remains at a risk of more losses below USD 0.65. Other Altcoins Market Today
Almost all small cap coins traded in the red zone today, except Syscoin. SYS coin price gained by more than 15% to move above the USD 0.40 resistance. Syscoin was added to the masternodes.online platform, which was the main driving force for the current upside.

The largest coin has posted losses in last two consecutive days. This downside move is contrary to analyst’s predictions who were expecting a strong rally amid the New York consensus summit. Indeed, Tom Lee – who has predicted Bitcoin price to reach $25K by the end of this year – failed to predict the price movement during the consensus summit correctly.  Tom had anticipated bitcoin price to jump from 10% to 70% amid Coindesks conference. The price movement in the last three days was also quite contrary to historical precedents. BTC coin grew almost $2,000 in the previous year’s conference call, and it had made similar strides in 2014 and 2015. Two consecutive days of downside strides pulled Bitcoin price to an almost four-weeks-lows on Wednesday before moving back to $8,300 today. Although several experts presented the bullish outlook for cryptocurrency market during the New York conference call, bearish remarks from the Federal Reserve President at the beginning of the call created the selloff in the crypto markets. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said cryptocurrencies are operating like non-uniform currencies – which, at least historically, been discarded and replaced in global financial markets. The president also believes that Dollar is in the better position to work as the leader in currency markets. Bullard said. “The dollar, on the other hand, is backed by a stable government with direct and sensical monetary policy and persistently low inflation — because of that, it can better achieve the goals and meet the needs of the market.” The selloff also received support from Bing’s cryptocurrency ad-ban policy. Powered by Microsoft, Bing is the second largest search engine in the world. Bing considers cryptocurrency ads to be harmful to their audience due to their unregulated nature. The Microsoft policymaker said, “Because cryptocurrency and related products are not regulated, we have found them to present a possible elevated risk to our users, with the potential for bad actors participating in predatory behaviors or scamming consumers.” Featured Image: twitter",-275.72999999999956,0

Many experts estimated that the conference in New York could spark a much needed rally in bitcoin. However, there was no major upward move in bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies.  According to Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, the prior Consensus rallies have yielded gains between 10% and 70%. Before the conference, he expected the Consensus rally to be even larger this year as ""attendance this year is up dramatically and it’s coming at a time when Bitcoin/Crypto is down YTD [year-to-date]."" Instead, bitcoin, ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash were seen trading with a negative bias. A few probable reasons for no bullish strength could be lack of volumes, over diversification by investors in small cap coins for quick returns, and low liquidity.  Bitcoin
Bitcoin price corrected higher during the past two sessions, but gains were limited by the USD 8,450 and USD 8,500 resistance levels. BTC/USD is currently trading flat near USD 8,250 (GMT 9:00 AM).
It seems like the price is trading in a broad range between USD 8,200 and USD 8,500. It may continue to consolidate before making the next move either towards USD 9,000 or below USD 8,000. Ethereum
Ethereum seems to be struggling to hold gains above USD 700. ETH/USD traded towards the USD 720 resistance, which prevented gains. It is currently up around 1.6% to USD 698, with an immediate resistance at USD 710 and USD 720. 
A push above USD 720 may well open the gates for a run towards USD 750. On the flip side, a break below USD 690 could ignite a fresh bearish wave towards USD 665. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash was able to stay above the USD 1,200 support and recovered more than 2% to USD 1,280. BCH/USD is currently struggling to move above USD 1,300, which is a major barrier for buyers. On the downside, supports are at USD 1,250 and USD 1,240.

In fact, the CEO of Square and Twitter has been very vocal about Bitcoin (BTC) today, saying he is a “huge fan.”  Jack Dorsey, Square, and Twitter CEO, made these comments on stage at Consensus 2018. The 41-year-old stated that the Internet is “going to have a native currency,” and that instead of waiting for it to happen, we should “help it happen.” When we do have a native currency, however, Dorsey said he doesn’t know if it will end up being BTC, but he has his fingers crossed that it will be.  Hello #Consenus2018! — jack (@jack) May 16, 2018  Dorsey also likely made these comments because using Bitcoin (BTC), or any virtual currency, for that matter, as a global currency will make it easier for his payments company to enter new marketplaces.  So, did the Bitcoin community react positively to Jack Dorsey’s comments at Consensus 2018? On Twitter, there were a number of tweets that seemed to support Dorsey’s ideas.

Bitcoin price was rejected from the USD 8,750 - USD 8,800 resistance area, resulting in a major bearish move. BTC/USD tumbled by more than USD 500 and tested the USD 8,100 support area. Altcoins market was also dragged lower as most major cryptocurrencies, including ethereum, bitcoin cash, ripple, ADA and neo posted declines between 5%-10%. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price formed a short-term top near USD 8,800 and declined sharply. BTC/USD broke many important support levels, including USD 8,500 to move into a bearish zone. The recent decline was protected by the USD 8,100 support, which acted as a barrier for sellers on many occasions. 
However, it seems like the price may not stay above the stated support for a long time. If buyers fail to hold the USD 8,100 support, bitcoin could decline below USD 8,000. On the other hand, if the price corrects higher, the previous supports at USD 8,400 and USD 8,500 are likely to prevent upsides. Ethereum
Ethereum followed bitcoin’s decline and dropped more than USD 50. More importantly, ETH/USD broke the USD 700 support and traded close to USD 670. The price is currently down 6.1% to USD 685 and it remains at a risk of more losses (GMT 9:00 AM).
An immediate support on the downside is at USD 670. Should there be a break below USD 670, the price may perhaps retest the USD 650 support. On the upside, the price has to move above USD 700 to recover in the short term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash declined sharply and broke the USD 1,300 support. BCH/USD is currently down 12.2% to USD 1,245 with a lot of bearish signs. On the downside, the USD 1,200 support awaits to protect the current decline. Resistances on the upside are at USD 1,280 and USD 1,300.
Ripple trimmed most of its gains and declined below the USD 0.70 support. It is down 8.5% to USD 0.67, with an immediate support at USD 0.65. XRP/USD may correct higher in the short term, but upsides could be capped by USD 0.70. Other Altcoins Market Today

The goal of the Bitcoin savings account is to provide investors with a fiat-based yield on their Bitcoin holdings. This is done through a simplified version of a call overwrite. All an investor needs to do is choose the implied rate they want to earn and the number of Bitcoins the yield will be applied to. Then, they just need to submit these choices to the LedgerX engine that is already powering their Bitcoin options product. The LedgerX Bitcoin savings account has two CFTC licenses. One is the derivatives clearing organization (DCO) license, and the other is a swap execution facility (SEF) license.  The Bitcoin savings account was designed based on LedgerX’s customer use patterns – but it isn’t for everyone. The product was designed to appeal to long-term Bitcoin investors, those who prefer to HODL than to sell.

According to the official press release, the payment will include services such as property taxes, driver license and ID card fees, as well as tags and titles, and will be done in either Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash. The Seminole County’s tax collector Joel M. Greenberg adds, “We live in a world where technology has made access to services on demand, with same-day delivery and the expectation of highly efficient customer service and we should expect the same from our government. The aim of my tenure in office is to make our customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st century and one way is the addition of cryptocurrency to our payment options.” The county will employ BitPay’s (a bitcoin payment service provider) services, which will allow them to receive settlement the next business day directly to its bank account in US dollars. The county aims to eliminate risks connected to credit card usage, such as fraud and identity theft, through this service.

Almost all large cap and small cap coins rallied and posted decent gains. BTC/USD was successful in holding the USD 8,300 support area and it moved above the USD 8,600 resistance. The current market sentiment is bullish, signaling more gains in bitcoin and altcoins during the coming sessions. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price formed a support above the USD 8,300 level and jumped above the USD 8,600 and USD 8,700 resistance levels. BTC/USD traded above the USD 8,850 level before trimming gains to USD 8,720.
The price is currently (GMT 8:45 AM) up around 3.5% and is placed nicely above the USD 8,600 support. It may well resume its uptrend above the USD 8,700 resistance. However, a proper break and close above the USD 9,000 resistance is required for further upsides. On the downside, USD 8,600, USD 8,500 and USD 8,450 are key support levels. Ethereum
Ethereum moved with a lot of bullish strength and surpassed a crucial hurdle at USD 700. It even traded above the USD 720 resistance and is currently up 3% to USD 730.
It seems like ETH/USD is currently consolidating above the USD 700 level and it is preparing for the next leg above USD 750. If ETH buyers succeed in pushing the price above USD 750, the next barrier awaits near USD 780. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is stable above USD 1,400, but it lacks upward momentum. BCH/USD has to stay above the USD 1,400 support, else it could decline towards USD 1,360. On the upside, it is facing resistances near the USD 1,440 and USD 1,460 levels.
Ripple moved back above the USD 0.70 support, which is a positive sign. XRP/USD is up 2% to USD 0.737 and it may continue to move higher towards the USD 0.75 resistance. Supports are at USD 0.72 and USD 0.70.  Other Altcoins Market Today

Should you really think to put your money into Bitcoin? Well, Tim Draper is an investor with renowned opinions about the cryptomarket. He is an avid believer in the positivities of crypto and his bullish position has earned him many followers and detractors. On multiple occasions, his predicted forecasts have proved successful despite adverse scenarios, and this is something to take into consideration. A few years ago, Draper predicted that Bitcoin would increase by more than 10k, a figure that only a few believed possible at the time. His prediction was met in about one year. A month ago, Mr. Draper also predicted that Bitcoin would cost 250k by 2022. Quite a controversial and yet not impossible figure compared to Bitcoin’s previous performance over time. This Thursday, in an interview for CNBC, Tim Draper spoke about the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over the traditional FIAT system. For the well-known investor, one of the most important aspects is that of security. If his opinion is to be considered once again, then it would seem that Bitcoin is safer than traditional fiat currency: “Right now, your banks are being attacked all the time. The hackers are poking holes in your banks and going after your fiat money. And the bankers are pounding away trying to keep the hacks away, but they are getting hacked all the time. No-one has ever hacked the Bitcoin blockchain. It is the most secure place to put your money. And so, as a store of value, it is a great place to be. And if you’re in Argentina or Venezuela or Nigeria, you know that your currency is going to fall 30 percent every year, because, I mean, those countries tend to implode about every year. And people lose their fortune. Well, if part of your fortune is put into bitcoin, you’re not going to lose your fortune.” This statement is true, Bitcoin has never been successfully hacked but this still doesn’t make it infallible. Is Bitcoin Safe? Perhaps there could be the use of exchanges as trusted third parties to convert digital resources into cash — just like banks? However, there have been significant hackings into large exchanges resulting in multi-million dollar losses for investors, but this risk is equally there for standard banks. Hacking though in general, is caused by faults in the internal system of the exchanges, as well as by a security failure in the banks. Can it be really be considered a flaw in the actual economic system? For this reason, it is always recommended to store cryptocurrency in a wallet (preferably a cold one) to avoid security breaches inherent in the use of third-party platforms. Mobilizing accounts to exchanges is only recommended for trading, and once finished relocating the crypto to a personal wallet is always recommended. So with that added element – an outside wallet holding your bitcoin, Its fair to say that that makes Bitcoin safer, whether or not more than fiat lies on several factors. You can’t ask “is Bitcoin safe?” without considering another vital aspect that provides security to users; the decentralized nature of crypto. This characteristic means it is out of the control of third parties such as governments or economic influencers. “If you are in Argentina or Venezuela or Nigeria, you know that your currency is going to fall 30% every year because those countries tend to implode about every year, and people lose their fortune. Well, if part of your fortune is put into Bitcoin, you’re not going to lose your fortune.” This statement is critical because in these countries inflation exceeds the Bitcoin’s price volatility. Taking Argentina as an example, the country is so incapable of paying its debt that it had to issue 100-year bonds to try to alleviate the current crisis. A similar situation exists in Venezuela, where the State has stopped issuing official figures, and the calculations are based on figures published by news sites that claim to obtain their data from social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. Some sources even estimate an inflation rate of more than 1000%. >>NYC Blockchain Week: What to expect From Consensus 2018 This Week Other reasons given by Draper for preferring the use of cryptocurrencies over the traditional FIAT system are security, effectiveness, speed, daily use and the potential for additional developments.

BTC/USD pair even broke the USD 9,000 support and tested the next support at USD 8,250. Later, it formed a base and is currently consolidating losses below USD 9,000. It may perhaps continue to trade in a range before it makes the next move. Altcoins also followed bitcoin and declined, but they are now trading in a positive zone. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently (GMT 9:00 AM)  trading flat near USD 8,400, with an immediate support at USD 8,320 followed by the all-important USD 8,250 support. BTC/USD recently traded higher, but it could not surpass a key resistance zone near USD 8,650 - USD 8,700.
The price may continue to trade in a range above USD 8,250 in the short term before the decisive move. There could be two scenarios – first, the price breaks the USD 8,250 support, drops below USD 8,000 and starts a fresh upside wave. Alternatively, the price could move higher and break the USD 8,650 - USD 8,700 resistance.
Weekly resistances are at USD 8,700 and USD 9,000. Supports are at USD 8,250, USD 8,000 and USD 7,500. Ethereum
Ethereum followed bitcoin this past week and tumbled sharply below USD 700 and USD 650. ETH/USD traded towards the USD 625 support before finding strong bids for a recovery.
The pair recovered and is currently up 4.10% to USD 708. It must stay above the USD 700 pivot level to continue moving higher. If buyers fail to keep the price above USD 700, it could retest the USD 650 support during the coming sessions. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price moved into a bearish zone below USD 1,500 this past week. BCH/USD is currently flirting with the USD 1,400 level and is down roughly 2.2%. It may rise in the short term towards USD 1,440, but a break above USD 1,500 is required for a substantial recovery this week.
Ripple is back above USD 0.70 after a major decline. XRP/USD is currently up more than 6.5% to USD 0.7240. The price is currently trading with a positive bias above USD 0.70, and it may climb further towards USD 0.80 and 0.85 during the coming days.  Other Altcoins Market Today

Roger Ver – who has earned the moniker “Bitcoin Jesus” for his advocacy of Bitcoin from the early years, believes that Bitcoin could lose its leading position in the cryptocurrency sphere. He says cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) have better technologies and are well positioned to generate substantial gains in the days to come. Ethereum coins currently trade around $700 USD with the market capitalization of $69 billion. Its price and market cap is substantially lower than Bitcoin’s price of $9,000 USD and market cap of over $149 billion. Bitcoin Cash stands at the fourth spot in cryptocurrency ranking – with its price of $1,500 and the market cap of $24 billion. Although Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash price appreciated at a faster pace than bitcoin over the last month, both coins are still standing far behind bitcoin. Roger Ver says Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash will generate massive gains in the days to come compared to Bitcoins modest gains. This movement will allow ETH and BTC to outshine BTC. He said, “I see it happening, and I believe it’s imminent,” Mr. Ver told The Independent. “Ethereum could overtake bitcoin by the end of the year, and bitcoin cash could do the same before 2020.” The Bitcoin expert further claims that the Bitcoin blockchain technology offers slower transaction times and higher fees compared to several other newer technologies. The cryptocurrency market has seen the inclusion of more than 1,500 digital coins since Bitcoin’s commencement in 2009 and each cryptocurrency technology is trying to beat Bitcoin’s flaws. >>Bitcoin Price Drops Below $9,000 He further claims that utility of Bitcoin Cash would allow it to stand at around $100,000 USD in the future.

Bitcoin price struggled to move above the USD 9,500 resistance and declined sharply. There was a sharp downside move in BTC/USD, and the pair broke the USD 9,200 and USD 9,000 support levels. It even settled below USD 9,000 and is currently down 6.2% to USD 8,765 (GMT 9:00). 
The price is clearly trading with a negative sentiment and it may perhaps continue to move down towards USD 8,500. On the upside, the previous support levels at USD 9,000 and USD 9,200 are likely to act as resistances if the price corrects higher. Ethereum
Ethereum also declined sharply and tumbled below the USD 720 and USD 700 support levels. ETH/USD is currently down 8.9% to USD 695, with the next support at USD 680.

This explosion in price could happen due to crypto mining, as Fundstrat predicts a growth of 350% in hash power (the processing power of the Bitcoin network) through 2019. Sam Doctor, head of data science research at Fundstrat, said in a report that the current path of hash power growth supports the forecast. According to CNBC, during a conference call, Doctor said that the economics of Bitcoin mining likely create a support level for the cryptocurrency, as Bitcoin miners are more likely to hold as the price falls to make up for operating costs, so they sell when the price rises for greater profits: “The primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors.” “The release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex [capital expenditure] as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC price appreciates,” Doctor said.

The idea of the network is that transacting and settling would be done off-blockchain, so the fees are low and thanks to the implementation of smart contracts for security, the payments can be instant - no waiting time for block confirmation. Also, another important factor is its scalability, which is supposed to make it possible for millions to billions of transactions per second to take place across the network.  Once the initial infrastructure components are complete, a Day in the life of Carol, or a new user of Lightning, would start with installing the Lightning app on her phone. Then Carol sets it up like she would a Bitcoin wallet, writing down a backup seed password that will allow her to retrieve her money should she lose her phone. Then, she sends herself some Bitcoin from an exchange using a QR code from the app. As she waits for the initial deposit to clear, her app is synchronizing with the Neutrino protocol that allows low-power devices, in our case smartphones, to use Bitcoin with a high degree of privacy and security. Afterwards, Autopilot system moves Carol’s money to the Lightning network - another waiting time of about an hour, that happens only the first time.

Bitcoin price is currently down 2.8% to USD 9,130 (GMT 9:00) and is struggling to move above the USD 9,200 resistance. Above the USD 9,200 resistance, the next immediate resistance is at USD 9,250. An hourly close above USD 9,250 may perhaps decrease the current bearish pressure and the price might recover towards USD 9,500.
On the downside, the USD 9,000 level is a crucial support. Should buyers fail to hold bitcoin price above USD 9,000, there could be another round of heavy selling in the short term. Ethereum
Ethereum trimmed most of its gains and declined by more than 4% to USD 725. ETH/USD just managed to hold the USD 700 support, which is also the last line of defense. 
On the upside, the price is facing hurdles near USD 740. Therefore, a convincing push above USD 740 may open the doors for further upsides towards the USD 760 and USD 780 levels. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash moved below the USD 1,600 support to post more than 7% losses. BCH/USD is currently trading near the USD 1,520 level, with an immediate support at USD 1,500. On the upside, the previous support at USD 1,580 may perhaps act as a resistance.

Not only content with that, Ver decided to list the real BTC under the name Bitcoin Core, when Bitcoin Core is the name of the famous Satoshi Client and the original bitcoin wallet.   Because of actions like these, users disapproved of the way BCH adopters promoted the currency. As a result of the complaints, Bitcoin.com listed BCH as Bitcoin Cash and BTC as Bitcoin again on some parts of its website. However, four days ago when Twitter account @bitcoin called BTC “an experimental coin with no whitepaper”, it was the straw that broke the camel’s back, provoking reactions from important personalities like Mike Novogratz who responded in a very heated tone: Bitcoin Cash is the oldest cryptocurrency. Its white paper was published in 2008 and the genesis block mined in January 2009.  Bitcoin Core (BTC) is an experimental currency that does not have a white paper and has only operated under its current model for two years. pic.twitter.com/YBeepJlwC5 — Bitcoin (@Bitcoin) May 4, 2018  As a result of the Bitcoin.com controversy, Coinmarketcap, one of the reference sites when researching the status and characteristics of cryptos around the world, decided to remove Bitcoin.com from the list of official Bitcoin websites.  This was inevitable. Bitcoin.com is possibly the number one searched domain name when looking for information regarding Bitcoin – even more than bitcoin.org which is now the only official website. The kind of controversy that Bitcoin.com is stirring up means it doesn’t hold a neutral position regarding cryptos. This seems to warrant its removal from one of the worlds biggest crypto related platforms.  >>The New York Stock Exchange Has its Eyes on Trading Bitcoin Another reference website – CoinCall, listed BCH as the “shitcoin with the most market cap. The reasons for such a decision are explained on a popup: “intentionally misleading newcomers to believe it’s the ‘real’ Bitcoin, for example by misusing bitcoin.com and the @bitcoin Twitter handle.”  So far there have been no comments from Roger Ver or the bitcoin.com team. It is quite obvious that the Bitcoin.com controversy has ruffled industry feathers. However, it is important to note that Bitcoin.com is still one of the official forums for the most popular cryptocurrency on the market.

The New York Times reported late Monday that the plans are still ‘confidential’ and the four individuals that briefed the publication on the matter asked to remain anonymous. This news broke following Goldman Sachs’ grand announcement to be the first Wall Street bank to open up its own Bitcoin trading unit.

Nasdaq partnered with the large cryptocurrency exchange Gemini just a few weeks ago, to get its foot in the Bitcoin futures game. Even the long-time anti-Bitcoin bank JPMorgan has turned a new leaf. Back in October of last year,  the institution filed for a patent to use blockchain technology in its network payments. These moves mark a dramatic shift toward mainstream adoption for the digital currency. >> Goldman Sachs Bitcoin Futures Swap Contracts The NYSE-parent recently held various conversations with large US financial institutions about potential ‘swap’ contracts. In a swap, banks would buy a contract that would give one of its customer’s Bitcoin the very next day. According to the individuals working on the project with ICE, these contracts would be backed and secured by the exchange. While these swap contracts may seem more complex than just trading USD for BTC on an exchange like the rest of us; these particular trades come under the regulation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The swap trades operate clearly under the current laws, something exchanges have yet to do. Adena Friedman, CEO of NASDAQ, recently said her company would create a cryptocurrency exchange if the regulatory issues were ironed out by the U.S govt. What do you think about the latest news?

Tyler Winklevoss, early Bitcoin investor and co-founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, did not pass up the opportunity to tell him how to do it exactly. “Dear @BillGates there is an easy way to short bitcoin. You can short #XBT, the @CBOE Bitcoin (USD) Futures contract, and put your money where your mouth is!” tweeted the young entrepreneur on Monday afternoon. Futures let traders bet on the price of an asset, in this case Bitcoin, at a point months later. A trader who sells a futures contract in anticipation of a decline in Bitcoin price makes money if the price does drop. Trading to benefit from a decline is known as shorting. The rest of the community spoke out as well. To his “greater fool theory” comment, Reddit user billbacon commented, “At least that’s a step up from tulips,” referencing how analysts often compare Bitcoin to the infamous tulip bubble.  Another user, tldrtldrtldr says that Gates actually shorting Bitcoin may not be a bad thing either: “Shorting is great for true price discovery. By all means he should short it. If Bitcoin has legs it will rise. If it fails, it was a bubble all along. Let the market settle this.”",-146.0500000000011,0

It is consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the introduction of futures markets for an asset,” four researchers wrote in the bank's most recent Economic Letter. They add that until futures existed it was extremely difficult, if not impossible, to bet on the decline of Bitcoin prices. The cryptocurrency rose more than 1,300% in 2017 as optimistic investors continued to bid up. “The pessimists, however, had no mechanism available to put money behind their belief that the bitcoin price would collapse. So they were left to wait for their “I told you so” moment,” the researchers explain. As for why it was a gradual fall rather than an overnight collapse, researchers said it could be a lack of attention or willingness to enter the market on the first week of trading. Future prices and demand could be helped by any traditional financial institutions becoming more willing to accept Bitcoin, and official recognition and regulatory acceptance of Bitcoin as a means of payments, they wrote. Once speculative demand by optimists and pessimists balances out, the research offers some insights into where the fundamental price of Bitcoin could go. “Given that there is no actual asset that backs the value of Bitcoin [...] what will eventually determine the “fundamental” price of Bitcoin is transactional demand relative to supply,” explains the text. Until then, the price is most likely to remain its old volatile self. Futures contracts, also referred to as futures, are standardized exchange-traded financial derivatives that provide an agreement between a buyer and a seller to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a predefined date. Each futures contract represents a specific amount of the underlying asset and futures can be either cash settled or come with physical delivery. In the case of bitcoin futures, the underlying asset is the digital currency bitcoin.",-146.0500000000011,0

BTC/USD buyers successfully defended the USD 9,200 support, and ethereum stayed above the USD 700 handle. Later, the crypto market sentiment improved and prices recovered above key resistance levels. Technically, it seems like a correction wave is complete and prices may resume its uptrend. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently trading 0.45% up to USD 9,400 (around GMT 9:00 AM). To gain upside momentum, BTC/USD has to move above the USD 9,600 resistance level. Should buyers succeed in clearing the USD 9,600 resistance, the next stop could be the all-important USD 10,000.
On the flip side, if the price moves down once again, the USD 9,200 support may perhaps prevent losses. Below this the price might test the USD 9,000 level.
In the short-term, the price may trade in a range below USD 9,600 before making the next move. Ethereum
Ethereum bounced back sharply from the USD 700 barrier. ETH/USD traded above the USD 750 resistance and is currently trading 1.78% higher to USD 758. 
The price is facing resistance near the USD 770 level. A successful break above the stated resistance will most likely push the price above USD 800. On the downside, supports are visible near USD 750 and USD 740. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash was well bid around the USD 1,550 support. BCH/USD recovered nicely and moved above the USD 1,600 resistance. On the upside, a break above the USD 1,680 resistance is required for a push towards the USD 1,750 level.
Ripple stayed above the USD 0.82 support and is currently up 1% to USD 0.8320. XRP/USD is facing a tough resistance at USD 0.85, which prevented gains on many occasions earlier. Above USD 0.85, the price could retest the USD 0.90 level. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, Bytecoin got heavily bid after it was listed on one of the major cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. BCN price jumped by more than 100% and traded above USD 0.014.  A few other small cap altcoins such as 0x, ZIL, Ethos, Loom Network, Holo, Pundi X and Cortex gained more than 10% today.

According to people who wished to remain anonymous due to the plans still being confidential, as well as documents and emails seen by NYT, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been working on an online trading platform for large investors to buy and hold (or HODL) Bitcoin. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE, the parent company of the NY Stock Exchange) and Goldman mark the first foray into the as of yet unregulated world of cryptocurrency. Since details of the ICE platform are still not finalized, there is a chance that the project could fall apart, given the reluctance usually shown by the Wall Street in terms of crypto. The New York Times further reports ICE having had conversations with financial institutions about implementing so-called swaps, which mean banks buying contracts that end with a customer owning Bitcoin the next day, citing people familiar with the matter. Although the swap is slightly more complicated than simply buying crypto for an amount of USD, it would allow the trading to come under the regulation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, operating under existing laws. The possible move would fall in line with the general trend of increasing warmth towards the crypto industry: only recently, the CEO of Nasdaq said the company could become a crypto exchange as well as soon as the industry matures.

In an interview for The Express Mr. Greenspan mentioned that technical analysis better explains the reasons for the fall in Bitcoin prices than fundamental analysis. “I believe that more than fear of regulation that decline from the 20,000 peak was more of just a normal retracement.” Mr. Greenspan is a fervent advocate that markets move in trends and cycles, so a behavior as bullish as that seen during the last quarter of 2017 could only have a subsequent bearish after-effect. For him, this type of “retracement” had already occurred on previous occasions, to give rise to a greater bullish impulse later: “Whenever the price moves and jumps into a new order of magnitude, we need to see some sort of retracement on that. It’s the same thing that when it jumped up from eight cents to $3.50, then it had a retracement back to a dollar, that’s a very normal thing after that kind of leap. So if we look at it now, I believe we are about five or six percent up over the price a year ago.“ For Greenspan, expectations are very high. According to his comparisons, Bitcoin is in a better position today than in previous years, which “without a doubt” implies a reasonable probability that bitcoin will beat last year’s all-time high. According to technical analyses, bitcoin is showing a breakdown of what is known as a “triangle pattern” – a market behavior in which dips get higher up and peaks get lower and lower.   Analysts define the triangle pattern as a search for equilibrium, meaning that when this figure is broken, or when the apex is reached, the path taken represents a strong future trend. In the case of Bitcoin, it is clear that that the market’s behavior broke the triangle on an upward path. This could be a good start towards fulfilling the forecasts of Mr. Greenspan, who, despite his bullish statements, did not cease to be conservative, saying “I don’t know what’s going to happen in the future.

He explains, “Bitcoin and ICOs [initial coin offerings], I believe completely [they're some] of the crazier, speculative things.” Of course, he’s not too far off from most negative opinions regarding Bitcoin, and similarly, he believes in blockchain as a technology and can see how it could be implemented.

BTC/USD traded above the USD 9,500 resistance and even broke the USD 10,000 level. However, buyers could not hold the momentum above the USD 10,000 level, resulting in a downside reaction. At the outset, the current price action suggests that buyers are losing grip. Therefore, there could be more declines in bitcoin and altcoins before the start of a fresh upside wave. Bitcoin
Today’s technical indicators are pointing a bearish price action in Bitcoin. BTC/USD has trimmed more than USD 500 and is currently trading near USD 9,400 (GMT 9:00 AM). On the upside, resistances are at USD 9,500 and USD 9,600.
A successful close above the USD 9,600 resistance may perhaps push the price towards the all-important USD 10,000. Finally, a proper close above USD 10,000 is a must for bullish continuation.
On the downside, the previous resistance near USD 9,250 is a key support. If the price fails to hold the USD 9,250 support, there could be more losses. Weekly supports below USD 9,250 are USD 9,000 and 8,450. Ethereum
Ethereum trimmed more than 10% of its last week gains. ETH/USD declined from well above USD 830 to USD 730. At present, the price is down 4.9% to USD 740 with bearish signs. Weekly supports on the downside are at USD 720 and USD 700. 
On the flip side, if the price moves higher, it could face sellers near USD 760. Above this last, the main weekly resistances are at USD 800 and USD 830. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash declined more than USD 200 from the USD 1,850 high. BCH/USD is currently under a bearish pressure and is trading above the USD 1,600 support. A break below the USD 1,600 support may perhaps push the price towards USD 1,500.
Ripple trimmed most of its last week gains and settled below USD 0.90 and USD 0.85. XRP/USD is now approaching the USD 0.80 support where buyers are likely to appear.  Other Altcoins Market Today
Most small cap altcoins enjoyed solid gains this past week. However, it seems like they are losing momentum and are at risk of more declines. Today’s best performer is BitcoinDark, which surged by more than 40% and traded towards USD 175.

The time, the Oracle of Omaha was speaking at the annual Berkshire Hathaway, an American multinational conglomerate holding company, run by Buffett, shareholder meeting on Saturday. One of the theories that seems to hold most merit is that Buffett’s obvious distaste for all things related to cryptocurrency is based in fear: among Berkshire Hathaway's biggest holdings are traditional financial institutions such as Wells Fargo (the largest by far), Goldman Sachs or Bank of New York Mellon. As the Redditor et-nad who first pointed this out puts it, “His firm will collapse if he started supporting crypto. Not surprised.” Buffett’s words should not be taken as scripture in the cryptoverse, and his support, or lack thereof, is not hindering the adoption of crypto all that much, according to other Redditors who had joined the discussion. “Buffet likes slow, steady, stable, proven industries that produce small but consistent returns. Crypto definitely doesn't fit into any of the above categories,” says one. Another points out that his loud hatred is perhaps unwarranted: “I like red sauce pasta. It doesn't mean I should go bashing white sauce pasta,” comparing it to Buffett’s general reactions. Another replied, “Go take your reasonable, well-adjusted outlook on life elsewhere. Your kind isn't welcomed here.” Buffett has a history of being wrong about new technologies: only recently, he admitted he was wrong about both Google and Amazon, having expressed his disbelief in the companies when they first emerged. In either case, Berkshire Hathaway keeps growing. Its revenues stood at USD 242 billion last year, or 8% more than in 2016. While it assets increased by 13%, to USD 702.1 billion, in the same period, according to the annual report of the company.",-272.65999999999985,0

However, Bitcoin.com has since corrected their mistake, adding the “Cash” part to BCH, while still naming BTC as ""Bitcoin Core"". Twitter user MoneyTrigz, who originally launched the idea of the lawsuit, tweeted, “We appreciate the 31 people that donated to the initiative. But USD 3,700 won't be enough to do much, so we decided to cancel the initiative and refund the 31 transactions (total 0.39BTC). I’m happy were able to at least get bitcoin.com make 90% changes on its fraud and disinformation.” Charlie Lee, founder of Litecoin cryptocurrency, called the lawsuit “stupid” at first, but retracted his statement in a tweet, saying that the lawsuit has obviously “done some good” by making Roger Ver, the creator of bitcoin.com, correct the erroneous claims made on his website. The group’s response to the decision to pull the lawsuit has been largely positive, with one user saying it was “the first time Roger [Ver] scaled back on his fraudulent practices.” The civil war between BTC and BCH will presumably keep raging, although it often boils down to fans of both picking petty fights. However, this move should not be seen as a loss for BCH: if anything, it is a help to crypto rookies to not make mistakes because of Bitcoin confusion. As a certain videogame would say, “War. War never changes.”",5.260000000000218,1

BTC/USD cleared a major resistance at USD 9,500 to move further in the bullish zone. Similarly, Ethereum cleared the USD 780 - USD 800 barrier to register more than 10% gains. Overall, the current technical structure is bullish, which could result in more upsides in bitcoin and altcoins. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is rising steadily and is up around 6.4% to USD 9,820 (~GMT 9:00 AM). BTC/USD settled above a major resistance at USD 9,500, opening the doors for a test of USD 10,000. Should buyers succeed in clearing the USD 10,000 hurdle, the price could accelerate gains in the near term. The next resistance is close to the USD 10,800 level.
If there is a correction from the current or higher levels, the previous resistance at USD 9,500 is likely to act as a support. Below the stated USD 9,500, the next major support is at USD 9,200. Ethereum
Ethereum gained more than 10% today and is currently flirting with the USD 800 resistance. A successful close above the stated resistance may perhaps call for further upsides towards the USD 840 level.
On the downside, there are many support for ETH/USD, starting with USD 780 and up to USD 750. The pair remains well supported on dips and it seems like buyers are in control above USD 780. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is struggling to catch up and is currently up around 2.8% to USD 1,520. BCH/USD broke the USD 1,500 resistance, which is a positive sign. However, the price has to gain momentum to continue towards USD 1,540. On the downside, the USD 1,500 and USD 1,480 are support levels.
Ripple traded higher and broke the USD 0.90 resistance. XRP/USD is now back in a bullish zone and it could continue to rise towards the USD 1.00 level during the following sessions. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins traded higher today, including Loom, Decred, ETN, Nano, KCS, Komodo and Augur.  The current market sentiment is bullish for bitcoin and altcoins. If BTC succeeds in clearing the USD 10,000 hurdle today, there could be heavy gains in the crypto market.",5.260000000000218,1

Now, however, it appears bitcoin may be returning to the platform. This isn’t speculation, either; the Reddit chief technology officer confirmed the news of bitcoin payments returning to Reddit.  On Thursday, Chris Slowe, Reddit’s CTO, announced in an interview that the site is planning to reinstate bitcoin as a form of payment. This option will be available to the platform’s gold members. There’s more, though. Slowe went on to say that Reddit is not just looking solely at BTC, but rather it is looking at adding more than one crypto payment option.  The other coins Reddit is looking at are Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC). Ethereum (ETH) is currently selling for $746.09, putting the coin up 9.71% in the past twenty-four hours.  Source: CoinMarketCap Meanwhile, Litecoin is also in the green, currently selling for $160.42. This puts the coin up 7.82% in the past twenty-four hours.   Source: CoinMarketCap Aside from a spike in transaction fees, Reddit has also cited the reason for the site stopping the bitcoin option to be because of its integration issue with Coinbase (Reddit’s crypto payments processor). Back in March, Coinbase turned off its Merchant Tool and replaced it with a Coinbase Commerce product. This is reportedly one of the reasons that ultimately led to the halt. The news is circulating around the Twitter universe, which suggests people are excited about bitcoin’s return. One crypto analyst even tweeted that this is an indication that the cryptovirus is spreading, writing “internet money for the win.” Others questioned the point, stating that we don’t know whether or not the fees will rise again (like they did in December) once people start using bitcoin heavily again. In response to the latter point, people reminded the user that Segwit was not implemented in December in the way that it is now. >>Goldman Sachs Launching Bitcoin Futures Contracts Soon What do you think of the news?

Goldman Sachs launching Bitcoin futures contracts is a pretty big deal for the financial world. What made the investment firm take the plunge? New York Times reporter Nathaniel Popper wrote that Goldman Sachs plans to use its own money to trade Bitcoin futures contracts for its clients. The investment firm will also offer its clients its very own bitcoin futures products. “[Goldman Sachs] will also create its own, more flexible version of a future, known as a non-deliverable forward, which it will offer to clients,” continued Popper. An exact date has yet to be set, but Goldman Sachs said it will likely be occurring within the next few weeks. >> Bitcoin Hashrate Nears All-Time High Despite Market Skepticism Goldman Sachs isn’t the first big gun to launch a Bitcoin futures service. Back in December, Cboe Global Markets and CME Group both launched Bitcoin futures trading, on December 10th and December 17th respectively. Although both launches were a resounding success, the Bitcoin futures trading may have also, in part, led to the subsequent Bitcoin crash shortly after. Bitcoin has yet to fully recover from its crash, the coin now selling at $9,416.12 according to CoinMarketCap data (which is approximately $10,000 below its all-time high selling price achieved on December 17th). So why does Goldman Sachs want to get in on the Bitcoin futures action? One of the Goldman executives in charge of creating the futures operation, Rana Yared, told New York Times that “the bank had received inquiries from hedge funds, as well as endowments and foundations that received virtual currency donations from newly minted bitcoin millionaires and didn’t know how to handle them.” Yared continued, “It resonates with us when a client says, ‘I want to hold bitcoin or bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate store of value.'” Evidently, there were quite a few clients who felt this and so, ultimately, the decision to start Bitcoin futures contracts was approved by the Goldman board of directors. What effect do you think Goldman Sachs launching Bitcoin futures contracts will have on the market? Will it help to move Bitcoin’s price up?

In his opinion, the blockchain is a “glorified Excel spreadsheet” since “cryptocurrency holders still go through centralized exchanges to clear their transactions.” Alex Mashinsky, a blockchain entrepreneur, told him, “Everything you just said is irrelevant.” Voicing the general confusion, Bill Barhydt, who worked on cryptography for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) said, “I don’t even know where to begin.” Mashinsky stepped up to the Captain Crypto role to defend the valiant cryptoverse, saying crypto assets will let people bypass banks, to which Dr Doom replied, “You’re just making stuff up.” It would seem Dr Doom was not informed that sticking your fingers in your ears and shouting lalala does not change reality when you’re above six years old. Mashinsky wasn’t backing down. “Why don’t you buy one coin, then you can tell us how it works,” he slammed the “evil” Dr Doom down. According to New York Post, Barhydt said of Roubini that this is, “like a horse salesman saying we don’t need combustion engines.” Although many in the crypto space may seem younglings compared to all panelists, we feel compelled to tell you: this is not how grownups talk. Or they do?",509.89000000000124,1

While the exact launch date of the new trading operation is not yet set, the move came after the bank's board of directors signed off on the initiative. Although Goldman will not immediately be buying and selling Bitcoin, a team at the bank is reported to be willing to go into that direction following regulatory approval, as well as having a plan on how to deal with the associated risks. One of the Goldman executives overseeing the creation of the trading operation, Rana Yared, said the decision resulted from a growing number of inquiries from clients who expressed their interest in holding (or HODLing) Bitcoin. “It resonates with us when a client says, ‘I want to hold Bitcoin or Bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate store of value,’” she told the Times. She adds that Goldman had concluded that Bitcoin is not a fraud and does not have the characteristics of a currency. They also intend on creating their own future, described as more flexible, known as a non-deliverable forward, which they will offer to clients. They have also hired their own first “digital asset” trader, Justin Schmidt, to handle the daily operation. Schmidt previously worked as a trader at hedge fund Seven Eight Capital before leaving last year to trade cryptocurrencies. Futures contracts, also referred to as futures, are standardized exchange-traded financial derivatives that provide an agreement between a buyer and a seller to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a predefined date. Each futures contract represents a specific amount of the underlying asset and futures can be either cash settled or come with physical delivery. In the case of bitcoin futures, the underlying asset is the digital currency bitcoin.

Bitcoin price broke the USD 8,000 and USD 8,500 resistance levels to settle above USD 9,000. However, volatility dipped sharply during the past few months. Per Bloomberg, Bitcoin’s daily trading range fell from USD 4,700 in December 2017 to USD 124 in April 2018. Such narrow ranges were seen during mid-2017 before BTC/USD jumped from USD 2,000 towards USD 20,000. The current technical structure, narrow range trading, candlestick patterns on the daily chart and multiple rejection patterns from the lows indicates that bitcoin price is heading towards a major break. It could surge higher if buyers succeed in pushing the price above the USD 10,000 resistance level. Therefore, the next few weeks may perhaps play a crucial role. Bitcoin
Considering intraday price action, bitcoin price was successful in surpassing the USD 9,250 resistance. It has opened the doors for more gains, which means BTC/USD could accelerate higher towards USD 9,500 and USD 9,600 during the following sessions.
On the downside, supports are seen at USD 9,100, USD 9,050 and USD 9,000. Any further declines could be limited considering the current positive bias. Ethereum
Ethereum once again performed well and broke the USD 700 resistance. ETH/USD traded to a new monthly high above USD 730, and it seems like the pair is likely to continue its upside move.
If there is a downside correction, the broken resistance levels at USD 700 and USD 690 are likely to act as supports in the near term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash broke a crucial resistance at USD 1,400, which opened the doors for a push above USD 1,500. BCH/USD traded as high as USD 1,540 today before correcting to USD 1,480. On the downside, supports are at USD 1,450 and USD 1,400.
Ripple is trading flat near the USD 0.85 level. XRP/USD is facing a lot of hurdles on the upside, and it is struggling to move above the USD 0.90 resistance zone. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, two small cap altcoins, Golem and Hshare registered heavy gains. Both are trading higher by more than 40% to USD 0.80 and 16 respectively. GNT price is showing a bullish formation and it could test the USD 1.00 resistance. A few other coins, such as Bytecoin, Fusion, Loom Network, VERI and 0x registered around 20% gains.

Bitcoin price moved back above USD 9,000 and ETH/USD bounced back sharply to trade close USD 680. The technical structure suggests that BTC and ETH are likely to surge higher and trade to fresh monthly highs during the coming sessions. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price recovered and traded above the USD 9,000 pivot level. BTC/USD is currently trading 0.5% up to USD 9,090 and it seems like the price may accelerate higher. 
On the upside, there are two important resistances – USD 9,200 and USD 9,250. A close above the USD 9,250 resistance could open the doors for a push towards the USD 9,500 level in the near term.
If there is a downside correction, the price may find bids near USD 9,000, followed by the USD 8,800 swing low. Ethereum
Ethereum performed really well and recovered above the USD 650 and USD 670 resistance levels. More importantly, the ETH/USD pair formed a solid bullish pattern on the daily chart, signaling a rejection from the USD 625 level.
On the upside, the price is facing resistance near USD 680. Should the price clear the stated USD 780, it could accelerate above the USD 700 level.  Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is up around 2.1% to USD 1,352. BCH/USD is showing positive signs above the USD 1,320 support, but it has to break the USD 1,380 and USD 1,400 resistance levels to remain in a positive zone. A proper close above USD 1,400 may perhaps push the price towards USD 1,500.
Ripple moved up by more than 2.5% and broke the USD 0.85 resistance. It seems like the XRP/USD pair continue to move higher towards the next hurdle at USD 0.90 in the near term. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, Loom Network surged by more than 40% and traded above USD 0.40. A major cryptocurrency exchange, Binance listed LOOM, which ignited a rally.  Moreover, there were many small cap coins, which registered more than 10% gains today, such as ReddCoin, Stratis, BAT, Syscoin, Fusion and NXT.

Gox Trustee, in a move that took an increasingly optimistic Bitcoin community by surprise. The move triggered some nervousness because a previous similar course of actions by the man known as “The Tokyo Bitcoin Whale” (the selling of 400M$ in BTC) was pointed as the cause of a bearish streak that ended with a fall in BTC prices of almost 40%. With similar precedent, negative opinions did not take long, including several media outlets rushing to sell the news, publishing a negative sentiments shared by some technical analysts. The correlation seemed obvious, so the results were to be expected. However, it is important to note that Mr. Nobuaki had previously talked about the situation, clearing up the doubts of many investors who practically blamed him for a global collapse: “Following consultation with cryptocurrency experts, I sold BTC and BCH, not by an ordinary sale through the BTC/BCH exchange, but in a manner that would avoid affecting the market price, while ensuring the security of the transaction to the extent possible,” Despite the series of massive sales that took place, the Bitcoin market remained stable, with a steady and relatively bullish trend holding it at around $9,000. Nervousness and volatility could not reverse market sentiment, which this time did not buy the news.  The reason seems to be the same one previously overlooked by analysts. Apparently, Mr. Nobuaki’s sales were made OTC, i.e., they are not reflected in the charts as they are made in batches and in a personal way, and not through intermediaries as is usual in traditional trading exercises. Trading over the counter is a less popular form of trading in which no trading records are produced. The parties personally buy, negotiate and sell crypto to avoid regulations, price deviations and any other type of alterations and barriers typical of traditional trade. Kevin Zhou, the founder of cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund Galois Capital, told Reuters that this is the ideal way to carry out large-scale operations like Mr. Nobuaki’s: “Generally, you would go trade through an OTC desk when you have a large block trade you want to do without moving the market too much or incurring too much slippage” This strategy is logical. In theory, Mr. Nobuaki could sell all his tokens at a certain price immediately without going through the “market sell” processes that would exhaust the buy orders causing a considerable drop in Bitcoin prices. The market remains calm; apparently, the period of nervousness has passed, and the bullish are gaining ground, especially in candles reflecting behaviors over the one day span, which leads to the conclusion that there is strong confidence in the behavior of BTC prices.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Buffett still isn’t jumping on the crypto train. Buffett told Yahoo Finance that he doesn’t see Bitcoin as an investment. Instead, he believes it’s a gamble. He continued to explain that there isn’t anything wrong with that, per say, but that it’s important not to treat Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as anything more than a game. You can’t expect it to behave like an investment, because it isn’t an investment. Buffett explained: “If you buy something like a farm, an apartment house, or an interest in a business… You can do that on a private basis… And it’s a perfectly satisfactory investment. You look at the investment itself to deliver the return to you. Now, if you buy something like bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don’t really have anything that has produced anything. You’re just hoping the next guy pays more.” He continued to explain that “You aren’t investing when you do that. You’re speculating. There’s nothing wrong with it. If you wanna gamble somebody else will come along and pay more money tomorrow, that’s one kind of game. That is not investing.” Buffett’s stance on Bitcoin shouldn’t come as a huge surprise given his previous thoughts on the coin. >> Fundstrat Poll Shows Investors Believe in Bitcoin In 2014, Buffett likened Bitcoin to that of a mirage. He also compared Bitcoin to cheques: they’re both just ways of transmitting money. At the time he said that Bitcoin shouldn’t hold value because there were a number of ways money could be transmitted. Despite the advancements in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through the years, Buffett has little changed his tune. In January of this year, Buffett told CNBC that cryptocurrencies “will come to a bad ending.” Buffett is a crypto bear that never plans on buying Bitcoin. Do you agree with Warren Buffett on Bitcoin?

The problem lies in the site using the name Bitcoin for BCH and Bitcoin Core for BTC. The outraged users have now launched a site, bitcoincomlawsuit.info, which will soon be accepting Bitcoin donations in support of leveling a promised lawsuit against Bitcoin.com. Blurring the distinction between BCH and BTC has caused people to purchase BCH instead of BTC like they wanted, users claim, calling this a “fraud” and naming that as the basis for the lawsuit. Notably, the creator of bitcoin.com is Roger Ver, a long-standing proponent of Bitcoin Cash, who is well-known and often controversial for his stance that Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin. As previously written in our short primer on this war, some skeptics see this battle as a harbinger of the 'crash' that everyone who has not bought into crypto yet is waiting for. This war, shortly summarized as Roger Ver against the world, is nothing new: a while ago, he offered social media site Reddit USD 100,000 if they appoint a new moderator to the popular subreddit r/Bitcoin “who supports free speech.” But as a user pointed out, “Speech isn’t free if you pay USD 100,000 for it.” His antics have even forced Erik Voorhees, CEO of ShapeShift, a digital assets trading company, to come forward with his opinion on this feud, tweeting: Roger - please stop referencing me to back up your opinion that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.

Gox, moved BTC 16,000 (USD 147m) and a similar amount in Bitcoin Cash to an unknown address. Should Mt. Gox trustees move to sell more of the company’s huge cryptocurrency holdings, markets everywhere could be in for a tumultuous end to the week. Last time Mt. Gox sold some USD 400-500 million in Bitcoin, to cover the exchange’s yen debts, trustees were criticized as markets in multiple currencies nosedived. News outlet The Next Web quotes cryptocurrency analyst Ivo Jonkers as saying, “It appears that the Mt. Gox trustees have moved the funds to a wallet belonging to an exchange desk. The last time this happened, Mt. Gox proceeded to sell the funds at market rate, practically sending the entire market in the red. I wouldn't be surprised if this happens again.” South Korean media outlet Blockinpress claims it is “highly likely that [Kobayashi] will seek to sell the currency through exchanges with over-the-counter (OTC) transactions.” A court ruling that would appear to preventing the further sale of Mt. Gox’s crypto assets until September this year is in place, but it is unclear as to whether this would actually prevent Kobayashi from making a sale. Kobayashi claimed in March that the trustee’s previous asset sales have been measured, saying, “Following consultation with cryptocurrency experts, I sold BTC and Bitcoin Cash, not in an ordinary sale through a BTC or BCH exchange, but in a manner that would avoid affecting the market price, while ensuring the security of the transaction to the [greatest possible extent].”",-303.5799999999999,0

This is even true of the economists and the pollsters. One has to take all of these with a seriously large grain of salt and healthy suspicion as the predictions are only just that and not necessarily reality. I only need to point you to the 2016 US presidential elections to show you how wrong the pollster prophets were. They still seemed to not have recovered from their bad polling.  So with Bitcoin, we will look at some of the price predictions and other predictions that may or may not be accurate. Part of the issue is that this technology is still on the low side of the bell curve of global acceptance. So basically, the herd has not caught onto it just yet.  Just to put a little perspective on this short article, it is going on the last full week of April 2018 at the time of this report. Looking at CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is priced at $8,879. Keep that in mind as we look at a few predictions for 2018 regarding Bitcoin.  Standpoint Research under Ronnie Moas has predicted Bitcoin to be at $20,000 per coin by the end of November 2018. This is doable, based on the understanding that the stock market is overpriced and the USD is devaluing globally. Of course, the tax cuts in the United States opening up growth in the American economy may not have been a factor that was considered, which could slow down the devaluing of the USD.  Mike Novogratz is calling for Bitcoin to reach $40,000 by the end of 2018. Mike is a serious investor in this space and has been investing in ICO. So his insight is valuable. It is based on a strong belief that institutional investors are poised to invest heavily in Bitcoin. This will pour a lot of needed capital into this technology and will be the vehicle to bring the price per bitcoin up substantially.  McAfee has predicted the wildest and craziest at $1 Million by the end of 2020. Maybe he was talking about Bitcoin Cash, we are not sure. Either way, that is quite a prediction and would be very cool if that happens.  As far as the number of holders of Cryptocurrencies, that number has been predicted to go up to approximately 50 million investors by the end of 2018. This is a global prediction by Yonatan Sela of Props. This would be the beginning of the wave of herd investors as this digital currency gains momentum.  The ability for the marketplace to see Bitcoin as a means of commerce rather than just a place to acquire an asset seems to be taking hold in 2018. It is not widespread that businesses will accept Bitcoin for example as a means of payment, but the prediction in 2018 is that it is trending. One of the craziest predictions we saw for 2018 is that Bitcoin will have increased use among online gambling to the point of even having short-term volatility insurance. So these are just a few of the wild predictions around Bitcoin for 2018. It is not just about price, it is about the number of investors going up, and the trend to have Bitcoin as the means of payment for more and more services, including gambling.  This is just a short list and we recommend that you look at Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in the following manner. Do not get too emotional about it. Just look at it as an asset to invest in, with the possibility that it will be a means of commerce in the future. Consider investing in Bitcoins or other digital currency after at least a minimal education on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency in general. Start out small with some discretionary, I can afford to lose it money and build from there. Remember that diversification of your investable assets is a truth that does not go away no matter what new assets or currencies come into existence. >> Check out CCN’s daily Bitcoin Price analysis here Featured Image: DepositPhotos/ albund",414.1900000000005,1

He was on a Skype call with participants of Crypto Capital World, a crypto investments conference, currently taking place in Vilnius, Lithuania. Earlier in April, Draper estimated that bitcoin will hit USD 250,000 within four years. Now he explained why.  According to the investor, there are trillions of US dollars worth of fiat currencies and in a few years cryptocurrency share will reach at least 20%, while bitcoin's share of the crypto universe's market value will stand at 20%-25%. Also, Draper added that the ""greatest engineers"" are now working on cryptocurrencies, while ""not many engineers"" are working on improvements of US Dollar or Japanese Yen. In 2014, he correctly predicted that bitcoin would pass USD 10,000 mark in 2017. Now the investor explains that back then he estimated that bitcoin would become recognizable by many people, while growing number of available trading platforms would encourage newcomers to buy bitcoin. “This [Bitcoin] is bigger than the internet. It's bigger than the Iron Age, the Renaissance. It's bigger than the Industrial Revolution. This affects the entire world and it's going to be affected in a faster and more prevalent way than you ever imagined,” Draper stated earlier this week and repeated his previous forecast that “In five years you are going to try to go buy coffee with fiat currency and they are going to laugh at you because you're not using crypto."" Meanwhile, Draper is not only one giving bold price target for Bitcoin. This week, John Pfeffer, a partner at Pfeffer Capital, put 1% odds that bitcoin price will reach USD 700,000. However, Pfeffer did not elaborate, when it may happen. The forecast is based on an idea that Bitcoin may become ""the dominant non-sovereign store of value, it could be the new gold, or new reserve currency"". ***

Quoting the local police, Xinhua said that eight high-power fans were seized as well, and that this was the “largest power theft case in recent years.” The report does not note the time that the confiscation took place. The power company monitored sudden increases in line loss on one electricity line, up to 28% at the peak. The phenomenon is usually closely related with increased load current. An investigation found that the junction box of the suspected power user’s electricity meter had been short-circuited - a typical way to avoid billing. This follows China’s many regulatory crackdowns on crypto in general, from banning initial coin offerings to closing down all exchanges in the country, which led to many startups moving abroad to be able to raise funds and people finding new and more dangerous ways of obtaining cryptocurrency, such as using “crypto mules.”  After China closed their crypto exchanges for good, an underground system of “mules” and peer-to-peer networks sprung up to fill in the void left by the strict measures against them. An underground trader would buy cryptocurrencies in other markets and sell them at a premium to investors in China, who are ready to pay more since they have no other choice.

First though, let’s go back to 2008 when the US went through the worst recession in history; it was even considered to be greater than the “great depression”. The cause of it ultimately came down to the banks issuing money/mortgages to individuals that they didn’t have and the housing market burst as a result. A year later, the still unknown Satoshi Nakamoto served the world an entirely new solution to the problem and Bitcoin was born. Nakamoto’s original whitepaper outlined a peer-to-peer electronic payment system. It removed the need for a financial institution to be the intermediary between two people when sending money to one another. Now almost a decade later, there are  24 million active Bitcoin wallets currently in use around the globe. Back in 2011, a single Bitcoin was worth around a dollar, but today, BTC is valued at just over $9,300. The coin reached its record-high of just over $20,000 in mid-December 2017 and grew 1,245% in 2017 alone. Despite its popularity, a tech writer at the world-renowned MIT – Morgan Peck, just proposed a scenario (or three) where Bitcoin could become irrelevant. Let’s take a closer look. The first scenario entails the government creating their own form of digital currency – dubbed “Fedcoins”. This is basically the same system we currently have, except everything is electronic. You would set up a “wallet” with the Federal Reserve or an affiliate bank, and you’d be able to buy the digital currency with US dollars at a one-to-one ratio. The nodes, or computers running the blockchain, would be updated by institutions approved by the federal reserve. An undergraduate at Yale, Sahil Gupta, explained that “these authorized nodes could be things like Bank of America, JP Morgan—basically, trusted institutions.” Gupta went on to explain how he believes the Fedcoins will be used: “I’d imagine people first get comfortable spending Fedcoin on things like groceries and movie tickets. As people realize it’s easier than cash, as businesses realize it’s cheaper than credit cards, and as banks realize it’s literally more secure, so goes the process by which dollars are phased out of the money supply, and Fedcoin phased in.” This isn’t a new concept; The Bank of Canada built a simulation for such a currency back in 2016. Sweden has also taken massive steps towards becoming a completely cashless country. Currently, the social media giant Facebook has over 2 billion active users. The second scenario describes a large platform persuading a large group of its members to branch-off and run its own proprietary version of the Bitcoin software. This can be done by way of a ‘hard fork’ at a certain block on the original blockchain. The new group would then start building upon the new blockchain with its own specifications and could build their own corporate coin. This happened last year with the creation of Bitcoin Cash. Peck describes another scenario that seems more plausible than trying to get a large group of individuals on Facebook to hard fork. First, Facebook would create its own third-party Bitcoin wallet and integrate it into its product suite. Peck explains: “For those who already use Bitcoin, the experience is so vastly superior to what they’ve previously experienced that they immediately migrate their funds to their Facebook wallet. Those who don’t yet own any bitcoins, or have never heard of them, could be given the option of earning some on the site, either by watching advertisements or by writing Facebook posts for others to see. For those tired of watching ads, you mix in another fun feature. In exchange for a clean, ad-free experience, users can choose to let Facebook mine bitcoins with their computer’s unused processing power.” Once Bitcoin has entered into the mainstream and is used daily by millions of individuals on Facebook’s product suite, the company could quietly fork and adopt a new version meaning hte original Bitcoin could become irrelevant. Most of these users would have no clue, and now Facebook could control every aspect of its own blockchain. The last scenario in which Bitcoin could become irrelevant, is one that is already unfolding. Peck describes it as the “tokenization of everything” and it involves the world transforming into a hyper-efficient barter system. Every company would release their own cryptocurrency and an automated system would allow individuals to trade each asset seamlessly. >> Martin Lewis Files Lawsuit Against Facebook Over Crypto Scams Cambell Harvey, a professor of Finance at Duke University, explained: “Think of this as an incredibly efficient barter system. Barter is generally inefficient, but if you have a network and you tokenize the goods and services and enable it with a blockchain, it can become very efficient. Without a network, you have to find the person that wants to trade four goats for the cow. That’s very difficult, to find that person. But with a network and with collateralization of blockchain-based tokens, it’s much easier.” Bitcoin could become irrelevant? Really? Could any of these ideas actually come true? Personally, I don’t think that any new system would completely “destroy” Bitcoin, but a new project emerging in the blockchain space could easily make Bitcoin irrelevant. The original blockchain is slow and expensive and sooner or later, it will be passed by another alternative cryptocurrency that can process thousands of transactions in a second, with far fewer fees.

But since success breeds competition, Bitcoin could well be made redundant by copycats in three scenarios brought to us by TechnologyReview. The first option would be a government takeover. Not too unlikely to happen, given that many government officials, especially in the West, recognize the merits of the blockchain technology, but are wary of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to their decentralized and pseudonymous nature.  This option was described by David Andolfatto, a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and later refined by Sahil Gupta, an undergraduate at Yale University. Gupta created a system where everything works just like Bitcoin does, except the ledger is managed by institutions certified by the Federal Reserve.  Option two would be Facebook pulling a Telegram. Just like Telegram, a messaging app, that is trying to make its own coin that users could send each other or use to pay for services within the network and raised USD 1.7 billion in its pre-ICO, the same thing could happen with Facebook, given that they claim to have around two billion active users around the globe. They wouldn’t even have to make a new coin: they could just fork Bitcoin into a corporate version - or take it over completely. According to TechnologyReview, this would include building a user-friendly Facebook-hosted Bitcoin wallet, integrating it into every profile on the platform, and voila: the whole wallet-alphanumeric-string thing would be much less confusing to your average Joe. They could let users watch ads or write posts to earn coins, or even let the platform mine on their computers. After having 2.2 billion users hooked onto Bitcoin through their own platform, seizing it and making it centralized would only be a step away. Option three is quaintly named: go forth and multiply, in light of what’s already happening. There would be coins for everything, from specific services to groceries, even coins that are exclusive to stores. “My vision of the future is that there would be thousands if not millions of ways to pay for stuff,” Campbell Harvey, a professor of finance at Duke University, was quoted as saying. This is not a new idea: for example, Kodak announced a KodakCOIN, that people could use to license the rights to their photography on their platform. Although evocative of gift cards and coupons, blockchain would now make them easily and securely transferable. In the article by TechnologyReview Harvey suggests to think of this as a barter system: “If you have a network and you tokenize the goods and services and enable it with a blockchain, it can become very efficient.” This would then include moving tokens from one chain to another - an idea similar to exchanging fiat from one currency to another when traveling to another country. A broker would facilitate these exchanges and help you find the coin you need, in exchange for one you already have. The seven billion people not yet using Bitcoin might not care about the freedom of Bitcoin. As TechnologyReview puts it, convenience would always win: “If cryptocurrencies are to be widely used, it will be the habits of the masses, not the wishes of Bitcoin’s early adopters, that determine what becomes of Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision.”",763.1599999999999,1

He reiterated his bullish call for bitcoin to hit USD 250,000 within four years at Intelligence Squared U.S. debate presented in partnership with Manhattan Institute's Adam Smith Society on Saturday. When asked how Bitcoin compares with his other famous investments, he said, “This is bigger than the internet. It's bigger than the Iron Age, the Renaissance. It's bigger than the Industrial Revolution. This affects the entire world and it's going to be affected in a faster and more prevalent way than you ever imagined.” “In five years you are going to try to go buy coffee with fiat currency and they are going to laugh at you because you're not using crypto. I believe that there will be a point at which you will no longer really want any of the fiat currency,” he repeated his previous forecast. But the debate didn’t go completely in the favor of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Most of the other participants echoed the old story of anonymous and pseudonymous cryptocurrencies being attractive only to criminals, and expressed their disbelief in a decentralized system. In spite of Draper’s vivacious and to the point approach, the debate ended with 68% of the votes going towards those who think that Bitcoin is a bubble and not really here to stay. In comparison, in the pre-debate vote, Bitcoin believers actually made up the majority, but it would seem that they were swayed by the arguments of the opposing faction.",763.1599999999999,1

Some people love it, others hate it, but that doesn’t stop the crypto wheels from turning. Now, it seems like every week someone new joins the conversation and expresses their own opinion on the crypto space. The latest to do so is Tim Draper, a venture capitalist.  On Saturday, at the Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, Tim Draper declared a very bold statement. He said Bitcoin will be bigger than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Skype, and Hotmail combined. Draper, who made early investments in the companies mentioned above, also said that Bitcoin is bigger than the worldwide web. In addition, the 59-year old venture capital investor said BTC is bigger than the Iron Age, the Industrial Revolution.  Is he right though? I will admit that it is quite the statement. Plus, it’s not like Bitcoin is a guarantee. The virtual currency is quite volatile. That being said, Draper certainly has experience in the financial world, so his reasoning probably comes from a logical place. The internet investor reiterated his statement Saturday that BTC will hit the $250,000 mark within the next four years. It sounds crazy, but Tim Draper isn’t the only one making optimistic predictions about Bitcoin. Thomas Lee has said time and time again that Bitcoin will reach $25,000 this year. Currently, Bitcoin is selling for $8,911.22, which puts the coin down 0.26% in the past twenty-four hours.  In a recent interview with CoinTelegraph, Draper essentially stated that the masses shouldn’t be surprised if Bitcoin ends up becoming the largest digital currency. Why? Because Bitcoin has what is deemed “a network effect.” As the coin grows in price, the network expands. That’s why Draper stated in the interview that Bitcoin is the leader in terms of cryptocurrencies.  Draper reiterated something like this on Saturday. He gave an example of what life will be like in five years time. Tim Draper stated that in five years when we try to purchase coffee using fiat currency, we will be laughed at. Again, why? Well, according to Draper, because we are not using cryptocurrency.  It’s difficult to say whether Tim Draper’s predictions are correct or not. To say that Bitcoin is bigger than the Industrial Revolution is quite something. But, the crypto sector has proven on a number of occasions that anything is possible. All we can really do is wait and see. I will say, however, that Draper may be onto something when he says Bitcoin will likely win the long-term crypto race.  Bitcoin currently has a market capitalization of $151,133,985,750.  Featured Image: Depositphotos/© olegkrugllyak",136.48999999999978,1

Other major cryptocurrencies also gained bullish momentum, but bitcoin cash outperformed ethereum, ripple, bitcoin, ADA and EOS. Other altcoins (small cap) remained in the green zone and the market sentiment is likely to improve further this week. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price jumped recently and moved above the USD 8,300 and USD 8,500 resistance levels. BTC/USD even spiked above USD 9,000 and traded as high as USD 9,020 before starting a downside correction.
The price is currently trading flat near the USD 8,920 level, with resistances on the upside at USD 8,980 and USD 9,000. A successful close above this could open the doors for a push towards the next major pivot level at USD 10,000.
On the downside, weekly supports are at USD 8,800, USD 8,500 and USD 8,250. A push below the USD 8,250 support may clear the path for an extended correction towards USD 7,500. Ethereum
Ethereum settled above the USD 600 level. ETH/USD traded as high as USD 643 and it currently trading 3.2% higher. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 650. A successful break above USD 650 may perhaps call for a test of USD 700.
On the downside, supports are at USD 600 and USD 580. A daily close below USD 580 might ignite a trend reversal in the near term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash enjoyed an amazing week and traded above the USD 1,000 level. BCH/USD opened this week on a much better note and traded above USD 1,400. It is currently trading 19% higher to USD 1,391. Resistances are at USD 1,450 and USD 1,500.
Ripple is stable above the USD 0.85 level. It seems like XRP/USD is facing a strong resistance near 0.90. Therefore, once there is a close above USD 0.90, the price may reach USD 1.00. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, Bytom, Golem and VERI climbed by more than 20% and traded with a lot of strength. The current market sentiment is very positive, suggesting more gains in altcoins this week. To sum up, this could be another green week. However, it would be interesting to see how bitcoin price reacts if it reaches the USD 10,000 barrier.",136.48999999999978,1

Morgan Stanley, an American investment bank, analysts say that if Bitcoin can't recover USD 8,600 soon, miners will likely find it unprofitable to keep creating the cryptocurrency. In a note on Thursday, equity analyst Charlie Chan and his team told CNBC, “We estimate the break-even point for big mining pools should be USD 8,600, even if we assume a very low electricity cost (USD 0.03 kW/h).” Companies selling mining chips are better off, as the Morgan Stanley model estimates an asic (application-specific integrated circuit) would break even over two years if Bitcoin traded near USD 5,000. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC, is not so sure. Morgan Stanley estimates that about 10% of TSMC revenue now depends on cryptocurrency mining demand. The company has already been forced to cut its revenue forecast from 10%-15% to only 10%, “due to the smartphone weakness and the uncertainty in cryptocurrency mining demand.” Meanwhile, some people have decided to sell their mining rigs and are tweeting offers - but not for this reason. As economist and investor Tuur Demeester points out in a tweet, profitability has dropped, but the original seller in this case disagrees - he’s only selling because his hosting contract hasn’t been renewed.  Yet still as profitable as they were when I originally invested in them...months before profitability exceeded my wildest dreams.  I’m selling because my hosting contract isn’t being renewed. In a Bloomberg tweet, the discussion turns even more interesting. “It’s self-stabilizing,” claims one side of the debate - the majority, really - accusing the news outlet of spreading FUD and bad journalism.

The price did move higher and cleared the USD 8,250 and USD 8,300 resistance levels. It boosted the market sentiment and many cryptocurrencies extended gains, including ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin, Neo, ADA and QTUM. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price traded as high as USD 8,398 recently before correcting lower. BTC/USD is currently (GMT 9:30 AM) up 1.45% to USD 8,300, with an immediate support on the downside at USD 8,250, followed by the USD 8,200 pivot level. 
On the upside, the price may perhaps face resistance near USD 8,360 - USD 8,380. If buyers succeed in pushing the price above USD 8,380, there could be an upward acceleration towards the USD 8,500 level. 
The technical structure is bullish above the USD 8,000 support, and there are chances of further upsides in the near term. Ethereum
Ethereum extended gains above the USD 540 and USD 550 resistance levels. ETH/USD traded towards the USD 590 level before correcting lower. It is currently trading 7.5% higher from the USD 530 low.
On the upside, there are many hurdles below the USD 600 level, starting with USD 580. On the downside, supports are at USD 550 and USD 540. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash continued to outperform most major cryptocurrencies. It is currently trading 9.7% higher to USD 975. Recently, it traded close to the USD 1,000 level before it faced a strong selling interest. BCH/USD remains in a bullish zone, but an upward break above the USD 1,000 resistance won’t be easy.
Ripple blasted higher today and broke many resistances such as USD 0.75, USD 0.80 and USD 0.85. XRP/USD is now in a solid uptrend and it could continue to move higher towards the USD 1.00 level. On the downside, supports are at USD 0.80 and USD 0.78. Other Altcoins Market Today
Almost all altcoins are trading in the green zone. It seems like the crypto market is poised to extend gains since the total market cap is now above the USD 350 billion. The next target for buyer could the USD 500 billion.

This time, he is offering USD 100,000 to Reddit, a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website, if they appoint a new moderator to the popular subreddit r/Bitcoin. Ver, who owns Bitcoin.com and has signed on to the “Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin” movement, is now calling Reddit out for not being “a profitable company” lately, and is offering to help them out of this predicament by paying them USD 100,000 if they “simply appoint a moderator to /r/Bitcoin who supports free speech.”  The two most popular subreddits dedicated to Bitcoin are r/Bitcoin and r/BTC, and the two are in a tense relationship that’s only been worsening over the years. r/Bitcoin has often been accused of censorship its moderation of posts related to the years-long Bitcoin scaling debate. r/BTC, however, is more of a Bitcoin Cash subreddit, regardless of the name - and Roger Ver himself is one of the moderators.  Although Ver has his number of supporters cheering him on in the replies to his tweet, some of the answers, especially the contrary ones, are genuinely funny. For example, one user replied: Speech isn't free if you pay $100k for it :) Others have gone much further. A user tweeted: I really like dogs. I will pay @reddit $100,000 to appoint a dog-friendly moderator on r/cats. Dogs are the real cats. This unjust censorship has gone on too long! BABIES R DYIIIINNNNGGGG!!!!

Gox exchange and often vying for the spot of least favorite person in the crypto community, has found that it’s not very easy to find and/or keep a job when you’re considered a villain after losing 850,000 Bitcoins. Although 200,000 of those Bitcoins ended up surfacing somehow and the rest is believed to be stolen by hackers, this didn’t help Karpeles with the fact that he’s still in the middle of a lawsuit for charges of embezzlement, manipulation of electronic data, and breach of trust. Job prospects would seem grim for anyone else. However, Karpeles’s LinkedIn profile now lists the position of new chief technology officer of London Trust Media, a Denver-based company that boasts the world’s largest paid virtual private network (VPN) service and is investing in cryptocurrency projects. Karpeles confirmed this to Fortune in a written message, after a bit of nudging. His new employer hasn’t been so shy with broadcasting the news. Andrew Lee, co-founder, chairman and chief of lab division at London Trust Media, said for Fortune, “Mark fought and fell. And although he fell, his skills, experience and know-how unarguably continue to exist. <...> I am more than willing to give a second chance to Mark in this fight’s critical hour.” Lee doesn’t mind Karpeles’s past. “I wouldn’t dare say that the person who architected the Titanic should never again architect another ship,” he said. How this will turn out remains to be seen, although Karpeles is only too happy to wash his hands of crypto, citing his lack of belief in the purpose of Bitcoin.  Given that Mt.

It’s actually a thing in the stock market, too. Best of all, it’s a joke that’s gone too far. Some chart analysts like to find pictures in charts that remind them of something, presumably because just looking at charts does not seem like the most interesting pastime in the world. These patterns are also a handy tool for surmising what sort of behavior can be anticipated next. Katie Martin of the Financial Times got the idea of a vomiting camel on the internet and made a whole gag out of it. It comes down to a technique similar to recognizing constellations: quite a bit of imagination. She thought it was an obvious joke - but not many caught on, really. She explains the whole thing in a post, showing how she just drew camels wherever, and tried to make them throw up. In the case of Bitcoin, last November she was completely right, though.  Except, in 2014, CNBC ran a segment on the vomiting camel that was tongue-in-cheek, but was taken too seriously. And this April, TradingView, for example, had a piece called “The Dreaded Vomiting Camel of Bitcoin.” ""The pattern speaks for itself of how the camel is drawn over the lifespan of the stock/coin. The end of this pattern is the actual vomit which show the 3 red arrows of the drop that may be impending,"" the piece said. Taking it seriously is just not thinking it through. It’s a badly drawn picture of a sick mammal, how predictive can it be for any market? Still, if you can find a pattern in market behavior through MS Paint pictures of animals, godspeed. She concludes her explaining post by saying, “If you buy or sell anything based on the camels, then the very best of luck to you. You'll need it.

On the other hand, bitcoin, ethereum and ripple consolidated in a tight range above key supports in the bullish zone. Once these major cryptocurrencies stage an upside breakout, the market could accelerate higher. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is slowly gaining momentum above the USD 8,000 support. However, BTC/USD must clear a strong sell wall near the USD 8,250 - USD 8,300 zone. 
A successful close above the USD 8,300 resistance may perhaps start a fresh bullish wave toward the USD 8,700 and USD 9,000 levels. The price is waiting for a catalyst for a bullish breakout. 
On the downside, supports are near the USD 8,000 and USD 7,800 levels. Ethereum
Ethereum is showing signs of an upside break above the USD 530 level. ETH/USD may soon extend gains above the USD 535 and 540 levels. If buyers gain momentum, the price could even break the USD 550 level.
If there is a downside correction, the USD 520 and USD 510 levels are likely to act as decent supports. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash once again performed really well among the top five cryptocurrencies. BCH/USD tested the USD 900 level and is currently trading 6.1% higher at USD 888. Above the USD 900 resistance, the price could make an attempt to test the USD 1,000 level.
Ripple is trading nicely above the USD 0.70 level. XRP/USD traded close to the USD 0.74 level before starting a downside correction. It seems like the price may continue to grind higher toward the USD 0.78 level in the near term. Other Altcoins Market Today

However, he is far from thrilled with the opinion his hero has on the sticky subject of cryptocurrency. Out of all the things he’s learned from Buffett, Sam Ling has kept an appreciation for index funds closest to his heart - but he’d now like to apply that outlook to crypto. He told CNBC, “Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are too volatile, and that's why we are launching cryptocurrency indexes. Over the past six months, our index has a lower decline than bitcoin during corrections, but has outperformed bitcoin by 50 to 80 percent during upsurges.” Out of all the advice he’s received at this USD 2.35 million lunch, Ling recalls, “Buffett touched on lots of issues during that lunch, but in the end, he said, ‘Focus on what you are doing and you are already successful.’ This quote really left me with a deep impression and I followed his advice.” But Ling is not that starstruck: he believes in the power of crypto. “Warren Buffett just won a 10-year bet that an index fund would outperform a collection of hedge funds over that time.

Spencer Bogart, partner at Blockchain Capital, told CNBC, “Tax-selling has been a significant factor in downward crypto prices over the past few weeks. I would expect this downward pressure to abate after tax day.” The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) views Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as property, meaning profits from transactions are subject to capital gains tax. The problem with that is that, while this is clear in principle, nobody really knows how to apply it to their crypto gains, many of which people didn’t document in time. Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told CNBC that US traders owe a total of USD 25 billion in taxes for digital currency holdings due to the prices rising more than 1,300% last year in the case of Bitcoin. Lee is also the only major Wall Street strategist to issue crypto price targets, and in his opinion, Bitcoin may be hitting a similar bottom to where it was a month before it hit USD 20,000 in 2017 (it was USD 7,000 - USD 8,000 at the time). Pantera Capital Founder and CEO Dan Morehead said in an investor letter published last week that bitcoin is ""highly likely to have exceeded USD 20,000 within a year.""

Kelly said “it sounds crazy” to consider that BTC [Bitcoin] already had a 4,000 percent return over two years and a 3,000 percent return in four years may be a “continuation of the trend we’ve seen.” Brian Kelly, however, moved one step forward. He compared the bitcoin mania to Internet mania in late 80’s and early 90’s. He believes bitcoin is behaving like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) during the early days of the internet revolution.  He further added, “I think this technology is going to work, it’s going to be game-changing, but it’s very early days so that we can have this massive volatility,” The expert expects higher trading volume will allow the Bitcoin price to reach $250K in the next four years. Market pundits are blaming tax season, social media bans and uncertainty regarding regulators role for the vast bitcoin price correction during the last thirty days. Tax season is now almost over, and the new investments are flowing into the market – which is creating a bull run in crypto markets, analysts say. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization jumped almost $70 billion in the last four days, driven by 14% appreciation in Bitcoin value and a substantial contribution from altcoins.

Its price is perhaps the most consulted aspect of the coin and at the same time (ironically) the least “revolutionary.” Over-volatility of price and unstoppable news of frauds and substantial investments have sparked a lot of debate and predictions; something that has become a popular conversational topic among hodlers and cryptocurrency enthusiasts. The community’s interest in these fluctuations is so high that exclusive memes and words have even emerged: Hodl, Lambo, moon, scamcoin, are the best known. Other jargons such as whale, buy the dip, weak hands, fomo, pump and dump, etc. have been adapted from different environments and are already natural to investors and fans on the cryptosphere. After the exponential rise in bitcoin prices, the strong bearish trend since January led to posts with more HODLS and fewer MOONS in social media. The financial authorities of traditional banking were busy cataloging the bitcoin as a bubble with some discouraging forecasts that did not help at all to reverse the trend. But it seems that the trend has bounced back after hitting the $6000 support level thanks to some announcements pointing to substantial investments in crypto by  giants such as George Soros, the Rockefellers, and Goldman-Sachs. From that moment on, the bulls began to gain strength in the economic game of crypto markets. One of the first to take the plunge with a value prediction was Tim Draper, a venture capital investor founder of Draper Associates, a VC firm with an investment portfolio of at least 80 successful companies including Tesla, Baidu, Coinbase, Bancor, Skype, Twitch and Robin Hood. In a rather striking act and with a market still bearish in the short term, he dared to predict a price of $250,000 by 2022. A figure that may seem exaggerated after such a sharp drop. However, Mr. Draper’s predictions do not seem to be very far from reality as they are gaining confidence and followers who trust in the possibility of the realization of this prophecy. One of those who has recently supported this prediction is Brian Kelly, Founder, and CEO of BKCM LLC. A company focused on crypto investment. In an interview for CNBC’s “Fast Money” show, Melissa Lee (host), asks Mr. Kelly for his opinion of Draper’s predictions, which may sound crazy to the public, to which, he responded with a tone of confidence “It sounds crazy, but think about it this way: That’s 4 years from now, that’s a 3000% return from here -which again sounds crazy- but over the last two years bitcoin had a 4000% percent of return. So, now again, it’s parabolic, but it would just be a continuation of the trend that we’re seeing” For this type of trends to occur, Brian Kelly says it requires an increase in the volume of transactions: something that large institutional capitals could promote, contributing in turn to lower volatility: “If the number of transactions […] catch up a bit, then I do think we’ve bottomed here, and I do think we’ve got a sustainable bull run ahead of us.” When asked about his “Personal forecast,” Brian Kelly seems to agree with Tom Lee’s prediction: “We can get transaction volumes up again. Then, there’s no reason why this couldn’t be at 20-25 thousand by the end of the year again; we can make a new high.” Featured Image: twitter",-278.89999999999964,0

Combined, these have a value of USD 941, or around 0.12 BTC, news.bitcoin.com reported. Additionally, without Bitcoin Cash, only USD 206 or 0.026 BTC remains - a possible proof of the futility and triviality of Bitcoin forking. Following the launch of Bitcoin Cash last August, subsequent forks have been rapidly deteriorating, quality-wise. Forkdrop.io has a handy list that shows most of these forks are not tradable. The website’s resources include guides to claiming these forked coins and sections on passive and active airdrops. If you hold (or HODL) BTC, you can claim these forks for free. But with these numbers, claiming them may just not be worth it. Bitcoin Candy, Bitcoin Cloud or even Bitcoin Holocaust are names that hardly could inspire any confidence.  Forked altcoins, although fewer in number, are just as useless - forkdrop.io lists 18 altcoin forks, although many more have forked by cloning the code and then adding their own twist. A well-known example is Verge, a fork of Dogecoin that was never made available on a 1:1 basis to Doge holders. A total of six Ethereum forks, three Litecoin forks, and six Monero forks are listed on the website, along with a couple of others. And out of all the altcoin forks, three of them are tradeable - with a combined value of USD 20. Interestingly, there is one fork not listed on the website is Bitcoin Private, as it simultaneously forked from Zclassic and Bitcoin. It started trading at around USD 80, but has dropped four-fold in under a month. In short, forking may be destined for failure no matter what the resulting coin is like after Bitcoin Cash - or at least that’s what all the other examples are telling us. The cost of creating a hard fork is essentially zero, so we will continue to see more and more hard forks that attempt to create a user base via forking coins to an already established community, as reported by Cryptonews.com. According to experts, in order to evaluate a hard fork and its potential it's always good to ask three questions: 1) Does the fork solve a real problem? 2) Is the team behind the fork credible and competent? 3) Is there a healthy community and open discussion surrounding the fork? If the answer to any of these three questions is a ""no"", it should raise a red flag for an investor.",-278.89999999999964,0

The crypto market turned green and prices soared between 10-25%. More importantly, BTC/USD broke two important resistances at USD 7,500 and USD 8,000, opening the doors for more gains this week. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price cleared a major hurdle at USD 8,000 this past week and moved towards the USD 8,400-8,500 zone. On the upside, BTC/USD is facing a crucial resistance near USD 8,500, which must be cleared for further gains.
On the downside, there are many supports such as USD 8,000, USD 7,800 and USD 7,500. If the pair drops below the last mentioned USD 7,500 support, there could be a change in the trend.
In the short term, the price may trade in a small range before it makes an attempt to overcome sellers near USD 8,250 and USD 8,500. Ethereum
Ethereum also followed bitcoin and registered around 20% gains this past week. ETH/USD settled above a major barrier at USD 500, and it is currently consolidating gains above the stated level.
Weekly resistances on the upside are at USD 530 and 550. A push above the USD 550 level could clear the path for a bullish acceleration toward USD 600. On the downside, supports are at USD 500, USD 480 and USD 465. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash had a good run and its price moved past the USD 700 and 750 resistance levels. BCH/USD is now positioned nicely above USD 750 and it seems to be preparing for a break above the USD 800 resistance.
Ripple finally broke to the upside and settled above the USD 0.60 resistance. If the current momentum stays intact, XRP/USD could move above USD 0.70 and test the USD 0.75 level in the near term. Other Altcoins Market Today

The survey was conducted by exchange platform Bithumb, who said that traders’ average holdings were worth some USD 5,050. Per the survey, 35% of respondents said they had used a cryptocurrency exchange platform, while 40% of cryptocurrency investors said “curiosity” had driven them to buy tokens. The survey also found that older investors tended to make much bigger investments, with respondents in their fifties investing an average of over three times as much in cryptocurrencies as people in their twenties. There is also a huge discrepancy between the average high among investors, which stands at some USD 21,000 per the survey, and the average low investment - which is a mere USD 215. Respondents also said that security systems and system stability were the most important factors to consider when choosing which exchange platform to use. April has been a mixed bag for South Korean exchange platforms, with a trading information leak suspected at Bithumb last week, the arrest of two rival exchange CEOs the week before – and a range of new partnership deals announced at the start of the month.",-278.89999999999964,0

That’s what a man from Malaysia just did – and it went horribly wrong. It might have been better if the man was going to Singapore for a shopping spree, but he wasn’t. The man went to Singapore with the intention of purchasing a wad of Bitcoins, and instead, he found himself at the center of the latest Bitcoin scandal. Here’s what happened. On Thursday, reports surfaced from various local mediums which stated that two men were arrested in Singapore. The charges? Being the masterminds behind the latest Bitcoin scandal. That is if you consider what the two men did to be a “scandal”. According to the reports, Mr. Pang Joon Hau flew from Malaysia to Singapore solely to purchase Bitcoins. Not only that, Mr. Pang flew to Singapore expressly to purchase Bitcoins with cash. $365,000 to be exact. Mr. Pang, who was assaulted along with his broker, had set plans to meet with two Bitcoin brokers. He was scheduled to meet them at his hotel on Sunday, April 8, 2018. Things didn’t go as planned. Both men are said to have assaulted Mr. Pang and fled with the cash – all $365,000. As unfortunate as this incident may be, one cannot help but think of how uncommon it is for people to transact the digital currency in person. It is for these reasons the police in Singapore have decided to launch an investigation into Mr. Poon. According to various reports, the Singaporean police will be focusing on why Mr. Poon came to Singapore (aside from the purchasing of the currency) and where Mr. Pang obtained this kind of cash in the first place. Singapore has been reasonably vocal when it comes to the cryptocurrency sector. It is one of the many countries to have called for more regulation on digital currencies, with Singapore making the call on February 6, 2018. >>Can Blockchain Help the Data Crisis? Not Likely – Here’s Why. Of course, this isn’t the first Bitcoin scandal to surface this year. It’s definitely not going to be the last, either. At the start of 2018, a famous cryptocurrency blogger, Pavel Nyashin, was robbed in his own home after bragging about the wealth he obtained from cryptocurrency. Nyashian had 24 mln rubles in cash stolen from a safe that sat in his home. Meanwhile, regulators in Texas warned the public today of a potential “widespread fraud” in the cryptocurrency sector. As for Bitcoin (BTC) itself, the virtual currency jumped by $1,000 in one hour yesterday.

Yesterday, at a blockchain party held at his self-named Draper University in San Mateo, California, he predicted that the world’s largest cryptocurrency would reach $250,000 a coin. The video can be seen below.  Tim Draper’s 2018 Bitcoin Prediction is $250,000 by 2022 (live stream) from Bitcoin    In the video Draper says: “I’m thinking $250,000 a bitcoin by 2022. Believe it.

Predicting bitcoin at $25k by 2022. — Tim Draper (@TimDraper) April 13, 2018 While this may seem a bit crazy, given the bear market the past few months Draper has a fairly good track record of predicting Bitcoin’s price movements. In 2015, the VC mogul was right when he predicted that BTC would reach $10,000 by the end of 2017 because it soared past $13,000. With that said, market observers aren’t taking his bullish forecast lightly. Draper holds an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from Standford and has an MBA from Harvard, coming from a long family line of venture capitalists. Blockchain is the Future Draper isn’t just keen on digital currencies but believes blockchain technology will completely transform and revive finance, healthcare and various other industries. He spoke to the San Mateo Daily Journal about blockchain and said: “The blockchain is one of the most transformational technologies that has happened in the history of the world, and it is totally worth celebrating,” he said. “We look forward to lots of crypto fun and excitement from the event.” Draper isn’t the only billionaire eyeing the blockchain technology, the Rockefeller family, whose worth is around $1 trillion, have partnered with Coinfund to aid blockchain-based start-up companies. The Rockefeller family isn’t interested in turning short-term profits but sees this as a long-term investment in blockchain technology. The entry of Old Money into the cryptocurrency and blockchain space is another sign that blockchain is here to stay. >> Tom Lee Predicts BTC to hit $25,000 Featured Image: Silicon",-5.130000000000109,0

Later, BTC joined the party, broke a crucial resistance at USD 7,000, which resulted in a sharp upside move of more than USD 1,000. It seems like the crypto market consolidation phase completed, resulting in increase in trading volumes.  Fundamentally, a key development was from the Islamic community. There was a declaration by an Islamic scholar that bitcoin is compatible by Sharia Law. More importantly, bitcoin and ethereum charts were heading towards a technical breakout during the past few weeks. The recent upside drift suggests that the breakout was bullish and prices are likely to continue higher. There was a solid short liquidation and unwinding of short (sell) BTC trades, resulting in a short squeeze from well below USD 6,800 to well above USD 8,000. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price rocketed above yesterday’s mentioned USD 7,000 resistance. BTC/USD gained around 20% and traded above the USD 8,000 level. The pair is now trading at USD 8,106 and it may perhaps continue to rise towards the USD 8,500 level.
If there is a downside correction, the price may find support near the USD 8,000 level. Below the stated USD 8,000, the price could test the USD 7,800 support.
On the upside, before the USD 8,500 barrier, the price may find selling interest near the USD 8,250 level. However, the current trend is super bullish and bulls are completely in control for a run towards USD 8,500. Ethereum
Ethereum also followed bitcoin and rocketed above the USD 500 level. ETH/USD is currently trading 22% higher at USD 515. On the upside, the next major hurdle for buyers is at USD 540.
On the downside, the broken resistances at USD 500 and 480 are likely to act as supports in the short term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash moved sharply above the USD 700 level and is currently up 15% to USD 760. BCH/USD pair is now seems to be heading towards the USD 800 level, which is a key resistance.
Ripple soared higher and moved past the USD 0.60 resistance, which is a bullish signal. XRP/USD is now in a positive zone and the price may continue to move higher towards USD 0.70. Other Altcoins Market Today

Thomas Lee, head of research of Fundstrat Global Advisors LLC, cited a combination of Santander’s plan for a blockchain-based payment application, tax-related selling almost over and speculative short investors being squeezed out of the market for the surge, Bloomberg reported. Given that this is perhaps the most bullish shift in the market in this year, following the bloodbath in winter and the subsequent bearish atmosphere, how is the community reacting? People are not as enthusiastic as before, actually. However, the community is showing more maturity than ever before, perhaps: as one user of Reddit points out, if this jump had come a few months earlier, “pеople would have shouted end of bear market moon lambo and so on,” but now, the discussion has turned to “leveraged shorts, manipulation, scepticism towards the pump and overall constructive thinking” in a big step away from the usual bright-eyed optimism. A commenter on the same thread thinks that, “The moon/lambo types have already forgotten about crypto and moved on to the next shiny thing.” In another thread, user u/florian_ehrbar says, “I’ve been watching this [market jump] and my jaw just keeps dropping!” as proof that nobody is quite indifferent. Twitter is also silent, as the only people celebrating seem to be fans of mostly controversial altcoins such as TRON. The community is showing more restraint than ever before. This does not mean people are not overjoyed, however. Anyone who has invested in almost any coin in the crypto space is gaining, but what’s conspicuously lacking are the memes and the “when moon” and “when lambo” comments. Although benign and not unfunny (when not overused), they did cause the rest of the world to see the crypto space as a childish place, not yet a force to be reckoned with.

Lee told Futures Now that “We still feel pretty confident that bitcoin is a great risk-reward and we think it could reach $25,000 by the end of the year.” Lee, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat, was noted earlier in stating that the U.S. tax season would cause a mass crypto selloff. By now, with taxes due April 17th, he says that much of the selling pressure has begun to ease off. (Could this be another reason for the crypto market green that we’re seeing today?) >> Indian Crypto Exchanges Consider Relocating in Response to Indian Crypto Ban Bitcoin is currently selling for $7,693.79, which puts the coin up 11.36% in the past 24 hours. To reach Lee’s predicted price of $25,000, BTC would have to grow another 225% by the end of the year. In one year, since April 12th, 2017, Bitcoin has grown by 541%, so it’s certainly doable, but the question is, will it? From the start of this year to now, Bitcoin’s price has dropped by 45%, according to CoinMarketCap data. This means that Bitcoin will have to recover by that much and then some in order to reach Lee’s estimated price of $25,000. Although Bitcoin has been spiralling downwards since the start of this year, since its inception in 2013, Bitcoin has grown by 5,586% overall. According to Lee, it’s time for Bitcoin (BTC) to recover what it has lost since achieving its all-time high back in mid-December. “It’s overdue,” Lee told ‘Futures Now.’ “Bitcoin was incredibly oversold. When you look at metrics like price-to-book, which is ‘money cost,’ or our bitcoin misery index, it’s pretty much what you saw at the end of the 2014 bear market, not the start.” Do you agree with Thomas Lee?

Bitcoin price attempted an upside move, but it could not move above the USD 7,000 resistance. BTC/USD traded near USD 6,990 before starting a downside move.
The price is currently down 0.3% and is trading near the USD 6,830 level. The next supports on the downside are at USD 6,750 and 6,600. 
To initiate an upside move, bitcoin buyers need to break the USD 7,000 barrier. It is an important resistance, therefore, a successful break above the stated level could open the doors for a solid bullish wave in the near term towards USD 7,500. Ethereum
Ethereum traded nicely and made a new weekly high above the USD 435 level. ETH/USD is currently up 1.3% to USD 422, with an immediate support at USD 415. Below the mentioned USD 415 support, the price could retest the USD 400 level.

He will also accept crypto, says the ad - but then it’s worth the equivalent of USD 45 million. Aside from BTC, he will also accept Ethereum and Ripple. This increase is to offset the volatility in crypto price, he said to Wall Street Journal: “I’m a true believer in these networks, but it’s very volatile.

Brady Tucker, of Idaho in the United States, says the credit card provider began charging him interest rates of as much as 30% per year – as well as additional fees – on cryptocurrency purchases made through Coinbase exchange in January this year. Tucker says the fees are disproportionate and unprecedented, and lodged a class-action suit at a federal court in Manhattan, New York. Tucker says he wants a full refund of the fees he has been charged – as well as damages of USD 1 million. Tucker made reference to a quote made last year by JPMorgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, who has denounced Bitcoin in the past. Last year Dimon said he would “fire” any of his staff whom he found trading cryptocurrencies for ""stupidity."" Tucker wrote, “It appears that in addition to firing its ’stupid’ employees, Chase has elected to start fining its ‘stupid’ customers: unilaterally.” JPMorgan has recently announced it will not allow cryptocurrency purchases, saying that account holders might dispute charges if they bought coins from what they later discovered were fake initial coin offering (ICO) issuers.

Bitcoin is not only the king of cryptos but also the king of bubbles. According to Bloomberg, a study by Bank of America Merrill Lynch on the behavior and evolution of Bitcoin’s prices places it as the most significant asset price bubble in history. The study compares the price trends of bitcoin with other similar phenomena such as the U.S. stock market in 1929 crash in the Stock Markets, the Mississippi Company, and South Sea Company in the 18th century, the behavior of gold pricing, and the famous Dutch Tulip bubble.  The graph attempts to show that of all the bubbles, bitcoin is the one that has achieved the most significant growth in the narrowest range of time. Whereas the most critical bubbles such as tulips have a value of less than 40x increase in value, the graph shows an increase (in a similar timeframe) of at least 60x for Bitcoin. In the last few months, the Bank of America has been very attentive to the behavior of bitcoin, and while just a few weeks ago they told the SEC at about the danger that Bitcoin posed to the expansion of their financial services, today their research results do not seem to contrast with their previous assessments. Such claims are not new to the world of Bitcoin: 99Bitcoin has kept track of how many times the media has “killed” Bitcoin, and with 278 “deaths” registered since 2010, an average of almost three rumors per month is more than enough reason to show that it is not always necessary to believe what the powerful say. Just as an example, let’s look at the behavior of Bitcoin prices today:  That looks pretty “Bubbly”, right? In weeks BTC has lost almost 60% of its value!… And the trend does not seem to stop Before we forge a response, let’s look at a bit of a similar graph:  This graph, as you can see, shows a previous BTC price fluctuation. What is happening now is nothing new, it has already occurred (and in worse proportions), and it is merely part of the natural behavior of an asset that is being capitalized, and that is not only being inserted into the market but is radically changing it. It is unfair to make such decontextualized comparisons, so let’s put things into perspective a little and analyze this graph.  Bank of America research is either decontextualized or charged with the subjectivity of an institution that studies a phenomenon considered “risky” for its existence. On social networks, the community has expressed some opinions. A notable example is Blockchainchick who made a comparison of Bitcoin with the opinions spread towards Amazon; a company that has been able to demonstrate its successful career despite the FUD that it suffered during its consolidation. Bitcoin has arrived in the world of finance to stay. Although the future is not written, the confidence of the users and the massive adoption will put a number on its future price; confidence can easily be damaged by third-party opinions (Pump and Dump, anyone?). However, if there is one thing that characterizes the community of crypto users it is that despite the nervousness they may have in the short term, there is always unity and optimism in the paradigm shift that cryptos can achieve… and that is perhaps the best reason to prove that Bitcoin will be bullish soon. I, personally, prefer one bitcoin over one tulip. Featured Image: Twitter ",124.84999999999945,1

In a note to clients on Tuesday, Barclays analyst Joseph Abate writes, “Like infection, transmission - especially to those with ‘fear of missing out’ - is by word-of-mouth, via blogs, news reports and personal anecdotes. However, once full adoption is approached, the price decline is sustained and rapid.” This model suggests that crypto awareness is universal at this point, so only a tiny group of the population could catch speculative interest, and current holders are also developing “immunity” to more investment. “We believe the speculative froth phase of cryptocurrency investment – and perhaps peak prices – may have passed,” Abate says. The Barclays model splits the population into three sectors: the susceptible ones, the vulnerable and the immune people. The infected make up 0.1% of the population who first bought crypto with an unknown long-term fundamental value, while the susceptibles make up 25% due to FOMO (fear of missing out), mostly. A number of people are “immune” and not likely to ever buy. Still, according to the analyst, crypto may see an increase in demand from weaker economies with little to no investment opportunities. Abate explains, “Cryptocurrencies may have a home in low-trust corners of the global economy. Broader adoption of crypto technologies faces critical challenges and strong incumbents.” The total cryptocurrency market capitalization, according to Barclays, has a “generous upper bound” between USD 660 billion and USD 780 billion - an amount near the total at the end of January.",124.84999999999945,1

Barclays analysts based their findings on the models that epidemiologists use to track diseases. The models were compared to Bitcoin’s price swings from the past seven years. The analysts were checking if there were any connections between how an infectious disease spreads and how Bitcoin has performed in the past to see if they could predict any of Bitcoin’s future. The results were surprising. Barclays stated: “We developed a theoretical model of an asset price with a pool of speculative investors and compared it with actual Bitcoin price behavior to see what it might imply for the future dynamics. The model has clear parallels with compartmental models of the spread of an infectious disease in epidemiology.” Barclays says this connection is why Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are slackening off now. Back in December, when the crypto hype was at its highest, prices swelled. However, like a spreading infection, it can only continue growing for so long. >> Bitcoin Wallet Supporting Lightning Network Removed from Google Play They explained this reasoning further: “As more of the population become asset holders, the share of the population available to become new buyers – the potential ‘host’ population – falls, while the share of the population that are potential sellers (‘recoveries’) increases. Eventually, this leads to a plateauing of prices, and progressively, as random shocks to the larger supply population push up the ratio of sellers to buyers […] prices begin to fall. That induces speculative selling pressure as price declines are projected forward exponentially. Analogously, this occurs with infectious diseases when the immunity threshold is reached; ie, the point at which a sufficient portion of the population becomes immune such that there are no more secondary infections.” So, essentially, growth (spread) will stagnate because there will be no one left to ‘catch the cold that is Bitcoin,’ if you will. Is this the stage that we’re in right now? “Unlike past peaks in Bitcoin prices, the survey evidence, based on our modelling, suggests that the speculative bubble in crypto currencies may have passed its peak,” stated Barclays. Do you agree? Bitcoin is currently selling for $6,830.23, which puts BTC down 66% from its all-time high in December, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Other major cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, bitcoin cash and ripple also gained traction. However, they all failed to hold gains and started a fresh bearish wave. It seems like a technical rejection in bitcoin and altcoins coupled with a new round of selling. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price declined 5.6% and is currently trading at USD 6,750. If BTC/USD continues to move down, the next support is near USD 6,600. However, the most important support is around the last low at USD 6,400. 
Should the price fail to stay above USD 6,400, there are chances of a downside reaction towards USD 6,000 in the near term.  On the flip side, the price has to trade above the USD 7,000 level to overcome an increase in selling pressure.
Above USD 7,000, the next resistance awaits at USD 7,200 and 7,250. Ethereum
Ethereum was rejected from the USD 430 region and is currently down 7.1% to USD 395. ETH/USD is back in the red zone and if sellers remain in control, it could decline towards the all-important USD 360 support.
To start a recovery, the price must settle above the USD 400-405 area. Above the mentioned USD 405, the price may perhaps retest the USD 430 resistance. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash failed to stay above the USD 650 level and declined sharply. BCH/USD is down 6.3% to USD 635 and it seems like the pair may continue to move down. Immediate supports on the downside are at USD 620 and USD 600.
Ripple is back below the USD 0.50 support. XRP/USD failed on many occasions to settle above the mentioned USD 0.50, which puts it at a risk of further declines in the near term. Other Altcoins Market Today

The company was successful in completing a fork, which increased buying sentiment during the past three days.

Uri Shaked is an Israeli “Google Developer Expert for Web Technologies, Maker and Public Speaker”, according to his Medium profile. He  managed to find a way to use Google’s BigQuery, a big data analytics web service, for crypto mining. Although his Medium post goes deep into the technical details, from explaining how mining works in the first place to deep into how and why this is actually free, the gist is this: his approach is technically just generating a large amount of random data using pre-existing tables, as mining basically involves guessing the right number. Although BigQuery only allows up to 1 terabyte of data analysis per month and then charges per analyzed byte above that amount, as far as they are concerned, he’s analyzing zero bytes per hash. In other words - for free. He also points out that while this works in theory, it is not an actual process that could generate him any sort of income: “even if such a miner was built, when competing with all the dedicated mining hardware running around the world, it would make me roughly USD 5 a year,” his post explains, going on to clarify that although not viable, knowing that crypto can be mined this way is “priceless.”",39.32000000000062,1

But is this still the case, or has the time for cryptocurrency come at last? Checking the prices of crypto shows us that the bear market continues and shows no signs of slowing - all the biggest coins have taken a nosedive this year. For Brian Kelly, founder and CEO at BKCM LLC, an investment firm focused on cryptocurrencies, this means more screen time for blockchain. “Last year was all about the froth, and the promise of, 'Hey, this guy's building the new Facebook.' I think this year is going to be about building the Ciscos [an American multinational technology conglomerate],” he said to CNBC. In his opinion, “2018 is going to be the year of infrastructure and also the year of Ethereum competitors.” Adding to this, he says there are many risk rewards to using a platform like Cardano that runs the blockchain technology for its coin ADA: “It's relatively new. You can do smart contracts on it. You can do blockchain 3.0. It's an Ethereum competitor in the year of Ethereum competitors.” But the perspective could have shifted from blockchain back to crypto in the opinion of Elizabeth Stark, the CEO of Lightning Labs. She told a never-before told story for Yahoo Finance about the overpowering narrative of the superiority of blockchain and how it impacted Lightning Labs:  
“When we first pitched my company Lightning Labs, we actually took the word ‘Bitcoin’ out of our deck and our marketing material because it was so much about blockchain. Now, I feel like we’ve entered into a ‘Bitcoin, not blockchain’ world, where people understand the value of cryptocurrency technology and what these can bring.” “When we first pitched my company Lightning Labs, we actually took the word ‘Bitcoin’ out of our deck and our marketing material because it was so much about blockchain. Now, I feel like we’ve entered into a ‘Bitcoin, not blockchain’ world, where people understand the value of cryptocurrency technology and what these can bring.” This could mean better business for her: since Lightning is a second layer built on top of the Bitcoin protocol that can facilitate faster and cheaper transactions, because the payments happen off-blockchain, Bitcoin could become more viable as a payment option. She goes on to explain, “We’re talking many thousands of transactions per second, one day maybe even millions per second… Bitcoin at its base layer can’t do that. But Lightning, because it’s this layer on top of it, can.” Not everyone agrees: in the “Bitcoin is a bubble” corner that the industry seems to have gotten used to, Bank of America Corp says Bitcoin, “the biggest bubble in history,” is popping. As reported by Bloomberg, Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett wrote that Bitcoin is tracking the downfalls of the other massive asset-price bubbles in history less than one year out from its record, comparing it, for example, to the famed tulip mania of the Dutch. So, to answer the titular question of focus: it depends on whom you ask. The more time goes on, the more obvious it becomes that not every crypto-skeptic can be won over, and that many will remain bearish on crypto and bullish on blockchain. Luckily, however, people such as Ms Stark are working on solutions that will bring crypto closer to the general public without separating it from its roots and the much-loved blockchain technology. It is in the best interest of the industry as a whole to believe that, while both sides have hard-working believers, the technological advancements of society may well move beyond our wildest dreams.",39.32000000000062,1

Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Bitcoin and the rest of digital currencies are purely falling on declining trader’s confidence in crypto markets, due to regulators crackdown and analysts concerns over the fair value. London-based Capital Economics succinctly explained the difference between cryptocurrency and the stock market selloff. The firm said, “We expect equity markets to fall as investors cotton on to the fact that rising U.S. interest rates will slow economic growth. But the main factor driving down the price of bitcoin is likely to be a realization that it is simply not a credible long-run alternative to conventional currencies.” Along with rebuffing the link between crypto and stock markets, London-based Capital Economics also raised questions over the underlying value of bitcoin. The firm calls bitcoin ‘worthless’ and expects BTC price to fall significantly from its current level. It’s undoubtedly true that bitcoin doesn’t have any fair value to support its price on exchanges; the cost of mining each coin stands below $1000 in some countries – which depends mainly on electricity prices. Bitcoin gained substantial momentum last year only on speculations and the massive growth in trading volume from criminal activities.

Bitcoin price recovered slightly from the lows of $6,500 that it hit during the weekend; BTC trades in the range of $7000 today after a death cross pattern failed to create any significant impact on price.  Analysts, however, expect bitcoin to fall another 50% in the days to come before creating a sustainable uptrend. Steve Bellotti of Digital Currency Holdings believes BTC price could hit the $3000 level, representing a decline of 50 – 60% from its current level. Steve Bellotti, also thinks that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will present better buying opportunities in the days to come. He said: “So, if you are patient, you are putting capital to work, this is a great opportunity versus right in December right before Christmas time where there was an awful lot of hype in the market, a lot of new retail customers joining every day etcetera and that has been taken out of the market. “So I think the market is much safer to enter into today. But we may not be at the extreme bottom yet,” he added. Reports of scams, frauds and illegal activities involving cryptocurrencies have shattered traders confidence in crypto markets over the past few months. Followed by an advertisement ban, Google announced a prohibition on crypto-mining browser extensions that are available for its ‘Chrome’ browser.

Most coins staged a decent recovery, but later they failed to gain upside momentum. At the moment, prices are correcting lower and trading near crucial support levels. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price traded towards the USD 7,400 and USD 7,500 resistance levels where it faced strong offers. BTC/USD failed to move past the mentioned resistances and started a downside correction.
It is down 0.8% to USD 7,280 with an immediate support at USD 7,200. The next major support on the downside awaits at USD 7,000, which must holds losses. If the price fails to stay above USD 7,000, the price may move back in a bearish zone.
On the other hand, bitcoin buyers must push the price above the USD 7,400 and USD 7,500 resistance levels to accelerate gains. Ethereum
Ethereum traded above the USD 400 level, but it could not break the USD 415 - USD 420 resistance zone. ETH/USD must stay above the USD 400 support to avoid a downside reaction.
Should there be a downside break below USD 400, the price could decline back towards the previous swing low at USD 560. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash failed to hold gains near the USD 700 and is currently down 0.85% to USD 680. BCH/USD must settle above the USD 700 to continue trading higher. On the downside, supports are near USD 660 and USD 650.
Ripple outperformed today and is currently trading 2.3% higher to USD 0.535. XRP/USD may continue to rise towards the USD 0.60 level, with supports on the downside at USD 0.52 and USD 0.50. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today’s best performer was Dragonchain (DRGN) as it climbed up by around 30% and broke the USD 0.80 resistance. There were a few positive development in the Dragonchain community, sparking buying interest.
Additionally, there were a few other altcoins which gained momentum today such as IOStoken (+25%), Ardor (+18%), Verge (+16%), Ontology (+14%) and Lisk (+11%).

Bulls are of the opinion that regulators scrutiny and advertisement bans would help crypto markets to streamline their operations, driven by regulators potential to vanish criminal activities and price manipulation techniques. Jack Tatar, the co-author of “Cryptoassets, said, “while recent bans on cryptocurrency advertising by Facebook, Twitter and Google hurt prices short term, they could legitimize the space.” Regulators role is turning vital in enhancing crypto markets credibility after reports of scams, frauds, and thefts in the last couple of months.

The selloff intensified in the previous two days when technical factors also started showing bearish trends for Bitcoin price and its future fundamentals. BTC price crashed at a double-digit rate to a 50-day low on Thursday, and the coin extended the decline into Friday trading. Bitcoin price is down more than 40% since hitting $11,700 early in March. Bitcoin price traded around $6,700 in early trade before paring some losses. The market capitalization of largest coin fumbled to $114 billion.  Technical factors on the price charts impacted Trader’s sentiments. Its 50-day moving average cut the 200-day moving average from the top, creating a long bearish trend for the price. Technical analysts predict a huge crash in bitcoin price after its 50-day MA collides with 200-day MA from above. Analysts say, “when you couple Death Cross trend with the fact that bitcoin has been trending steadily lower since the launch of futures, I think that it is a major negative.” Bulls, on the other hand, still of the opinion that cryptocurrency markets are on the verge of significant rebound – which would be similar to late 2017.   Brian Kelly said: “Bitcoin, just like the spot FX markets, follows technical’s closely. Therefore these support levels gain more importance.

The latest selloff isn’t due to ads bans, regulators clampdown or warnings; the downtrend was purely supported by traders concerns over the technical factors on price charts – market participants are predicting a massive crash in BTC price in the days to come, driven by a Death Cross trend. Bitcoin price declined more than 7% today, down 15% in the last seven days. TV analyst Abigail Doolittle said, ‘the “death cross” trading data for bitcoin, suggests that we could see bitcoin go all the way back below $1,000 per bitcoin”.  Source Image: bitcoincharts.com A death cross trend happens when the 50-day moving average (MA) cuts the 200-day MA from the top – suggesting a considerable drop in price based on technical factors.

Jim Iuorio’s concerns look undoubtedly true considering declining trading volumes and declining trader interest. Cryptocurrency markets are fumbling sharply over the last two months on regulators concerns and the use of digital currencies in illegal activities.

But Bitcoin is a great store of value. It works really well. It's kind of boring, because it's not the latest and most exciting project. But it also is one of the most liquid ways to get exposure to crypto.” In a Wednesday note, Lee wrote about the 10 best days for Bitcoin each year, comparing them to the traditional market: “Market timing is generally discouraged in traditional equity investing. If an investor missed out on the 10 best days (for S&P 500 [an American stock market index]) each year, the annualized return drops to 5.4% (ex-10 best), from 9.2%. In other words, the case for buy and hold in equities is the opportunity cost of missing out on the 10 best days.” So if an investor was to miss out on the 10 best days for Bitcoin, the annualized return drops 25% annually, Lee writes. On average, Bitcoin was down every year with the exclusion of the top 10 day gains, according to Fundstrat data. 2017, for instance, had a total of 12 days representing the full-year return of BTC. But the analysis for the S&P 500's performance goes back to 1954, while the nine-day average for the full-year gains of Bitcoin only goes back to 2013. This means it is unclear whether historical analysis on the decades-old stock market is appropriate for the far more volatile cryptocurrency that's only 9 years old. Bitcoin is trading at the breakeven cost of mining, at about USD 8,000, based on a model by Fundstrat, Bloomberg added. ""We see positive catalysts for Bitcoin later in 2018, including the clarification of regulatory hurdles,"" Fundstrat analysts wrote in the note. In addition, Bitcoin's current low selling price, gives investors who aren't familiar with cryptocurrency a chance to study the industry, rather than jumping in feet first, CNBC reported citing Lee.

With the crypto ad bans by major companies like Google, Facebook, and most recently Twitter, prices of cryptocurrencies have taken a beating as many people believe this to be the end. Have no fear, though, because this isn’t the end. Crypto will recover, and it will continue. People are still interested in the space. Just ask Wall Street or Bill Barhydt, the CEO of Abra. CNBC reported that a Wall Street analyst is for HODLing Bitcoin (BTC). Wall Street analyst Thomas Lee took a stock investing approach to Bitcoin and said that it is an “attractive buy.” Lee’s approach is that only a few days in the entire year account for the overall return on investment for something like Bitcoin: “The reason ‘buy and hold’ (or HODL) makes sense for BTC is that a handful of days each year account for the bulk of gains for BTC. For instance, in 2017, a total of 12 days represent the full-year return of BTC.” That means that if you’re looking to make a profit on Bitcoin, you need to HODL, through the good and the bad, to capture those days. However, can a stock investing approach really be applied to Bitcoin, when it’s been around for far less time than the decades-old stock market and is way more volatile? With less data to work from, it’s harder to generalize results. Be that as it may, Lee’s reasoning is something to keep in mind for those inclined to panic when Bitcoin drops.  Lee’s argument essentially comes down to this: be patient and HODL through to the good days. >> Ripple (XRP) joins forces with blockchain consortium Hyperledger Those good days may be approaching fast, according to Abra CEO Bill Barhydt. Abra runs a global digital wallet app where you can buy, store, and invest in up to 20 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. In an interview with Business Insider, Barhydt claims that Bitcoin is in store for another price rally – and soon. He believes that once institutional investors, like hedge funds and asset managers, start exploring cryptocurrency, Bitcoin prices, along with the rest of the crypto market, will recover. “That’s going to happen this year I think,” said Barhydt. He explained his reasoning: “I talk to hedge funds, high net worth individuals, even commodity speculators. They look at the volatility in the crypto markets and they see it as a huge opportunity. Once that happens, all hell will break loose. Once the floodgates are opened, they’re opened.” >> Coinbase adds ERC20 support – altcoins to come? Barhydt pointed out that the December crypto price rally of last year corresponded with Japanese financial institutions investing in cryptocurrencies. He believes this will happen again once the West gets going. “There really is zero large-scale institutional money from the west in crypto right now. That is happening in Japan. Once a large sizable chunk of Western institutional money starts to come in — watch out.” He also believes that the regulation currently cracking down on cryptocurrency markets will actually end up encouraging institutional investors to move into crypto. In a more regulated space, more institutional investors will want in, fearing loss and scam less. Already, there is evidence of some institutional involvement in crypto. Mark Yusko, the founder and CIO of Morgan Creek Capital, announced that the firm is looking to raise as much as $500 million to start a new crypto and blockchain exclusive hedge fund. The game CryptoKitties recently received $12 million in funding from a group of investors including Andreessen Horowitz. So all this panic, it may be for nothing. What do you think?

Bitcoin price traded towards the USD 7,720 level before starting an upside correction. BTC/USD is currently up around 0.7% to USD 7,950. 
On the upside, the pair may soon break the USD 8,000 resistance. However, there are many barriers on the upside such as USD 8,200 and USD 8,500. Only a close above the USD 8,500 level could clear the path for more gains.
On the downside, the USD 7,800 level is an initial support, followed by the last swing low of USD 7,720. Ethereum
Ethereum tumbled below the USD 450 level and tested the USD 440 level. It is currently trading flat near the USD 455 level. ETH/USD must gain upside momentum above USD 475 to start a decent recovery.
Above USD 475, the price may perhaps test the next major resistance at USD 500. On the downside, the USD 440-450 region is a crucial support in the near term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash failed to follow BTC and remains in a bearish zone below the USD 890 level. BCH/USD is down 2.66% to USD 884 and it remains at a risk of more declines. On the upside, the USD 900 and USD 920 levels are important resistances.

More than a 100 financial institutions were targeted over a period of 5 years; the criminals managed to get away with as much as EUR 10 million in each heist. According to Interpol and Spanish police statements, the leader of the gang is an Ukrainian called “Denis K.” who was arrested along with three suspected accomplices from Russia and Ukraine in the Spanish city of Alicante.  The group would gain access to the affected banking networks by sending phishing emails with malicious attachments to bank officials. The malware would then let the gang members gain control over affected hardware, allowing them to break into ATMs and use the machines to withdraw unlimited sums of money. According to the authorities, although the attacks happened to financial institutions worldwide, almost all Russian banks were affected and about 50 of them did lose money in the attacks. The AP also reports that the criminals did not spend their ill-gained money, instead opting for changing it into bitcoin, which was then used for buying different assets, including real estate and vehicles in Spain.

Now fans of both crypto and puzzles get the best of both worlds with crypto puzzles. Solving the puzzle gives you the key to the wallet with the reward, to be claimed by the fastest brain in the race. On Friday, Gizmodo reported the story of an artist, Andy Bauch, with his abstract artwork in which he hid the private key to a crypto-wallet with various types and amounts of cryptocurrency. He bought amounts of bitcoin, litecoin, and other altcoins in 2016 and put them in different digital wallets. Each wallet is encrypted with a private key, consisting of letters and numbers, which are visually represented in his works. Buying a piece of his art does not mean that you own the private key, as anyone who figures out the code will be able to take the money for themselves. However, Bauch told Gizmodo that he will give the purchaser of any painting “a hint.” He added, “A lot of the work that I’m doing is trying to span this gap that often exists between new technology and humanity.” As of right now, all of the crypto appears to still be in each wallet, meaning that either no one has cracked any of the codes, or just not taken the money yet. Another visual puzzle, perhaps the best-known of them, was The Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto, a visual puzzle associated with the Bitcoin address 1FLAMEN6 that was created in 2015 with 5 BTC locked in. It was finally solved three years later, having previously been dubbed “fiendishly difficult”, by a programmer who hadn’t even heard of it until a month before finally cracking it. There are still more Bitcoin puzzles for aficionados to solve. For example, a tiny community on Reddit, with only 199 subscribers, offers a place for anyone who wants to share their puzzle with the world, or solve someone else’s. The challenges range from trivia games to scavenger hunts, with every title pointing out the difficulty level of the challenge and the reward. Another example is a video game called MonteCrypto: The Bitcoin Enigma, released in February. Described as “a maze filled with 24 mind-bending puzzles”, it promises one Bitcoin for the person who completes it first. It offers the possibility of working either alone or with others, as well as leading others to dead ends to slow them down. The Steam page of this game asks simply, “How much will players be willing to share, how much will they be able to compromise and who will claim access to the final vault of Montecrypto?” The game’s mysterious development team, Gem Rose Accent, hasn’t produced any other games, and they have said they wouldn’t reveal their identities until the prize is claimed. It would seem that the prize has either still not been claimed or simply not moved yet from the address. Whichever of these tickles your fancy, go for it - the possibilities are endless.

Dorsey, who himself is a noted Bitcoin investor, thinks Bitcoin will overtake the dollar in importance as it becomes the single global currency of the internet within a decade. He was revealed as a funder of Lightning Labs, which specialises in a technology that can potentially make Bitcoin cheaper and faster to use. He helped raise around USD 2.5 million for the startup that promises scalability, low fees and faster transaction times in a bid for Bitcoin adoption. He does admit that Bitcoin “does not have the capabilities right now to become an effective currency,” due to scaling issues. But he does believe that, with new technologies and innovations, those problems will soon fade: “It’s slow and it’s costly, but as more and more people have it, those things go away. There are newer technologies that build off of blockchain and make it more approachable.” Dorsey has been a vocal supporter for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general for a while now. His payment company Square introduced Bitcoin trading earlier this year. He also said in a conference call with Market Watch, “Bitcoin, for us, is not stopping at buying and selling. We do believe that this is a transformational technology for our industry, and we want to learn as quickly as possible.” However, Twitter may prohibit advertisements for initial coin offerings (ICOs), token sales, and cryptocurrency wallets globally in two weeks, as previously reported.

Morgan Stanley strategist Sheena Shah sees enormous resemblances between the cryptocurrency market behavior and the dot-com bubble – the only exception being the 15 times higher growth in bitcoin price. Sheena Shah has based its prediction on following assumptions:  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Undoubtedly Morgan Stanley’s strategist is certainly right. Shah has outlined several key factors that are similar to the dot-com bubble. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are moving on speculation, and their trading volume continues declining with sideways movement. It’s also true that increasing trading volume doesn’t suggest higher trader interest; the higher volume could also be an indication of higher selling activities.   “Rising trade volumes are thus not an indication of more investor activity but instead a rush to get out,” Sheena Shah said. However, the strategist didn’t look at the price performance of NASDAQ after the dot-com bubble burst. NASDAQ recovered steadily at the beginning of 2003 following a two year of downward trends. NASDAQ currently stands around 7344 points, significantly higher from the 5000 points NASDAQ had hit during the peak of the dot-com bubble. In case of cryptocurrencies, it’s too early to predict the future price performance of bitcoin and other digital currencies. The market forces have refused to consider them as a medium of exchange and an alternative currency, and they have several valid reasons to support their denouncement – the lack of fair value is amongst the biggest reason for their criticisms.     Featured Image: Twitter ",293.7999999999993,1

An immediate support is at USD 500. If the pair fails to hold the stated USD 500 support, there could be an increase in selling pressure. The next important support is at USD 460. On the upside, the USD 540 and 550 levels remain key barriers for further recoveries. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is stable and is trading above the USD 940 and 950 support levels. BCH/USD has to move past the USD 1,000 resistance to gains strength. A failure to hold the USD 940 support may perhaps push the price toward USD 900.
Ripple is finally showing a few positive signs with a close above the USD 0.65 level. However, a break and close above the USD 0.70 and USD 0.75 resistance levels is must for further upsides. Other Altcoins Market Today

Meanwhile, the idea of correlating cryptocurrencies with Giffen goods seems to be undoubtedly true. Giffen goods are products that people consume more when prices are higher, contrary to the demand and supply principle. Cryptocurrencies drive higher demand and interest when its price increases while the demand for digital currencies declines with the decay in prices. The demand for cryptocurrencies increased substantially in the final two months of last year when its price was soaring at a robust pace. However, regulators interference and harsh comments from market forces pulled back Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital currencies from their all-time high; the decline in prices has also lowered trader’s interest towards cryptocurrencies. Google trends show that searches for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies tanked by 80% to the lowest level in the last five months, while total confirm transactions are declining at a strong pace over the previous two months. Traders lost their confidence in cryptocurrencies after regulators, and key market players strongly criticized them on various grounds, including the lack of underlying value, failure to work as a medium of exchange and its uses in illegal activities. Followed by Facebook and Google, Twitter has also been planning to ban cryptocurrency related ads; they believe the unregulated cryptocurrency ads are harmful to consumers. >>Bitcoin Price Watch – Returns to $8,500 Bitcoin price regained momentum on Monday after hitting $7000 level on Sunday; the uptrend in price was supported by a statement from G20 Financial Stability Board chairman – who believe cryptocurrencies aren’t in a position to threaten the financial stability of the world. FBS members are likely to talk about digital currencies, but the chairman had ruled out the establishment of new regulatory policies for crypto markets during the summit.

They revealed a series of multi-million dollar sales of Bitcoins.  According to the documents, its bankruptcy trustee, Mr. Nobuaki Kobayashi had claimed to be the author of those sales. The document with Kobayashi’s textual words read as follows: “Between the 9th creditors’ (September 27, 2017) meeting and this creditors’ meeting (On March 7, 2018), with the permission of the court, I sold a certain amount of BTC and bitcoin cash (“BCC”) that belonged to the bankruptcy estate. The quantities sold and the amount paid into the bankrupt trustee’s account are shown below.” The multi-million dollar sales coincided with the exact time that Bitcoin prices fell the most in recent months. According to a Reddit forum sales were made from a series of wallets traceable to Mt.Gox which resulted in, or happened curiously close to, the largest and most atypical bearish candles of the month.  However, while some consider the impact to be strong, other research says otherwise: According to Coin Telegraph there is no reason to become alarmists: “The data shows us that Kobayashi’s actions were not as significant to the price of Bitcoin in the short run as some individuals believed they were. That being said, the amount of cryptocurrency under Kobayashi’s management could have the ability to create a panic that causes investors to sell off their cryptocurrency – especially if they get a glimpse at a sell wall created by Kobayashi.”  After an intense debate, marked above all by Mr. Nobuaki’s secrecy, the silence was broken. In a document published on the Mt.Gox website known as Q&A regarding 10th Creditors’ Meeting Report, Mr. Nobuaki answers a series of questions relating to the sale of cryptocurrencies, with a special focus on his multi-million dollar sale of BTC and BCH. According to the report, the whale denies any responsibility for the fall in bitcoin prices, as it mentions that sales, in addition to being made separately and in quantities that did not cause sell walls, had other characteristics that would give a minimal impact to the price of bitcoin: He also mentions that his trade was not impulsive, but rather that he had expert advice on the subject (without specifying who these would be). Similarly, although the previous paragraph checks the cooperation with an Exchange, it should also be noted that the sales did not use this type of platform to be completed. He didn’t give any more details about these transactions: “Following consultation with cryptocurrency experts, I sold BTC and BCC, not by an ordinary sale through the BTC/BCC exchange, but in a manner that would avoid affecting the market price, while ensuring the security of the transaction to the extent possible. Therefore, I believe that the sale of BTC and BCC by us did not affect their market prices.” If his words are right, the bearish behavior may be natural, but he is already beginning to have critics who think that Mt Nobuaki is just defending himself. Fair practice that could give Holders peace of mind that their investment won’t fall as a result of some manipulation. In the end, everyone is free to make their interpretations, but the truth is that it now becomes easier to make an objective statement when one can know the trustee’s approach when negotiating.  ",286.52999999999884,1

Bitcoin price was under a lot of pressure this past week and every upward correction faced sellers. BTC/USD settled below the USD 9,000 pivot level and even declined toward USD 7,000.
A low was formed near USD 7,320 before a major upward correction was initiated. The price has recovered by roughly USD 800 and is currently trading 6.8% higher to USD 8,200.
Weekly supports on the downside are at USD 8,000 and USD 7,300. If the price fails to move past USD 8,500 and USD 9,000 resistance levels this week, it could resume its decline toward USD 7,300. Ethereum
Ethereum was one of the worst performers among the top five cryptocurrencies. It tumbled below the USD 620 and USD 500 support levels and traded toward USD 450.
Later, the market sentiment improved and ETH/USD started a decent recovery. It is currently trading above the USD 500 level with weekly resistances on the upside at USD 550 and USD 600. Above USD 600, the price may move back in a positive zone. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash was comparatively stable this past week, but buyers failed to contain losses below the USD 1,000 support. BCH/USD tested the USD 850 support before recovering. It is currently trading 3% higher to USD 925, with resistances at USD 950 and 1,000.

Crypto markets are substantially responsive to market reports, and they can add or wipe billions of dollars off the board in a single day alone – forcing Bitcoin (BTC) investors to keep an eye on the price charts several times a day to see where their investments stand. “With other speculative investments, like private equity and venture capital, you can’t check your phone every five minutes,” Jim Smigiel said. With cryptocurrencies, “you’re able to track the minute-by-minute value of it.” Bitcoin price lost close to $2000 since the start of this week following reports regarding increasing crackdown and advertisement related ban from Google.

The market capitalization currently hovers around 325 billion, down more than 60% from the value it hit at the beginning of the year. The price volatility extended on Friday; Bitcoin and the rest of top ten virtual currencies regained some momentum after hitting the one month low of $7,700 on Thursday. Though there wasn’t any supportive news for digital currencies, the prices are increasing on speculations that the price has found support below $8000. Though the market opinion is divided about the future of cryptocurrencies, some analysts believe BTC prices are likely to crash below the $6000 level after the corrective rally – they have based their opinion entirely on technical aspects of the BTC price chart. “When sentiment is this weak, the market is increasingly ’fire, ready, aim’ — meaning, any headline today is likely to trigger selling,” Fundstrat analysts including Tom Lee and Robert Sluymer wrote. Market dynamics are getting tougher for crypto markets following increasing concerns over the scams and illegal practices using cryptocurrencies.

What does it mean? And is it already for everyone? Bitcoin has seen its share of problems throughout its relatively brief history, but mostly in the way it was simply not viable as an actual currency due to its high transaction fees and long confirmation times.  Lightning Network worked tirelessly to change that. The idea is that transacting and settling would be done off-blockchain, so the fees are low and thanks to the implementation of smart contracts for security, the payments can be instant - no waiting time for block confirmation. Other than these two, another important factor is its scalability, which is supposed to make it possible for millions to billions of transactions per second to take place across the network.  The beta release now makes available what investors and project leads say is the first thoroughly tested version of the tech to date. This now means that users can leverage lnd to send and receive Bitcoin and Litecoin off-blockchain.  Not for everyone “Bitcoin enthusiasts have gotten excited about this, merchants are excited about this. It feels like we’re right on the edge of mass cryptocurrency adoption,” Elizabeth Stark, Lightning Labs CEO, told Bloomberg.  However, she urges caution because a beta is far from a finished product. “This is still an early beta version aimed at developers and advanced users. As with any early software there will still be bugs. Users shouldn't be putting more money on Lightning right now than they are willing to lose,” Stark told Bitcoin Magazine. The target demographic for the release is developers and ""advanced users"" who are able to run a full node and use lnd’s command-line interface. The safety measures for the beta include limitations of how much people can send: this is now capped at around USD 1,400 worth per channel, or around USD 400 per payment. Spirits are high and excitement for reaching this milestone is not showing signs of retreating in the too-near future. Ben Davenport, CTO at BitGo and Lightning Network's investor, said to Coindesk, “It's something the entire community has been focused on and working towards for the better part of two years now. It's really the culmination of a lot of work by many people, not just Lightning Labs. ... We see it as a very important piece of the scaling solution for Bitcoin, and perhaps other digital currencies as well.” It was also revealed that Lightning Labs has raised USD 2.5 million from nearly a dozen investors, many of them big names in the industry such as Litecoin creator Charlie Lee; BitGo CTO Ben Davenport; Square and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey; former PayPal COO and Yammer founder David Sacks; Tesla and SpaceX angel investor Bill Lee; head of Square Capital and Square’s People Lead Jacqueline Reses; Eventbrite co-founder Kevin Hartz; Robinhood co-founder Vlad Tenev; and The Hive, Digital Currency Group and others. Lightning Network is not the only one working on ways to make Bitcoin more accessible as a payment system. SegWit, short for Segregated Witness, is also gaining traction as the number of transactions using it doubled to more than 30% of the total in the past month. Bitcoin transaction fees have plummeted in part thanks to this, but the total number of transactions has also declined. Both lnd and SegWit may become the main reasons for all-time lows in terms of fees, other than leading the crypto industry into a whole new era.",15.44000000000051,1

The price recovered by more than USD 500, but it seems like buyers are lacking momentum. Similarly, there was a decent recovery in all major altcoins such as ethereum, bitcoin cash and ripple. However, they seem to be facing many resistances on the upside, which are capping further recoveries. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price started an upward correction from the USD 7,650 low. BTC/USD broke the USD 8,000 resistance and traded towards the USD 8,400 level. The stated USD 8,400 level was a support earlier and this time it prevented the current upside move.
The pair retreated and is currently trading around 0.8% down to USD 8,100. An initial support on the downside is at USD 8,000. If the price fails to stay above USD 8,000, there could a retest of the last low of USD 7,650.
On the upside, the price has to move past the USD 8,400 and USD 8,500 resistance levels to recover further. Ethereum
Ethereum recovered from the USD 570 low, but it is struggling a great deal to stay above the USD 600-610 zone. ETH/USD traded as high as USD 621 and is currently down 2.1% to USD 595.
If the price has to recover towards USD 700, it must surpass the USD 625 and USD 630 resistance levels. On the downside, the last low near USD 570 is a short-term support followed by USD 560. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is under pressure since it failed to break the USD 950 resistance. BCH/USD is down 3.3% to USD 903 and it may continue to move down if it fails to stay above USD 900.
Ripple recovered a few points and moved above USD 0.70. However, the XRP/USD pair could not hold gains above USD 0.70 and is currently trading down 1.7% to USD 0.691. It may continue to decline towards the USD 0.68 level. Other Altcoins Market Today

Coinfloor, a London-based cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it would be starting its own bitcoin futures exchanged named CoinfloorEX. This new exchange will offer bitcoin futures “at scale” through their own specific contracts and operational controls. The futures contracts are available to traders, hedge funds, and miners. CoinfloorEX claims they will offer the first “physically delivered cryptocurrency futures contracts”, designed specifically to protect investors from price slippage on positions at the time of settlement. The settlements made by CoinfloorEX will be based on physical delivery rather than the index price that’s across all other exchanges, which in turn provides true pricing transparency. >> Day One of Crypto Madness The company goes into further details in the official statement saying: “Access to Coinfloor’s spot exchange enables investors to easily convert Bitcoin to Fiat currency post-physical delivery, creating opportunities for longer-term currency appreciation or through meeting Bitcoin-denominated obligations.” The development team behind this project is taking security as a top priority, which is necessary given the number of hacks that have occurred as of late.

Bitcoin price tumbled and broke a couple of important support levels such as USD 9,000 and USD 8,600. The decline in BTC/USD was nasty as the pair even surpassed the USD 8,000 level.
The pair traded as low as USD 7,650 and it is currently down 9.2% to USD 8,180. It seems like the price is in a recovery mode, but it could face resistances on the upside such as USD 8,400 and USD 8,500.
Above USD 8,500, the broken supports at USD 8,800 and USD 9,000 are major barriers. On the downside, a decent support is forming around USD 8,000. If the price breaks down below USD 8,000, it could retest the recent low of USD 7,650. Ethereum
Ethereum declined heavily and broke the USD 650 and 600 support levels. The ETH/USD pair traded as low as USD 570 and it is currently correcting higher.

The past three sessions were mostly quiet since bitcoin price traded in a tiny range and did not make an upside move above USD 9,500 resistance. 
On the positive note, there was no downside break below the USD 9,000 and USD 8,800 support levels. As long as the pair is above the stated USD 8,800 support, it could slowly rise to USD 9,500.
Above USD 9,500, the USD 9,600 is a key resistance on the way to USD 10,000. On the flip side, a break below the USD 8,800 support may perhaps kick start a fresh downside wave towards USD 8,200. Ethereum
Ethereum seems to be struggling and it is currently trading below the USD 700 support. The current price action in ETH/USD points an increase in selling pressure from the USD 705-710 resistance region.
If the pair fails to stay above an important support at USD 680, there can be a sharp downside move. A recovery could start if ETH buyers succeed in pushing the price back above the USD 710 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is trading slightly higher towards USD 1,050 and is currently gaining 1%. On the downside, the USD 1,020 support is acting as a major buy zone. To the topside, the USD 1,050 and 1,080 are key resistances.

Gox dump by Nobuaki Kobayashi, a Tokyo attorney and bankruptcy trustee for Mt Gox, is what some people believe brought the cryptocurrency market down recently - and he’s not even done yet. Kobayashi reportedly has another USD 1.9 billion to offload. But the next court hearing for the Mt. Gox bankruptcy is scheduled for September 18th, 2018, so it is likely that the attorney will not be able to get rid of the remaining coins until then - which could be a good thing for the Bitcoin price. Disclosures in Kobayashi's report on the Mt. Gox website suggest his Bitcoin sales since September fetched the equivalent of USD 10,105 on average. But the part that’s got everyone red-faced with rage is when Bitcoin investor Alistair Milne pointed out on Twitter that over half of the Bitcoin the attorney sold was transferred to an exchange on February 5. It was the day before Bitcoin hit a three-month low of close to USD 6,000 - so traders are concerned that he was effectively the one who brought it down. Exactly how unhappy users were with this situation is best seen on social media. People were venting on Reddit, with ideas what could have been done instead - like auctioning bitcoin off like it is often done in these cases, or release the same number of coins every day at a rate the market can absorb. In other threads, the top comments were on par with, “Just give the people their money in BTC and let them decide what to do with it. This is horsesh*t.” Any proceeds left after Mt. Gox's creditors are paid will go to Mark Karpeles, the founder of the infamous bitcoin exchange. This is another issue for the community, as it believes that Karpeles, facing charges of embezzlement and data manipulation and currently on bail from prison, should not reap any benefits from Mt. Gox’s fall. However, Chuck Jones, a contributor at Forbes, argues that blaming the Mt. Gox offload for the recent price drops makes no sense, saying that it seems “highly unlikely that this selling would have had much impact on the market.” He says that, “Since the sales were spread out over more than a month and at most represented 1.2% of a days trading volume, I find it hard to believe that Mt Gox created the decline in Bitcoin’s price.” He further added that the reason for the price drops could have been Bitcoin’s price “getting ahead of itself” or the fact that some countries went against crypto, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission coming out with statements in January. In short - his opinion is that everything except for this offload is the reason for the price drop. Meanwhile, Jim Edwards, an editor-in-chief of Business Insider UK, agrees: “That anger is misplaced, however. All they are complaining about is the fundamental condition of Bitcoin itself. They are complaining about the clearing price of supply and demand. They are ridiculous.” The truth, however, may just be in the middle of these warring opinions. Rare are the instances where there is a single, obvious reason for price fluctuations. It is usually a combination of common themes, such as public perception, panic selling and security breaches. In this case, it is highly unlikely that Mt Gox was the sole reason for the price drop - but arguing that it did not contribute to it doesn’t seem quite right either.",21.80999999999949,1

Exactly why we’re mocking them this time remains unknown, but the Lil Windex song may have seemed proof that BCH is as much a joke as its theme song. So the newest topic is the claim that it has less transactions than Dogecoin. Twitter user @Whalepool points this out in a controversial tweet. Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency introduced as a “joke currency” to prove people would buy anything. While there are few mainstream commercial applications, it has gained traction as an Internet tipping system, in which social media users grant Dogecoin tips to other users for providing interesting or noteworthy content. Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, has been called the “real Bitcoin” by its endorsers in the community, being the result of a prolonged disagreement on how to handle the Bitcoin scalability problem. Bitcoin Cash fans argue that it is superior to the original Bitcoin because of its greater transaction speed, thus more likely to be used by merchants and for transactions. This has been dubbed the crypto “civil war”, where both sides claim that “this is what Satoshi would have wanted!”, despite nobody really knowing anything about Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. Their superiority doesn’t really show right now. The numbers at Bitinfocharts.com do not lie: in the past two months, only rarely did the number of Bitcoin Cash transactions exceed that of Dogecoin transactions, and the two cannot even compete with Litecoin most of the time. But before that, BCH traded at five times the number of Dogecoin transactions - a number that cannot be overseen, as the graph in the tweet was heavily taken out of full context. This could arguably be because Bitcoin Cash is significantly younger than the two - but its merit in transaction speed may be lost on traders as they obviously go for even the jokester’s Dogecoin more often than BCH. How Bitcoin’s “younger brother” will mark its comeback remains to be seen, as well as whether it will ever get out of its older brother’s shadow.",21.80999999999949,1

Prices are down roughly 4.6% and are showing a few negative signs. It seems like there could be an extended downside correction before prices start an upward move. Bitcoin
Yesterday, bitcoin price failed to move above the USD 9,800 and 10,000 resistance levels. As a result, the BTC/USD pair started a downward move and trade below the USD 9,500 and 9,200 support levels.
It even traded below USD 9,000, but later recovered and is currently trading around 5.8% lower to USD 9,240. On the upside, the broken support levels at USD 9,300 and 9,500 may perhaps as resistances.
On the downside, the USD 9,000 level remains a major support. If the price closes below USD 9,000, there could be more declines towards USD 8,500. Ethereum
Ethereum was under pressure as it struggled to hold the USD 720 support. It declined and is currently finding it difficult to remain above the USD 700 support.
ETH/USD is trading 4.5% lower to USD 703. It may trade in a range above USD 675 for a few hours before it makes the next move. Below USD 700, the price may trade back towards USD 675. On the upside, a break above USD 725 is needed for a push towards USD 750. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash struggled a lot and declined 6.5% to USD 1,035. It failed not hold gains above the USD 1,100 and 1,080 supports and declined. Going forward, BCH/USD has to stay above USD 1,000 to avoid further losses.
Ripple’s bad run continues as it could not move above the USD 0.85 level. XRP/USD is currently down 4.4% to USD 0.79. It must move above USD 0.82 and USD 0.85 to start a fresh upside move. Other Altcoins Market Today
NEM cryptocurrency did very well today and gained around 20.8% to trade above the USD 0.40 resistance. It is currently trading near USD 0.44, with the next resistance at USD 0.50. There were a few positive developments from the NEM community and developers, which lifted the market sentiment. To sum up, the current market sentiment is slightly bearish.

It is not uncommon for currency traders to use adopted ForEx market indicators such as MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Indicators or Fibonacci’s Retracements, but the truth is that many of these methodologies were created for traditional markets and may not be entirely right for crypto-trading. This has led many economists and “old-school” investors to see investments in cryptocurrencies more as a gamble rather than a real capital investment.  However, this seems to be changing, with the emergence of specialized studies, which have led to improved trading strategies. One that has emerged recently in blogs and news sites is the one created by the well-known Bitcoin Strategist and strong bullish investor Thomas Lee: the Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI) Although the methodology applied or the mathematical formula for its determination has not been disclosed, the indicator seeks to explain the market’s feeling regarding bitcoins ownership and how motivated a person would be to sell what he has. According to MarketWatch: “The Bitcoin Misery Index is a measure of consistency in the price of the No. 1 digital asset, bitcoin BTCUSD, +7.07% over the past 90 days, using the end of day performance (up-day or down-day) and volatility. In other words, it is a measure of momentum in the asset, equivalent to an oversold-overbought indicator. Market technicians often gauge “overbought” or “oversold” conditions based on measures of price momentum.” The results are given on a scale of 0 – 100, where 0 is “absolutely miserable” (bitcoin holders are “absolutely” willing to give away all their bitcoin) and 100 is “absolutely happy” (where no price in the world would be enough to motivate bitcoin holders to sell their coins). Of course in economics, the “absolute” signs indicators do not exist, but it’s easy to conclude that in general terms, Tom Lee developed an indicator, which analyzes the behavior and characteristics of the bitcoin to produce a more accurate result than other similar indexes. The indicator created by FondStrat’s owner shows a negative result. That is to say, the lower the number, the bigger the misery /, The bigger the number, the lower the misery)  In the world of trading there are already other similar indicators such as the RSI (Relative Strength Index) which, as stated by Investopedia “compares the magnitude of recent gains and losses over a specified time period to measure speed and change of price movements of a security” , and the MACD which is “a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of prices”. Investors often use these indicators in an attempt to find areas where trend shifts allow them to raise money, either by buying cheaply and then selling expensive in front of a bullish trend or by selling at the start of a bearish trend to buy more goods with the same amount of money. “When the bitcoin misery index is at’ misery’ (below 27), bitcoin sees the best 12-month performance,” Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Thomas Lee said in an interview with CNBC “A signal is generated about every year.” Right now the indicator has a result of 18.8, its lowest since Sept. 6, 2011. And according to an interview with Thomas Lee,“The last four times this was below 27… there was not a single instance with bitcoin not up 12 months later.”  When comparing the results with the traditional indicators, you can see that right now is an excellent time to invest in Bitcoins. All signs point to the same results. After the price manipulation resulting from an atypical selling of 400 Million Dollars by Mt. Gox Bankruptcy Trustee, Mr. Nobuaki Kobayashi, prices should return to their natural behavior.  According to a report published by Forbes “Lee’s Bitcoin Misery Index may be more useful than the traditional RSI and MACD indicators for Bitcoin since he has compiled some additional information to go along with his analysis. Also, Bitcoin’s price was relatively low until 2017, so RSI and MACD may not have enough historical data to be as accurate vs. when they are applied to securities having a longer track record. That being said both the RSI, the top portion of the graph below, and the MACD, the bottom portion, indicate that Bitcoin is in a bit of an oversold condition.”  >>Mt.Gox Bankruptcy Trustee sells $400million USD in BTC; Causes Market To Drop Almost 40% So remember: “Do not invest more than you can afford to lose” but in case you do have money to invest, check out the Bitcoin Misery Index and take advantage of the ‘misery’ of bitcoin holders now and (very likely) profit by the end of the year.

Later, the market stabilized and started recovering. Bitcoin corrected higher after forming a base above USD 8,400. Similarly, altcoins recovered sharply as the market sentiment improved during the past few hours. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently trading 13.8% higher from the USD 8,532 low. More importantly, the BTC/USD pair is now trading above the USD 9,500 support, which could ignite more upsides.
On the upside, the price is facing an immediate resistance at USD 10,000. A push above the mentioned resistance may perhaps boost the bullish market sentiment and the price could trade towards USD 10,500. 
On the downside, the USD 9,500 level is a major support. A break below USD 9,500 will most likely push the price back towards USD 9,000. Ethereum
Ethereum gained traction after forming a base above the USD 650 level. ETH/USD recovered and traded above the USD 700 resistance. It is currently up 7.8% to USD 738. 
It seems to be struggling to break the USD 750 resistance. A break above the USD 750 level may call for further gains towards the USD 800 level. On the downside, supports are at USD 700 and 680. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash was one of the best performers as it recovered by around 14% today and it is currently trading at USD 1,130. It has to clear a strong resistance at USD 1,150 to continue its recovery.
Ripple failed to capitalize and it seems to be struggling to move past USD 0.85. XRP/USD is currently trading around 3.8% higher to USD 0.829 and is facing a major resistance at USD 0.85. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, IOStoken,  a decentralized internet of services platform, gained heavy bids and surged by around 22.6%. IOST price broke the USD 0.020 resistance and is currently trading in a positive zone. There was no particular reason for the recent jump, but one person on reddit reported that there were some false posts regarding McDonald’s and Amazon, which were removed later.

The price variation of Bitcoin in the last three months alone is a virtual roller coaster; the price was $8k in November, 20k in December (19898.8$ to be more accurate) but then back to $9k in January. Such level of risk has generated a universal mantra in the community: “Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose”. However, since the crypto market is still a growing niche, with a constant number of new adopters every day, it is still difficult to make predictions although for now, the future looks promising. It is precisely this accelerated growth that has made it possible for so many people to make a profit uncomparable with any other investment. Some early adopters have even become millionaires without doing absolutely nothing more than waiting (or HODL). These people who for one reason or another have large amounts of money (or some token as the case may be) are known as “whales” and have the power to manipulate the market. Have you ever tried to buy a token and come across a “wall” that prevents you from buying it at a reasonable price because someone has placed an enormous purchase order for a price lower than yours?…  Did you see the order magically vanishing shortly afterward? This is known as a buy/sell wall. Equally, the actions taken by these whales affect traders globally, since when they sell or buy orders as a result of their massive operations, prices can skyrocket or plummet in a matter of minutes. In February someone bought almost 400 Million in Bitcoin, generating an increase of nearly 50% in its overall price.  His operations stored on an address which today has more than 92000 Bitcoins, had a positive result for the WHOLE market, thanks to a rebound in the price trend. On March 6, 2018, the Bitcoin reached a historic low, touching the $6000 mark. No one knew the apparent reason, but with the publication of an official report by Mr. Nobuaki Kobayashi, Bankruptcy Trustee of the now-defunct Mt. Gox, clear explanation arose for those who could make the figures: “Between the 9th creditors’ (September 27, 2017) meeting and this creditors’ meeting (On March 7, 2018), with the permission of the court, I sold a certain amount of BTC and bitcoin cash (“BCC”) that belonged to the bankruptcy estate. The quantities sold and the amount paid into the bankrupt trustee’s account are shown below” These operations totaled approximately U. S. 402,797975 million dollars according to the Google Exchange Rate of 1 Japanese yen = 0.00937 U.S. dollars The report concludes with a few words that explain the speculative behavior of every trader and the influence that a whale can have on the markets. “I made efforts to sell BTC and BCC at as high a price as possible in light of the market price of BTC and BCC at the time of the sale.” A Reddit user was able to track the movements made with the conclusion that the selling was not “gradual” but very quick instead. This led to an abrupt drop in Bitcoin prices that were reflected in a bearish trend for most of the other altcoins. Twitter user Matt Odell correlated the movements with bitcoin behavior. Results speak for themselves.  However, we have to wait. The crypto trading system must be taken very objectively in order not to make hasty decisions. Weak-handers usually lose, this is something to take into consideration after identifying three critical points of Mr. Nobuaki’s report: 1) Nobuaki Kobayashi’s power of decision and resource management “Unless the court makes a new decision, the bankruptcy proceedings will proceed as before, and I, as the bankruptcy trustee, continue to have the right to administer and dispose of the bankruptcy estate as before.” 2) The number of resources he manages. If with 35000 BTC an adverse reaction was generated, it is essential to be aware that he has the resources to do it again, producing more significant results. “The amount of BTC managed by the bankruptcy estate as of March 5, 2018, is 166,344.35827254 BTC… The amount of BCC managed by the bankruptcy estate as of March 5, 2018, is 168,177.35927254 BCC.”  3) The expressed willingness to do so again when deemed appropriate “I plan to consult with the court and determine further sale of BTC and BCC.” >>Ripple CEO: Cryptocurrencies Must Work With Government Regulations So far there has not been an official statement from Mr. Nobuaki Kobayashi or the courts of law, but social networks have been on fire since the information came out. Mainly because there is a conflict of interest between the users of the platform and Kobayashi as Mt.Gox representative since the number of bitcoins and altcoins that the users deposited in the exchange house have revalued a lot after Mt.Gox initiated the bankruptcy legal proceeding. Therefore, they expect to be reimbursed for their investment in cryptocurrency and not in FIAT money as Mr. Nobuaki’s strategy seems to pretend.  Featured Image: Twitter",-77.14000000000124,0

The inscrutable rapper is believed to hail from British Columbia, although very little is truly known about him, other than that he once said, “I idolize birds.” He is the one to thank for the Bitcoin Ca$h song that seems to have the makings of a viral hit, if only because of how strange it is. Over three verses, Bitcoin Ca$h tells the story of a young Lil Windex, probably fictionalized, who goes from a dead-end job cleaning windows, to being hard-sold by a guy in a cafe who explains the details (and we mean absolute details!) of crypto mining, to obtaining ludicrous personal wealth. Since showing his crypto stash off would not look too great in a music video, he is throwing around fiat currency, we’re guessing after he cashed his BCH out. His portfolio remains a mystery, but he does take a hard stance on Bitcoin core - the BCH community’s nickname for the original Bitcoin - saying that, “Hey f*ck Bitcoin core. You’re just a buncha names. We the BCH gang. We run this game.” The only thing that’s telling us is that he certainly doesn’t own any BTC. If you’re wondering whether it’s a joke or serious, or was it sponsored by BCH supporters - we don’t know either. Nobody does, and we’re not even sure Lil Windex knows.

There was hardly any recovery in the market following yesterday’s decline. At present, sellers are still in control and there are no signs of a short-term recovery. The current move is mostly a technical breakdown, which could extend in the near term. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is about to register one of the worst weeks of 2018. It is down around 25% this week and it recently broke a couple of important support levels such as USD 10,000 and 9,000.
BTC/USD pair is currently down 13.5% to USD 8,643. Today’s low was USD 8,329 and the current correction wave is struggling to gain momentum. It seems like the price may resume its downside in the near term and it could even break the recent low of USD 8,329.
On the downside, the next major support is at USD 8,000. On the upside, resistances are at USD 8,880 and 9,000. Ethereum
Ethereum followed bitcoin and declined sharply below the USD 650 level. ETH/USD traded towards USD 640 before starting a recovery. The pair is currently losing 12.7% and is struggling near the USD 666 level.
On the downside supports are at USD 650 and 640. A break below the USD 640 support may perhaps push the price towards the USD 600 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash traded close to the USD 900 level and is currently trading well below the USD 1,000 level. BCH/USD declined 13.2% to USD 956. It remains in a bearish zone as long as it is below USD 1,000.
Ripple tumbled and moved below the USD 0.80 level. XRP/USD’s struggle to move higher continues and the current market decline has increased bearish pressures. Other Altcoins Market Today

The main reason was phishing and attempted stealing incident on a major cryptocurrency exchange – Binance. However, the exchange released a statement mentioning that all funds are safe. Later, the company resumed withdrawals as well.   Bitcoin
Bitcoin price dropped heavily and broke a major support area at USD 10,000. It even surpassed the USD 9,600 support and traded towards the USD 9,400 level. 
Later, the market calmed down and BTC/USD recovered. However, the pair is still down around 5.3% to USD 9,920. It has to move back above the USD 10,000 level to recover further.
If the pair fails to move above USD 10,000, it could retest the USD 9,600 support. On the upside, above USD 10,000, the price may perhaps move towards USD 10,500. Ethereum
Ethereum traded sharply lower and broke the USD 750 support. It traded close to the USD 700 level before starting an upside correction.
ETH/USD is currently trading 3.4% down to USD 758. It may continue to move higher, but it will most likely find a strong selling interest near a major resistance at USD 800 (previous support). On the downside, the USD 740 and 720 levels are decent supports. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash fell below the USD 1,110 support and traded towards USD 1,030. However, BCH/USD also recovered recently like bitcoin, and it is currently down 5.1% to USD 1,090. It must settle back above USD 1,110 to start a fresh upside wave.
Ripple remained in a bearish zone and it settled below USD 0.90. XRP/USD could resume it downside in the short term towards the USD 0.80 and 0.75 levels. Other Altcoins Market Today

The debate for its utilization as an alternative currency and medium of exchange has been going on for years. Bitcoin price was hammered from the $20,000 mark at the beginning of the year to only $6,000. This was after intellectuals, regulators and global leaders stressed on the need for regulating cryptocurrencies during the World Economic Forum.  Regulators and senior market analysts have turned significantly bearish on digital currencies. They don’t appreciate investments in bitcoin and other digital currencies – indeed they are predicting an instant crash and massive risk of losing the investment. Bitcoin’s trading volume has decreased substantially in the last few weeks following bearish comments from key players. The reports show that bitcoin transactions dropped to the lowest level in two years, while Google trends-data indicated a drop of 80% in searches for bitcoin. The U.K Prime Minister Theresa May had promised to carefully look at bitcoin and other digital currencies to avoid the illegal movement of wealth. The regulators from U.K. aren’t sending positive signals, suggesting strict regulatory actions from the one of the significant cryptocurrency market. While Bangladesh, India, China and several other countries have already banned cryptocurrency trading, amid the threat of money laundering and tax evasion – poor response from European and British regulators poses a risk for the possible crash in prices. Bitcoin investors should now take steps to protect their investment from risks that could result in complete losses, the Bank of England’s Chief Economist has warned. >>Apple Co-Founder Falls Victim To Bitcoin Scam Followed by harsh remarks from the Bank of England’s governor, the Chief Economist Andy Haldane warned for the immediate price crash.

The downward trend was due to lower volume – which is a frustrating sign for bulls. Bitcoin prices lost close to $1,000 from its Monday high, the price of bitcoin token was around $10,594 today. It seems that bulls are losing their grip on the crypto markets after the ruthless response from major regulators of European countries and the United Kingdom. The entire crypto market has been under pressure over the last three days – Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and the rest of top ten digital currencies are declining at a mid-single-digit rate. Ethereum moves back below the $800 mark for the first time in the last fifteen days, while Ripple trades at around $0.90. Trading volume always has substantial importance in settling the price whether its stock market or crypto market. Lower trading volume signifies declining trader’s confidence – which could have the negative impact on the price performance.   Bitcoin has been experiencing a significant drop in trading volume and confirmed transactions over the last couple of weeks. The total confirmed transactions declined to the two year low of 180,000 on Feb 26.     Bitcoin Google search trends are falling at a tremendous rate suggesting a declining interest for cryptocurrencies. Google trend data indicated a drop of 80% in searches for bitcoin to the lowest level in last five months. While the global markets and financial world has widely accepted blockchain technologies, they aren’t accepting the cryptocurrency phenomena as an alternative currency – and they have several factual reasons for their denouncement. Regulators and business magnates are continually hammering trader’s sentiments by sending warning signals; the majority of them criticizing digital currencies due to its volatile nature, underlying value and its use for illegal purposes. The former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Rogoff believes bitcoin isn’t worth more than $100 in his view, saying: “I think Bitcoin will be worth a tiny fraction of what it is now if we’re headed out 10 years from now… I would see $100 as being a lot more likely than $100,000.” Featured Image: Depositphotos/© gustavofrazao",-838.3299999999999,0

However, mining is expensive and as more people set up rigs and more coins are mined, it only gets harder and pricier. Exactly how pricy, EliteFixtures.com found out by doing a worldwide study. The subsidiary of Crescent Electric Supply Company, an American distributor of electrical hardware, looked at the cost to mine one Bitcoin in 115 different countries based on average electricity rates according to government data, utility company data, and/or reports. On another interesting note, it depends on the rig exactly how quickly a single coin can be mined. According to their calculations, this ranges from 548.56 days to 2194.22 days. The most expensive country by far is South Korea. For mining a single coin, you would need to cash out USD 26,170 - hardly a good trade-off. Niue, an island country in the South Pacific Ocean, comes in second, with a significantly cheaper rate of “only” USD 17,566. In third place is Bahrain, where you would need USD 16,773, fourth place belongs to the Solomon Islands standing at USD 16,209, and number five are the Cook Islands with USD 15,861 - still not worth its value on the current market. After these staggering numbers, the cheapest countries look like a delight to live in: the cheapest by far is Venezuela, with only USD 531 needed for that one coin. But, as EliteFixtures.com explains, “Their electricity rates are heavily subsidized by the government, leading to incredibly low prices.” Second cheapest are Trinidad and Tobago at USD 1,190, followed by Uzbekistan and its USD 1,788. Europe’s only truly cheap country is Ukraine, where mining a single coin costs USD 1,852, and then it’s back to Asia with Myanmar, where it costs USD 1,983 to quench your FOMO (fear of missing out). Whether you decide to mine or trade may depend on your country of residence. If you’re from South Korea, you would need a miracle on the market to ever break even.

Yesterday, we discussed how bitcoin price was consolidating above a key support at USD 11,000. Later, BTC/USD faced an increased selling pressure and the pair broke the mentioned support.
As a result, the pair is down 6.3% to USD 10,550. It even broke the USD 10,600 support, which is a bearish sign. The next major support on the downside is at USD 10,200, followed by USD 10,000.
On the upside, the broken support at USD 11,000 may perhaps act as a strong resistance if the price corrects higher during the coming sessions. Ethereum
Ethereum also followed bitcoin and tumbled by around 6.9% to USD 787. It broke a major support area at USD 800, which ignited further losses.
An immediate support on the downside is at USD 780. Below the mentioned USD 780, the next target for sellers could be USD 750. On the upside, the USD 800 and 820 levels have turned into resistances. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash tumbled 7.10% to USD 1,150. It seems like bitcoin dragged a few major altcoins along with it, and it may extend further. The next major support on the downside is at USD 1,100.
Ripple also declined by around 7% and moved back below USD 0.9500. XRP/USD could extend losses toward the USD 0.85 and 0.80. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today’s best performer so far is Iconomi, a digital asset management platform. ICN price moved up by more than 25% to USD 2.15. The main reason was the announcement to support fourteen new countries for Tier 2 Verification - Angola, Australia, Bolivia, Dominican Republic, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Namibia, Pakistan, Philippines, Senegal, Taiwan and Thailand.  Overall, the current market sentiment is slightly negative and if bitcoin price fails to recover from USD 10,500, there can be more downsides in the near term.",-838.3299999999999,0

Now, six months after the activation, SegWit adoption is on the rise and the benefits of this network upgrade are finally being felt by active bitcoin users.  Currently, over a quarter of bitcoin transactions are SegWit transactions. This is more than twice as many as in October 2017 and the number is on the rise according to data compiled by SegWit.Party. This is translating into much lower transaction fees and a substantial increase in transaction speeds than we witnessed in the second half of 2017.  The increase in adoption is thanks to the growing number of bitcoin service providers who are implemented the network upgrade.  Moreover, version 0.16.0 of Bitcoin Core, the standard software client of the bitcoin network, was released on February 26 to provide full support for SegWit in the wallet and user interfaces, which has helped to boost SegWit adoption.  As a result of the increasing SegWit adoption, the number of unconfirmed transactions has dropped dramatically for first time in four months. Furthermore, average bitcoin transaction fees dropped from a high of over USD 50 in December to a current price of around USD 3.  It has to be said though, that the number of confirmed transaction did not solely drop due to the increase in SegWit adoption but also because outstanding bitcoin buy orders were clogging the network at the end of 2017 when bitcoin was close to its USD 20,000 all-time high and because of bitcoin’s price drop, fewer people are buying bitcoin now than in late 2017.  Nonetheless, in light of the slow transactions times and high fees we witnessed in November and December of last year, this is a welcome sight to the active bitcoin community who actually use bitcoin as a spending currency and to send money abroad.  Furthermore, the rise in SegWit adoption is giving a clear signal that the bitcoin community wants to see bitcoin succeed, not only as a digital-gold like investment asset but as the world’s leading alternative currency.  *** Background Segregated Witness, more commonly referred to as SegWit, is an upgrade to the Bitcoin network that has been activated in August 2017 to provide a solution to bitcoin’s scalability challenges and to eliminate the issue of transaction malleability. 
SegWit aids bitcoin’s scalability by increasing the effective block size without increasing the block size limit. Instead, SegWit removes signature data in each block to increase the number of bitcoin transactions that can be put into each block. This leads to the Bitcoin blockchain being able to process more transactions per second that before. 
Prior to February, dozens of bitcoin wallets and exchanges - including Electrum, Ledger, LocalBitcoins, and Wirex - have already implemented SegWit much to the appreciation of their customers. 
Bitcoin wallet and exchange Luno’s SegWit announced SegWit support on February 14 and popular digital currency exchange Bitfinex made its announcement on February 20. 
On February 23, Coinbase announced that it is implementing SegWit on both its Coinbase wallet and its GDAX exchange.

What wasn’t foreseen, however, was Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak coming forward and saying he was a victim of a bitcoin scam.  It’s been known for quite some that bitcoin, as well as every other virtual currency, holds a lot of risks. But when the co-founder of one of the largest technology companies in the world falls into its trap, then we know that anyone is susceptible to being duped by cryptocurrency scams.  According to Wozniak, he had seven bitcoins stolen from him through fraud. Essentially what happened is this: an individual purchased the bitcoins from the 67-year old American entrepreneur and inventor through a credit card, and then proceeded to terminate the credit card payment. The scariest part of it all, according to Steve Wozniak, was just how easy it was to steal the bitcoins.  Sure, at first glance, seven bitcoins might not seem like a lot. However, it’s actually the opposite. At the time, Wozniak purchased the bitcoins back when it was valued at $700, but today, his loss is valued at roughly $71,400. Personally, this would have scared me off right away, but that wasn’t the case for the Apple co-founder.  >>India’s NASSCOM Partners With Blockchain Institute Wozniak kept his bitcoin holdings until the end of 2017. When he did finally announce in January that he sold his bitcoin holdings, he didn’t cite the bitcoin scam. In fact, he said it was only because he had only moved into cryptocurrency solely for experimental purposes. He then added that he never wanted to become one of those individuals that constantly watch it and fret over the price. That is extremely justifiable. It seems every week I’m biting my nails to see the direction the cryptocurrency is heading in. One week it’s dropping below the $12,000 mark and the next its well above it.  Now that we know about Steve Wozniak’s experience with the digital currency, I think it will be interesting to see if people follow in his lead and sell their bitcoin holdings in fear of falling victim to a bitcoin scam.

Known by his stage name 50 Cent and affectionately called Fiddy, the rapper filed documents in his bankruptcy case admitting that “recent media reports have falsely stated” that he failed to disclose alleged interests in Bitcoin to his Bankruptcy Court, but in reality he has “never owned, and does not own, a Bitcoin account or any Bitcoins, and to the best of his knowledge, none of his companies had a Bitcoin account from 2014 to the present.” Last month, TMZ reported that the rapper “discovered” he had made millions thanks to letting people buy his 2014 album Animal Ambition using Bitcoin. Not only did he not correct the reports, he also encouraged them through a now-deleted photo on his Instagram account where he said he was feeling “proud of himself” in the caption. As to why, in the court documents obtained by The Blast, Fiddy explains: “As a general matter, so long as a press story is not irreparably damaging to my image or brand, I usually do not feel the need to publicly deny the reporting. This is particular true when I feel the press report in question is favorable to my image or brand, even if the report is based on a misunderstanding of the facts or contains outright falsehoods.” This is not the first time he claimed to have more money than he does:  in 2016, he told a judge that the cash in one of his Instagram photos was ""prop money.""",331.7000000000007,1

It fell on USD 0.79 on Sunday, having peaked at USD 34 on December 23. Once, Bitcoin’s very low transaction fees were one of its selling points - until they soared in December 2017, showing that the prices are not the only volatile thing about Bitcoin. The climb of fees in late 2017 had many shying away from Bitcoin as a payment system; for example, Valve, an American video game developer and digital distribution company, stopped accepting Bitcoin on Steam. Bitpay, a bitcoin payment service provider, set a minimum transaction size to USD 100 - before promptly lowering it to USD 5 due to customer uproar - and Stripe, a payment processor, stopped accepting Bitcoin payments for customers in January due to the fact that thanks to high fees, there were “fewer and fewer use cases” for it. Some other companies switched to other cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin Cash, which was mostly created in the first place to keep fees lower. So the simplest answer to decreasing fees would be the decreasing number of transactions. A handy chart from Bitinfocharts.com shows the average fees: While another from Blockchain.info shows the number of transactions:  When compared, it seems that the fees and the prices shot up simultaneously, but also fell together. This is easily explained by people being willing to pay top dollar to get their Bitcoins into exchanges to sell them at the high prices of December. As the prices fell, so did people’s interest, and transaction fees simply followed suit. The decrease in transactions, however, is another matter entirely. There is a realistic possibility that exorbitant fee prices have forced large transaction processors to implement a technology called “batching”. It means including many payments to many different recipients into a single Bitcoin transaction - thus leaving more space on the blockchain. That is exactly what crypto exchange ShapeShift did, according to their announcement.  Mike Belshe, BitGo, a Blockchain security company, engineer, said to Coindesk that, “even if just one large exchange started batching transactions, it could have a huge impact on the overall transaction load.” Another solution to this problem that has already occurred to some was to simply raise the block size in Bitcoin - which produced Bitcoin Cash after the group did not get their way. Since the forking, what remained behind was the “small block” faction, which will fight tooth and claw to find a way around the problem without raising the block size. So they’ve focused on a technological upgrade called Segregated Witness (known as SegWit in the industry) that separates cryptographic signatures from the rest of the blockchain data, thus effectively increasing block size. Rolling out the necessary changes for SegWit takes time, though -  six months after the upgrade went into effect, only about 14% of Bitcoin transactions use the new format. There hasn't been much of a recent increase in SegWit use either. For the past several months, only about 10-14% of transactions, according to SegWit tracking site SegWit Party. Resurgence of Bitcoin fees is a real possibility. If the current trend continues, a new rise in the price might bring higher fees as well - so low prices right now may be a blessing in disguise. But for now, lower fees might set a new standard, thus restricting them from rising to previous heights.",364.03000000000065,1

There’s no in-between. There’s no Switzerland. It’s an all or nothing sort of deal.  Earlier today, the U.K. Treasury Committee launched an inquiry into cryptocurrency and blockchain, stating that it will be looking into the risks and dangers open to consumers who use cryptocurrencies. Also announced today is that one of India’s most prominent tech industry organizations has partnered with the BRI, Blockchain Resource Institute. Why? To create a blockchain institute which will develop skill sets for blockchain adoption and usage in India. Pretty different compared to the U.K’s announcement, right? One country dislikes cryptocurrency and blockchain, the other loves it. Enough, at least, to partner with the BRI in order to help create a digital economy in India.  We also know that Canada is team cryptocurrency and blockchain. I mean, KFC now accepts Bitcoin as payment. That wasn’t enough, however, as India’s National Association of Software Services Companies (NASSCOM) disclosed today that BRI researchers will be backed by the government of Canada. The Canadian government, whose Prime Minister is Justin Trudeau, will be helping BRI developers to learn more about blockchain technology. The hope is that it will teach the researchers how to create various blockchain-based tools in India.  Blockchain has become extremely popular as of late. There are dozens of companies starting to integrate the technology into their corporate world. The chairman of NASSCOM stated that he believes blockchain will be beneficial to the nation but knows that it will be a long-term effort. In fact, the research is being split into two separate parts. The second phase will be the construction of a blockchain institute in India.  It will be interesting to see if all goes planned. If it does, I think it would be quite revolutionary.  Even CNN stated that a blockchain institute in India would “provide high-end technology capabilities.” What do you think?

The crypto market has experienced some major losses in the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, all coins but two within the top 100, are down right now. To get a taste of the bloodshed, take a look at the data from CoinMarketCap: The top ten cryptocurrencies are all experiencing major losses. Leading the pack in losses is Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC). There’s no denying that the markets are struggling – but why? Bitcoin may be the reason. >> Check out the Crypto Olympics: Bitcoin vs. VeChain Bitcoin transaction fees are at their lowest level since October 2017. According to BitInfoCharts, which was last updated on February 20th, Bitcoin transactions fees are going for US$3.042. Bitcoin transactions fees have been declining ever since hitting their all-time high back in December 2017 (US$55.16). However, even as recently as a couple of weeks ago, Bitcoin transactions fees were in the $10 range. That’s not terribly expensive, but $3.00 is even better. I would imagine that there are a lot of people taking advantage of the relatively cheap Bitcoin transaction fees. This may explain why many of the altcoins are declining today – people are selling their altcoin assets so they can gobble up Bitcoin while it’s cheap to process. In addition to the cheap Bitcoin transaction fees, Coinbase and Bitfinex will be updating the exchanges with a software called SegWit. SegWit (Segregated Witness), is touted as a way to speed up Bitcoin transactions while also lowering fees by a further 20%. It does so by increasing the block size (so more transactions will be able to fit per block). This will drastically improve Bitcoin’s efficiency as a cryptocurrency if SegWit does what it is meant to do. Bitfinex accounts for almost 38% of all US dollar-Bitcoin trades. Coinbase accounts for about 17%. Coinbase’s rollout of SegWit won’t fully come into effect until the middle of next week; however, Bitfinex’s support of SegWit was announced yesterday. The adoption of SegWit by these two major exchanges will no doubt have strong long-term effects for Bitcoin. For right now, this could also be accounting for the altcoin selloff currently happening. People are getting ready to take advantage of the lower Bitcoin transaction fees and processing times by selling their other cryptos now. Neither of these points changes the fact that Bitcoin is also currently down. As for why Bitcoin is down right now, I’m not sure. But if Bitcoin is down, it’s little surprise that many of the other coins are also down. When Bitcoin drops, people tend to panic, selling not only their Bitcoin but also their other crypto assets. >> Bitcoin Price Watch Featured image: artispixel",-681.8000000000011,0

Bitcoin, Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH) and the remaining top 20 currencies all posted significant losses today, and only Monero seems untouched by the crash. Bitcoin price was close to hitting the $12,000 mark yesterday; but BTC price took a big U-turn today, dipping more than 8% to the level of $10,700.  The crackdown on bitcoin traders in Bangladesh and pessimistic comments from the Bank of England weighed on cryptocurrency prices. The renewed regulatory concerns along with trader’s strategy to capitalize on the recent rally impacted virtual currency prices. The Dhaka Tribune reported a more forceful crackdown on cryptocurrency traders, and the report suggested that local police are “on the hunt for bitcoin users.” The Bangladeshi government warned their citizens to avoid using bitcoin for any financial transactions. Bangladesh Bank said, “Bitcoin is neither accepted nor considered legal tender anywhere in the world.” Bangladesh is among the third world countries and has been seeing high levels of corruption and money laundering. The country had previously barred their citizens from transferring money to abroad via illegal sources such as Hundi.  The emergence of digital currencies and their anonymity feature opened the doors for money launders to make the big movement of money. Bank of England (BoE) Chief Mark Carney added to bearish sentiments. He said, “Bitcoin has pretty much failed as a currency by standard benchmarks and is neither a store of value nor a useful way to buy items.” Mark Carney comments look strong because of the significant price volatility. For instance, if you want to purchase goods through bitcoin, then how would you settle the price for those goods given the significant bitcoin price swings?  Ethereum and Ripple, the second and the third largest digital currency, plunged more than 9% in Wednesday trading. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) were among the most prominent laggards; both fell more than 13% today. The selloff has wiped off $50 billion from total market capitalization of cryptocurrency markets. Analysts have a mixed opinion on the future of cryptocurrencies. Some analysts are predicting a sharp growth, while others are forecasting a lousy ending.

According to Bloomberg, the Treasury guidelines prohibit authorities from storing the stash - currently worth around USD 22.8 million - on virtual exchanges or services. Instead, they are to be kept off the internet, in a cold storage. Finnish authorities have declined to comment on how the confiscated coins have been kept up to now.  According to the customs office in Helsinki, most of the coins have been confiscated in dozens of raids conducted since 2016. In this case, the Finnish government prohibits authorities from considering any crypto asset as currency; rather, it is defined as “an asset that, as a rule, can’t be used or accepted as a means of payment or as an investment,” according to the Treasury document. After a binding court ruling on the confiscation of these Bitcoins, the Finnish state will convert the assets into euros at public auctions, since commercial exchanges can be “untrustworthy and opaque,” says the Treasury. Confiscated cryptocurrency being auctioned off by the state is not without precedent. In December 2017, during an undercover bust of an underground crime network, Bulgaria has seized enough Bitcoin to pay off a fifth of its national debt - a stunning 213,519 Bitcoins, at the time valued at USD 3.5 billion.

After the massive selloff in late January and early February, bitcoin price rose 80% in the last two weeks alone. Bitcoin price has breached the $11000 mark during the weekend; the coin is trading at just over $11,000 this morning  – and now has the market capitalization of $185 billion. The broader rally in cryptocurrency prices has pushed the total market capitalization above $500 billion for the first time in the last three weeks.  Regulatory concerns along with the price manipulation and bearish remarks from notables were the key drivers for the violent selloff in bitcoin prices. However, softer than expected regulatory actions from South Korea and the United Stated led bulls to control the market over the last two weeks. South Korean authorities have been steadily moving back from their earlier strict stance. They have implemented less severe regulatory actions than what investors had initially thought. The U.S. CFTC chairman said, “regulators should have a thoughtful and balanced response and not a dismissive one.” Moreover, predictions of sustainable growth in bitcoin prices from key analysts have been adding to bullish sentiments. Saxo Bank analyst, Kay Van-Petersen, who appropriately predicted the substantial rally in cryptocurrency price at the start of last year – now forecasts that bitcoin is set to hit the $100,000 mark. Cryptocurrencies are in early stages, and it’s quite difficult to predict whether they will turn out to be a huge bubble, or if they can replace the traditional financial world. The Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin warned investors for the possible slump. He suggested investors invest the money only if they can afford to lose. He said: cryptocurrencies are still a new and hyper-volatile asset class, and could drop to near-zero at any time. Don’t put in more money than you can afford to lose.

In a liquidity crisis, central banks simply print more money to make up for a decline in lending and spending in the private sector. Since there is no institution which sets the rate for Bitcoin creation, such a solution would be impossible. JPMorgan states in their note: “The ability to provide adequate liquidity is a hallmark of a well-functioning market, but more so during times of crisis. One benefit of fiat money is that it can be used to provide emergency liquidity from the outside. This is the role central banks play as the lender-of-last resort.” In the other corner of the ring, Bitcoin fans argue that JPMorgan assumes that this way of patching up the economy is actually good.  Aaron Lasher, the chief marketing officer at Breadwallet, a bitcoin wallet company, asks why there is any need for emergency liquidity in the first place. In his opinion, it all comes down to the fact that fiat currencies are centralized and thus printable at the whim of a certain group of people - central bankers. These bankers face no risks for themselves - they can always print more money to back themselves up, with the consequence of inflation. Arthur Hayes, the chief executive at BitMEX, a P2P bitcoin trading platform, points out that money printing is hardly the best solution for economies at the brink of collapse - as Zimbabwe and Venezuela can testify. He adds, “Money printing delays the inevitable. Without the ability to print base money at all, any institutional that extended credit would be evaluated by the market on its ability to responsibly originate loans.” Although printing money as a last reserve is a viable solution in a controlled environment, like the US did after the recent financial crisis, Zimbabwe and Venezuela are examples of how it can go wrong for everyone else.",98.19999999999891,1

Steem is a cryptocurrency used to power the Steemit platform; a blockchain-based social media platform aimed at incentivizing users to create and curate content on Steemit. Each creator gets rewarded for their work. Currently, there is a 40% discount if you buy the game on its release date, costing only $1.19. The game itself is a first-person viewed game, similar to that of Call of Duty. It features 24 puzzles that you have to solve while making your way through a haunted mansion. What’s cool is it allows you to play as a team or you can play just individually. Each member will be able to leave clues or lead someone off track throughout the maze for others to find.  Source: MonteCrypto This sounds like an extremely cool game and well thought out. From what I can see, it doesn’t break any of Steam’s rules on games. The game developers have given out an initial clue on the game’s FAQ page. The first clue links to a bit of code on GitHub designed specifically to help game players crack their Bitcoin wallet password if they only remember some of it. As the game gets closer to launch, the team behind MonteCrypto will release more clues, so check the page’s source code frequently! Look for the game video at the bottom of this post! >> Tron Dogs Update There are other ways to win Bitcoin if you didn’t already know. It took someone THREE years to crack a puzzle within a painting that landed them 4.87 Bitcoins. Obviously worth a LOT more than when the painting originated.

His father Michael has been looking for a way to access his late son’s crypto wallet, hosted by blockchain.info, for the past three years without much success, Bloomberg reports. Michael Moody has no way to access these funds without the private keys, or a special code needed to access the funds, and there is no way to find out even how much is in that wallet. Moody added that young people “need to be better educated about the steps needed to be taken to ensure their investments are properly secured, both for themselves and for future heirs.” On the topic of how to pass down your cryptocurrency after death, Peter Henning, a professor at Wayne State University Law School and veteran SEC and Justice Department lawyer, said, “My bet is that ICOs [Initial Coin Offering], when issued by a company, they’re going to be considered securities. If they are securities, then just like stock or bonds you can put them in your will and pass them down.” But this may be some time in coming. In the meantime, the crypto exchange CoinBase offers an alternative solution: the company asks for documents such as a death certificate and will in order to transfer the assets. But the idea of somebody else being in custody of your crypto is not in line with its idea of decentralization. The problem of death through accident, like in Moody’s case, still remains. It is highly unlikely that someone in their 20s or 30s would have a will ready in case something happened to them - and even then, adding your crypto wallet keys to the will may slip your mind. This way, the keys are lost - perhaps forever.",894.7099999999991,1

Over the course of the past couple of months, we have seen a number of countries roll out new uses for virtual currencies. In Canada, for instance, individuals can now use Bitcoin to purchase meals from KFC. In Australia, travelers will soon be able to purchase items using Bitcoin in the Brisbane Airport. Now, we’ve been informed that luxury flats in Dubai can be purchased with the virtual currency. In fact, there have already been 50 flats sold in Dubai for Bitcoin. Business Insider published a report yesterday which stated that two UK entrepreneurs have sold 50 luxury flats in Dubai for Bitcoin. This is significant news as it suggests the cryptocurrency industry, at least in Dubai, might be making a move into real estate. The world was informed in September of last year that the two entrepreneurs, Michelle Mone and Douglas Barrowman, had launched a $325 million luxury development in Dubai. It is forecasted to be finished in two years. After announcing the launch of the ‘Aston Plaza and Residences’, Mone and Barrowman promised that they will be offering 150 apartments that can be purchased using bitcoin. For perspective, the entrepreneurs will be offering 150 apartments out of the 1,3000 for bitcoin. Offering luxury apartments in Dubai for bitcoin is definitely a first, but it appears investors are on board with it. According to the February Business Insider report, 50 out of the 150 apartments offered have been sold. In fact, Mone told the publication that there were a couple buyers who purchased two apartments. To top it off, Mone, who is the founder of lingerie brand Ultimo, stated that there was one buyer who bought as many as ten luxury Dubai apartments. This news comes at a time when more and more people are fighting to see more cryptocurrency regulation. In fact, the United States, Germany, and France have all called for crypto regulation to be discussed at next month’s G20 summit in Argentina. Therefore, it will be interesting to see how the outcome of the summit affects the potential sale of more Dubai apartments for bitcoin. Read More About Cryptocurrency Regulation >> What do you think?

Markets had witnessed Bitcoin’s upside volatility last year but found it equally volatile on the downside; the slump from $19,000 to less than $6,000 in last month alone vindicated the instability for both trends.   In spite of the massive sideways movement, returns from crypto funds topped hedge fund returns last year. For instance, Pantera Capital, which started its first cryptocurrency fund in 2013, generated returns of 22,000 percent since its inception. Last year, Cryptocurrency fund returns were significantly higher from the average gains of 7% from hedge funds. Dan Morehead, the CEO of Pantera Capital, who bought his first bitcoin for around $72, is now predicting a substantial rally in price. He said, “Bitcoin should return to peak levels in the next couple of weeks and will continue growing from there.” In December, Dan predicted bitcoin price to fall by half before rising back up. The first part of his prediction turned out to be true and now traders are carefully thinking about the second part of his prophecy.  Bitcoin and other digital currencies are showing strong support trading around their current level. The entire cryptocurrency market has been flat over the last three days; seems it is looking for solid reports to make a new trend. Some analysts are now correlating the movement of crypto markets with stock markets, expecting prices to trade in similar trends.  This assumption could be partially correct as the overall market sentiments offer support to the whole investment markets. Last year, the rally in tech, financial and industrial stocks combined with Trump’s business pro initiatives, led the major U.S. indices to hit new records. Though Bitcoin and digital currencies have beaten stock market returns last year, the market dynamics seems quite tough this year. Experts are predicting the crash, while regulators are making strict rules to reduce illegal activities associated with the currencies. Global financial institutions are calling them a risk to global financial stability. However, traders aren’t ignoring the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies; allowing bulls to strengthen their stance of getting support from regulatory actions. They believe regulating cryptocurrencies could turn out to be a positive catalyst for long-term sustainability. Featured Image: twitter",465.1399999999994,1

Ethereum, Bitcoin cash and other major altcoins followed the bullish trend and moved higher. However, the third largest cryptocurrency, Ripple failed to capitalize and traded lower by roughly 3%. Today’s best performer so far is bitcoin cash since it is up by around 21% and is currently trading above USD 1,200. During the upside move, BCH/USD broke an important resistance at USD 1,000 to set the pace for more gains. The past two sessions were bullish on bitcoin as the cryptocurrency started a fresh upside move after correcting lower towards the USD 7,500 support. During the recent upside move, the price broke the USD 8,000 and 8,200 resistance levels to set the pace for more gains. Technically, bitcoin was up more than 4% and is currently trading above USD 8,500. If it continues to move higher, it could easily move past USD 8,800. Above USD 8,900, the price will most likely break the USD 9,000 resistance. On the downside, support sits at USD 8,000. A break below the stated USD 8,000 support may call for a new downside wave towards the USD 7,600 and USD 7,400 levels. Ethereum posted minor gains and traded higher by 1.6% to USD 843. It seems like ETH/USD is finding hard to pierce the USD 850 and 865 resistance levels. A push above the mentioned levels may perhaps call for a test of USD 1,000. Ripple price was down today by roughly 3% to USD 0.7600. XRP/USD has to move above USD 0.8000 to continue higher, otherwise, there is a risk of a downside reaction in the near term.

This, coupled with regulatory fears and ICO scams, has led to increasingly bearish sentiments towards the cryptocurrency market in general. It has lost $340 billion USD since the start of the year. So it’s great news for investors today, as the price of Bitcoin unexpectedly soared 11.4% – over $800 USD – from last night’s low, at 3:30 pm EST this afternoon (the time of writing). But the even bigger news is that analysts are predicting Bitcoin to hit $50K this year. In an interview with CNBC, Thomas Glucksmann, head of APAC business development at Gatecoin, said that “There is no reason why we couldn’t see bitcoin pushing $50,000 by December.” This, he says, is due to a market rebound as well as “major technology developments” such as bitcoin’s upcoming Lightning Network, which aims to speed up transactions. >> Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC): Coins to Invest in Before the Market Recovers In the same report, Jamie Burke, CEO of Outlier Ventures, stated that he believes the market will likely go on a bull run. It will be “comparative if not greater than last year potentially reaching the trillion-dollar mark before a proper crypto winter sets in,” he said. This ‘crypto winter‘ refers to a period where the market will settle down and focus on market fundamentals, potentially becoming more stable. And to top it all off, Ran Neuner, host of CNBC’s Cryptotrader show, pinned this tweet to his account in a moment of bravery: For the record, I am pinning this tweet. Bitcoin will finish 2018 at $50 000. — Ran Neuner (@cryptomanran) February 2, 2018 With such optimism abound in the industry, it may really be true that we’ll see Bitcoin grow tens of thousands of dollars in coming months. But it’s important to bear in mind that such predictions have been made before… >> Cryptocurrencies – Excitement is Limited In 2014, a Coindesk poll showed that most readers thought that one Bitcoin would reach $10,000 by the end of that year, while venture capital firm LightSpeed India gave it a more modest $4000 – $5000. It ended the year at about $315. This goes both ways, of course. In 2015, a Financial Times article gave a bleak outlook for the cryptocurrency, playing on the fact that it had been floating at around $350 for months and that the chances of it becoming a mainstream currency ‘are now zero’. The mainstream currency statement is still debatable, but the article certainly hasn’t aged well since bitcoin hit nearly $20,000 per coin about three years later. Anyway, none of this is to say that bitcoin won’t do well this year, but it is a casual reminder to be wary of predictions which seem authoritative. Either way, it looks as though it’s safe to be bullish at the moment and hope that today’s great performance continues in coming weeks. Featured image: BTCmanager.com",-134.1899999999996,0

Coincidentally, the Dow Jones plunged a total of 1,100 points yesterday, around 4.6%, which is the lowest since the European debt crisis back in 2011. The stock market corrected itself from yesterday’s downfall, is there a correlation between the two? I really don’t think so. The cryptocurrency market crash plummeted yesterday, due to the Chinese government implementing a regulation completely banning its citizens from viewing cryptocurrency websites, via a government-ran firewall. Many analysts are stating that yesterday’s drop was due to rising inflation and the usual market correction. This shows that there is absolutely no correlation between the drop of the two markets. Back in 2008, the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), and its blockchain were born. It was due to the housing financial crisis, where the banks (due to greed) crashed the entire stock market. Satoshi Nakamoto, the Alias, and originator of Bitcoin envisioned a decentralized digital currency that isn’t controlled by a singular entity – this was Bitcoin’s original promise. >> Bitcoin Price Analysis Bitcoin as an Investment Asset? However, the issue most individuals are having with Bitcoin is that it is failing to live up to its original promise. Bitcoin and its blockchain were intended, by its unknown creator, to be a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Its current scalability issues have resulted in slow transaction times and high fees. BTC remains the top cryptocurrency with the highest total market cap and highest price, however, it could be passed in market cap this year. Just a year ago the digital currency held 85% of the total cryptocurrency market cap dominance but now, is currently only 35%. The digital token just this year has transitioned from a digital currency used for peer to peer transactions, to an investable asset, like gold and silver. Many new altcoins on the market are being used as a payment and transaction system instead because their transaction confirmation time is 10 times faster than that of Bitcoins. >> Stellar & Ripple Comparison Bitcoin doesn’t even come close to Litecoin (LTC), DASH (DASH), Ripple (XRP), and Stellar (XLM) when it comes to transaction time confirmation. Some Bitcoin holders now use the cryptocurrency to purchase large ticket items, such as houses and cars but day-to-day payments with BTC do not occur. If Bitcoin developers can agree upon and fix its scalability issue, it could potentially switch back to its original goal. However, with faster blockchain projects/coins popping up every day, I believe that it is highly unlikely. Featured Image: Gizmodo",702.25,1

The decision comes after a brief period of research in which the Italian company was in talks to supply Swiss mining firm Envion AG with power from renewable sources. According to a Bloomberg report, the discussions with Envion were part of a broader effort by Enel to look at the market for selling power to cryptocurrency miners. >> Mining for Charity: UNICEF’s Ethereum Donation Drive Enel is one of Europe’s top renewable energy suppliers and is also the primary energy supplier in Italy. It explained its decision in a report by Reuters, stating that they have made clear steps toward sustainable energy and therefore “sees the intensive use of energy dedicated to cryptocurrency mining as an unsustainable practice that does not fit with the business model it is pursuing.” The move is sure to disappoint Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiasts in the country, who likely are waiting for some good news amid harsh government crackdowns on cryptocurrencies elsewhere. On the bright side, despite Enel’s aversion to digital coins, they are still keen to explore the applications of blockchain technology in the energy industry. This was the primary focus of the EnelFocusOn event that was hosted in Santiago, Chile, on February 2nd. The event saw Joel Comm, a ‘blockchain evangelist’, highlight solutions offered by blockchain in “making the energy industry more sustainable”, say Enel. >> More Crypto Bans: Lloyds Shuts Down Credit Card Purchases Bitcoin mining is becoming a hot topic as governments, energy companies and environmentalists grow increasingly concerned with the huge amounts of electricity needed to operate mining farms. Many Chinese mining companies are looking to the west for potential mining spots as the Chinese government, overburdened by energy demand, begins a crackdown on the activity. Renewable energy is of particular interest given its abundance, sustainability and relative cheapness in places such as Canada, yet the demand is pushing suppliers to breaking point. Meanwhile, the Italian government has proposed cryptocurrency regulations which will ‘clarify’ the use of Bitcoin and others in the country. According to Coindesk, the regulations will help enforce new anti-money laundering rules put forward by the European Union.

The huge volatility in crypto markets wiped off more than $417 billion from the total market capitalization in the last month alone making this bitcoin price plunge one of the greatest yet. Consequently, the broader selloff has pulled back the cryptocurrency prices at the lowest level in the last three months. Bitcoin price plunged below $8,000 during the Friday trade, and although bounced back above $9,000 over the weekend, it has again dipped below $8,000 today. After those dramatic swings, it is currently trading in the range of $7,400.   China, which has recently expressed strong concerns over the cryptocurrency trading, is now planning to impose a complete ban on domestic and international cryptocurrency trading platforms. Based on the local media reports, the Central Bank of China is likely to block all platforms related to the issuance of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency trading. Already, China has banned cryptocurrency trading in domestic markets. But now, the country has extended the concentrated efforts to foreign platforms too. >>What Is France’s Stance On Bitcoin Regulations?

Cryptocurrency mania seems to be ending over the last month. After South Korea, several major institutions have stressed for the strict regulatory actions against the cryptocurrencies. The largest U.S. banks such as Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase, have stopped their customers from buying cryptocurrencies using credit cards.

According to a filing with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the global shipping giant is considering setting up a system of locker banks so that it could take in Bitcoin as payment.   >>Bitcoin Price Analysis – Can BTC/USD Rebound? Here’s how it works: As outlined in the USPTO filing document, a seller can leave an item inside a locker (which can be rented) for the buyer to pick up later-on by entering the designated payment, thus completing the transaction. The aim is to create a point-of-sale (POS) system that accepts the following payment methods: However, only time will tell whether this kind of locker bank system will appeal to the general public and whether people are willing to use Bitcoins to pay for UPS packages. This is not the first time that UPS expressed its intention to dabble in the blockchain industry. In November, the company joined a blockchain consortium called the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance, focused on the trucking and shipping industry. On joining the consortium, Linda Weakland, UPS director of enterprise architecture and innovation, stated: “The technology has the potential to increase transparency and efficiency among shippers, carriers, brokers, consumers, vendors and other supply chain stakeholders.” >>The Best Cryptocurrency Memes in 2018 (So Far) With today’s announcement, we are starting to see a trend where shipping companies — which make up a vital part of the global economy — are leaning towards using Bitcoin as a mainstream method of payment.

According to estimates, Google search for bitcoin soared sharply in December. The worldwide searches for bitcoin tripled in December compared with the previous month. The strategy looks to be effective, considering the correlation between price movement, trading volume, and google searches. Colas, the first analyst to follow bitcoin said, “Google search patterns can forecast bitcoin’s future. He said he uses Google Trends to track how many people enter “bitcoin” into the search engine.” The growth in bitcoin popularity also supported the growth in numbers of wallets. However, Google search volume for bitcoin declined sharply by 75% in January and as it declined so did market value.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com   The popularity of Bitcoin (BTC) continues declining since the start of this month after hitting its peak in December ($19,000). It has fallen back to below $10,000. As expected, the movement in Google search volume reflected the bitcoin price movement. So, why are popularity and price going down? Several factors contributed to the decline in bitcoin’s popularity; negative comments from numerous leaders and Central Banks during World Economic Forum weighed on traders sentiments and potential buyers. A Crack-down on digital currency from South Korea, India and China has also impacted the trading volume. South Korea and China have banned cryptocurrency trading through anonymous accounts, amid the threat of criminal activities and during the budget presentation speech, the Indian finance minister clearly denounced cryptocurrencies; “The government does not consider cryptocurrencies as legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate the use of these crypto assets in financing illegitimate activities.” Market pundits are also blaming other blockchain technologies for the decline in bitcoin’s popularity. For instance, several payment services companies are showing their confidence in Ripple (XRP) and other blockchain technologies, due to faster transactions times than bitcoin. Stripe, the online payments company, announced it would not support Bitcoin anymore, citing a number of reasons for this move. Stripe said, “Bitcoin transaction confirmation times have risen substantially; this, in turn, has led to an increase in the failure rate of transactions. … By the time the transaction is confirmed, fluctuations in Bitcoin price mean that it’s for the “wrong” amount. … Furthermore, fees have risen a great deal … making Bitcoin transactions about as expensive as bank wires.”    Featured Image: twitter",-1066.7599999999984,0

The country’s finance minister Arun Jaitley announced during the budget speech today that cryptocurrency was not considered legal tender in India. When the news broke, people immediately began blowing his words out of proportion. Jaitley stated that the Indian government “will take all measures to eliminate the use of these cryptoassets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payments system.” >> What crypto coins are best for making small payments? This doesn’t mean the Indian government is planning to outright ban Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They will continue to caution against it and are planning to severely crack down on the illegal activities that result from crypto. But a full-scale ban? Not quite yet. Many people appear to have interpreted it this way, however, and cryptos have taken a rough beating today as a result. Bitcoin is down nearly 10% in the last 24 hours, dropping below $10,000, and out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, only two coins are actually up (DigixDAO and Aeternity) at the time of writing. >> Aeternity makes the list of our 5 cryptocurrencies under $5 10% may not seem like a whole lot, but because Bitcoin holds such a large amount of the overall crypto market cap, the crypto market cap has plummetted as a result. In the course of 24 hours, the total crypto market cap has tanked by around $50 billion. What we have witnessed today is a pretty good display of what would probably happen was India to actually ban crypto. India accounts for nearly 10% of all Bitcoin transactions (coincidence that that is also the percentage that Bitcoin fell today?). If crypto loses India, that could severely damage the market. What is interesting is that India is against crypto, but not against blockchain. Jaitley also stated that “The Government will explore use of block chain technology proactively for ushering in digital economy.” So it’s not all doom and gloom. Blockchain will survive, even if crypto doesn’t. What do you think? Will India change its mind and ban crypto altogether?

The finance minister made it clear that the digital currencies are not Legal Tender and the Government will take all measures to eliminate the use of bitcoins in financing illegitimate activities. There was no mention of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies Ban in India. However, this is not a very good sign for investors in India since the Government is not clarifying doubts whether trading is legal or not. There is also no clarity on tax structure for bitcoins and cryptocurrencies. On the positive side, Suwon District Court in South Korea has recognized that bitcoin has economic value. Moreover, Samsung recently confirmed that they are working on developing hardware for cryptocurrency mining.  In Arizona, it seems like there are positive developments as lawmakers are pushing a proposal to allow residents in Arizona to pay their taxes in bitcoins.

USD 1.78m in membership fees. While arresting him, the Southern Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency confiscated his 216 Bitcoins (c. USD 2m) from an online wallet which received some fees from the site. Only last year, during the same case, the same court ruled that Bitcoin is not subject to confiscation. The court was quoted as saying, “It is not appropriate to confiscate Bitcoins because they are in the form of electronic files without physical entities, unlike cash […] Virtual currency can not assume an objective standard value,” by the Kyunghyang Shinmun news outlet. According to Chosun News, the court now said that, “the crime profit concealment law does not restrict the criminal income to the goods but the cash, the deposit, the stock, and other property with economic value.

Following a trial period involving a handful of users, the payment company launched bitcoin integration yesterday and saw a rise in stocks as a result. To accompany the launch, Square has also released a completely adorable Bitcoin tutorial in the style of a children’s book, titled ‘My First Bitcoin and the Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto‘. Through its colorful, pop-up artsy pages, the slideshow takes readers through the fundamental basics of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in terms an (albeit financially-minded) five-year-old could understand. Square CEO Jack Dorsey said in a tweet: “Instant buying (and selling, if you don’t want to hodl) of bitcoin is now available to most Cash App customers. We support Bitcoin because we see it as a long-term path towards greater financial access for all.” >> Turkish Soccer Team Purchases New Player With Bitcoin This is very good news for the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, which was recently dropped by online payment processor Stripe amid growing troubles with its use. Although today’s news still leaves bitcoin (BTC) in the red on coinmarketcap’s charts, Square’s stocks have risen around 3% in response. Square’s Cash app allows users to transfer funds on a person-to-person (P2P) or person-to-business basis, meaning you can pay a bill or send a friend $10. Today’s update will allow users to buy and deposit up to $10,000 USD worth of bitcoin per week, and with no additional purchase charge. In terms of pricing, Square will look across a range of exchanges to try and find an average. The only downside to all this is that technically, you don’t actually hold the bitcoin you use with Square; they do. >> Bitcoin Value Halves in January. What’s Next For the Cryptocurrency? Where bitcoins are traditionally held in a digital wallet tied to a device such as a computer, phone or even a memory stick, the coins a user owns on Square Cash are tied to their Square account, meaning they are out of the user’s hands to an extent. Some Bitcoin enthusiasts may argue that this counters the total financial freedom that Bitcoin is meant to endow. This does also present some upsides, however, as it means users can lose a device or their password and still recover their coins. In any case, crypto trading services are becoming increasingly popular as more begin to compete with Coinbase, the current standard. When trading service Robinhood announced it was to add zero-fee trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH), more than one million people signed up to the early-access waiting list. ‘Zero-fee’ is the buzzword here, as Coinbase typically charges 1.5 to 4 percent fees in the US. If Square can match this level of interest, it’s going to be a good year for the service, and possibly for cryptocurrency too. It certainly needs the rejuvenation.

The tiny Turkish soccer team has become the first in the world to purchase a payer using Bitcoin (BTC) or any cryptocurrency, making history. Club president Haldun Şehit proposed the deal, which amounts to a total of $1,197 USD, to player Ömer Faruk Kıroğlu, who agreed to play until the end of the season. The total amount comprises of 0.0524 BTC ($522.24 USD at the time of writing), and a further equivalent of $664.80 USD in cash. >> Soccer and Cryptocurrencies are starting to merge The deal is very small in comparison to what happens in other national leagues such as the UK’s Premier League, where signings regularly go for the equivalent of tens of millions of dollars. Indeed, Harunustaspor does not even compete in Turkey’s top football league, currently playing in the first division of Sakarya Amateur League. Yet today’s deal is still globally significant within the sport, which has been increasingly involved in cryptocurrency in recent weeks. Only last week, Arsenal signed a partnership deal with Cashbet Coin. Meanwhile, the London Football Exchange announced plans to launch its own cryptocurrency. With this in mind, Harunustapor’s offer may be small financially but it’s a huge step in terms of how digital currencies operate within sports. Quoted in Turkish-Football, Mr. Şehit said of the deal: “This is a first in Turkey and the world, and we are proud of this achievment.” Meanwhile, transferee Kıroğlu said: “This is the future. As someone open to new technology it made sense.” So what will happen going forward? No-one can really say. It could be that Harunustapor will be iconically known as the first soccer team to engage in a Bitcoin-based transfer. It could also mark the sport’s embrace of a new or alternative financial system. Or, it could simply blow over while things will carry on as usual. It’s hard to say, yet despite Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, in general, suffering big losses the past few weeks, soccer and other sports have embraced digital currency in some surprising and unlikely ways. An ICO token sale promoted by champion boxer Floyd Mayweather raised $30 million USD last year, while fans of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team will be able to purchase game tickets with Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) next season. This is not the first time that Turkey has pioneered cryptocurrency usage. Last month, it became the first country to settle a freight deal in Bitcoin between itself and a Russian ship delivering wheat.

Bulls provided a lot of support to Bitcoin (BTC) price by presenting different theories and hypothesis that it is becoming a million dollar investment, ultimately though, bears controlled the price since the start of this year.  Bitcoin started this month trading around the $14,000 level with the price hitting a monthly high of $17,500 on Jan 5. Since then, however, bitcoin’s value has declined at a sharp pace. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading around $10,300, down 6% in past 24 hours.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com There are two major reasons. The volatile nature of bitcoin’s price leading to panic sell-offs, and the possibility of cryptocurrency regulations. Overall, the huge volatility in bitcoin price has reduced its market capitalization to $171 billion. From its all-time high of $332 billion, this is a loss of almost half of its value. Although analysts are impressed by innovative blockchain technologies, the future of bitcoin depends highly on regulatory requirements. Several countries have begun deliberating about cryptocurrency regulations. >> The Uk and France are in talks to implement cryptocurrency regulations. Along with regulatory concerns and poor feedback from major analysts, the efficiency of bitcoin blockchain technology has significantly impacted the price. Stripe has announced an end to its support for the coin, while several other companies including MoneyGram, MercuryFX, and others have begun supporting Ripple’s xRapid product instead. Facebook has now also announced to ban ads promoting digital currencies, binary options, and initial coin offerings, warning: “They’re frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices.” The bitcoin crash amplified further since the start of this week, due to reports that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission sent subpoenas to Bitfinex and Tether, who claimed that the coin is backed by the dollar. Moreover, lower trading volume from South Korean markets after the implementations of new rules has added to traders concerns. The U.S. government has been showing their concerns for fake ICO’s; a number of companies are announcing initial coin offerings to raise the money without any business behind it. Useless Ethereum took the crypto market by storm last week, despite being totally useless. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced a strong crackdown on the illegal use of cryptocurrencies and fake ICO’s. The U.S. SEC has also announced to freeze all the assets of a Texas-based initial coin offering that claimed to have raised more than $600million.

The publication states that the process for the development of semiconductor ASIC was completed last year, and that mass production has started in January. “We are in the middle of a foundry business that is being supplied to a virtual money mining company in China,” a Samsung spokesperson confirmed, adding that the company was unsure how profitable the venture would prove to be. Taiwanese hardware giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company supplies the ASIC chips needed for cryptocurrency mining to Bitmain, a China-based Bitcoin mining company, and is the only other major semiconductor manufacturer to form a partnership with a Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer. Last year, Samsung used 40 old Galaxy phones to create a Bitcoin mining rig as part of an “upcycling” initiative intended to persuade customers to find new use cases for their old phones. The rig, of course, was mostly a curiosity, but it is an interesting development given that, according to this new information, Samsung was secretly developing ASIC chips at the time. This shows that chip manufacturers like Samsung are well aware of the prevalent use of their GPUs (graphics processing unit) for cryptocurrency mining by end users, and might be even focusing it with new designs.

There have been a number of prominent leaders joining in on the conversation surrounding the cryptocurrency industry lately. Last week, we heard from Howard Schultz, the chairman of Starbucks. Schultz stated that while he is a fan of cryptocurrency, he does not like bitcoin. Who do you agree with? Yesterday, The Hill published an opinion piece that featured the three-term senator. Gregg is cited as saying that he strongly believes that bitcoin, a virtual currency, has the potential to change the way that the world views currency.  In the exchange with The Hill, Judd Gregg compared bitcoin to gold. This comparison has been done a number of times both this year and last year. However, this time, Gregg stated that gold has value because it is accepted by banks, while bitcoin is only supported by shareholders beliefs.  >> Read More About What People Are Saying About Bitcoin When it comes to commercial transactions, Gregg stated that bitcoin has the potential to alter how the world views these transactions. It’s not entirely surprising that Gregg has come forward with this view, considering there are a number of politicians now coming to terms with the possibilities of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.  It’s not just Gregg and Schultz who have come forward with their views on bitcoin. From Katy Perry to Joseph Stiglitz, it seems everyone has something to say about the cryptocurrency sector. Not only that, but there have been a number of companies who have made a move into the blockchain technology industry. This is a cause for concern for some, as there is a decent amount of people who fear that people are investing in both bitcoin and blockchain without having a 100% grasp of the industries.  >> More Prominent Leaders Who Have Opened Up About Cryptocurrency Regardless of what people think, however, the industry seems to have a mind of its own.

Source: Facebook As a result of Facebook’s new policy, we won’t be able to see ads featuring people like “crypto genius” James Altucher, who has been featured in the media quite prominently because of his endorsement of the digital currency. Recently, Facebook has been a target of heavy criticism for hosting dubious ads that look to promote cryptocurrency. Some of these ads could potentially be associated with scams that are seemingly ubiquitous all over the internet right now. Many have pointed out that these ads use “fake information” to trick investors into putting money into “initial coin offerings”. >>BitConnect Officially Shuts Down — Ponzi Scheme Confirmed? Facebook is certainly not the only platform to host fraudulent promotions.  Recently, some investors were hoodwinked into buying a digital coin supposedly promoted by John McAfee — founder of cybersecurity firm McAfee — through his “official Twitter account”, only to find out later that the “tweet” they saw was actually sent from a bogus Twitter account with an almost identical Twitter handle as McAfee’s official one. This was just one of a myriad of cases where people got hoaxed into buying cryptocurrencies and became victims of such schemes in recent months. >>Nigerians Are Using An Old Approach To Beat Bitcoin Scams In its latest blog post, Facebook provided the following statement: “We want people to continue to discover and learn about new products and services through Facebook ads without fear of scams or deception. That said, there are many companies who are advertising binary options, ICOs and cryptocurrencies that are not currently operating in good faith.”  Today’s announcement marks another critical step in Facebook’s pathway to clean up its platform.

For instance, CryptoWatt, LLC, recently announced the purchase of MSE Technologies’ grounds and buildings in order to transform them into a mining operation likely to begin this March. Moreover, technology companies are making mining easier by developing chips for specifically for it. The low entry barrier will allow more arbitrageurs to start mining and this will substantially increase supply, beginning the decline of bitcoin miner’s profitability. The result will be modest profits against the cost of mining. Chairman and CEO Thomas Peterffy said, “a sharp bitcoin price decline could cause liquidity issues for the clearinghouses that could spread across financial markets and lead to a Lehman-style collapse.” >> The Next Global Hotspots for Bitcoin Mining Energy consumption is the major cost. Mining a single coin is eventually determined by how much the electricity spend is on operating a mining rig.

Danny Aston, 30, called the police to his home in Moulsford, Oxfordshire, at 9:40 am GMT on Monday after four masked robbers forced entry. The robbers reportedly demanded that Mr. Aston, an ex-financier-turned-Bitcoin-trader, transfer an unknown amount of Bitcoin to them before leaving the scene. No-one was injured in the event. Though the exact amount transferred has not been specified, it could be very large due to the nature of Mr. Aston’s work which involves his company: Aston Digital Currencies Ltd. >> Beware of the Bitcoin ATMs One mother told British newspaper The Mail on Sunday that she saw “Four young men in black tracksuits” approach Mr. Ashton’s property that day. Shortly after the incident, a local school was temporarily placed on lockdown as a police helicopter scoured the area, according to the Daily Mail. Thames Valley Police are asking for witnesses to come forward to aid in the thieves’ arrest, which will surely prove to be a challenge since Bitcoin is designed to be untraceable.

Cryptocurrencies started struggling after Coindesk reported that Tether had parted ways with its auditors. As a result, trader concerns have now been raised over whether Tether has artificially raised their value, which they said had been backed by the dollars. Nicholas Weaver – a professor at UC Berkeley’s International Computer Science Institute, said that a “true bloodbath” is likely if Tether couldn’t prove their value in actual dollars. He said: “At current prices, net new Bitcoin requires $18million of net new dollars flowing in to maintain the price… Yet there is a net $100million a day of fake dollars in the form of Tethers.” Bitcoin is trading at around $11,378 at the time of writing, down 4% from the previous day.

Made by indie developers Pro Social Games, the title now provides its players with the option of linking its fundamental dynamics to real-time movements in the price of bitcoin. With Bitcoin Mode chosen at the start of a new game, players will find that a rise (or fall) in bitcoin's value will confront them with more (or less) ""loot"" and with more (or less) fearsome enemies. Summing up these new features, Pro Social Games' founder Andrew Stafford told Cryptonews.com what would happen if bitcoin should ever crash to zero USD per coin: ""If this happened the enemies would drop to the lowest possible level, which in our case is 1."" Asked whether a bitcoin value of USD 100,000 would make the game ridiculously hard, Stafford replies: ""Yes, enemies would scale to the highest possible level in the game and would make life tough for the player."" While the current volatility of bitcoin could therefore make for some interesting gaming, it's clear that much of the rationale behind the decision to add a Bitcoin Mode is promotional.  ""This is the first step in drawing the interest of the crypto community,"" Stafford explains. ""Blockchain is a very new thing to a lot of people and Bitcoin is the big name that draws them."" Pro Social wouldn't be the first company to exploit bitcoin or the blockchain's reputation for commercial gain: in December, the shares of Long Island Ice Tea Corp. rose by 432% in a single day after the American soft-drinks company changed its name to Long Blockchain Corporation. That said, Stafford also confirmed that the developer's interest in cryptocurrency isn't focused only on PR.  ""We have big plans in the works for the implementation of our own cryptocurrency that drops in game,"" he reveals. How such a cryptocurrency might work wasn't outlined, yet Stafford was able to give some hint as to why Pro Social would be developing its own cryptocurrency rather than deepening its relationship with bitcoin.

This could have also been a factor in their refusal to go through a traditional bankruptcy. The bankruptcy trustee would have found out Bitfinex could have been cooking the books since the day they started and the losses would have been way more significant.” If all the ongoing drama continues, there are chances that bitcoin price could decline. USDT has a lot of weightage in trading cryptocurrencies. If something bad happens down the line, then altcoins could face a lot of selling pressure. On the other hand, South African Revenue Service (Sars) said to be working in tax structure for bitcoins and digital currencies with their plans to examine cryptocurrencies space much more cautiously. In addition, Bonnie Cheung, a venture partner at 500 Startups thinks that bitcoin is boring. While speaking to Bloomberg, Cheung compared bitcoin with a Motorola cell phone. She added: “The three key areas are right now scalability if you look at throughput Visa does about on average 2,000 transactions per second. PayPal can do around 500, bitcoin it’s seven, ethereum maxing out at about 50.” Clearly, she is referring to capacity and scalability problems of bitcoin. BTCUSD was down from the USD 12,200 high and is currently trading lower by 4.10% to USD 11,420. Ethereum too suffered losses and was down by 2.65% to trade near USD 1,200. However, ETHUSD remains supported on the downside near the USD 1,180 and USD 1,160 support levels.  Bitcoin price is currently under pressure and there is a possibility of it testing the USD 11,100 support zone. Below USD 11,100, the price could break the USD 11,000 level for further declines. On the upside, there is a strong resistance near USD 12,000 and USD 12,100. Other altcoins such as litecoin and ripple started a downside correction after an upside move. LTCUSD is currently down by 2.9% at USD 183.  Overall, the market is in a short-term correction mode. However, BTCUSD must stay above USD 11,100 to avoid further slides.",-459.10000000000036,0

Starting at the beginning of the year, the total market cap for all cryptocurrencies was just over $17 billion and at the end of December, it reached just under $600 billion. Bitcoin (BTC), the original cryptocurrency, from the year 2013 to the beginning of 2017, held almost 90% dominance of the total market.  Currently, BTC only holds 34.4% dominance. As cryptocurrency gained mainstream attention, Bitcoin slowly started losing the market cap dominance as individuals started buying up the less expensive coins to get their hands in the market. 2018 is shaping up to be the year of the altcoins, as you can see from the chart below. Bitcoin’s growth has slowed since it’s Bitcoin futures contracts launched on two Wall Street exchanges, mid-December. I would like to add, however, that BTC is still up over 1100% for the year in growth. Many who got in early investing in Bitcoin, made a serious profit last year. More BTC News >>  Source: CoinMarketCap As investors seek the “next Bitcoin”, Ethereum has held slow dominance. It was passed by Ripple (XRP) briefly two times in a years time, in May of 17′ and a week and a half ago. However, currently, it remains the clear second on the market by almost $60 billion. Both development teams on Bitcoin and the Ethereum network are facing the same issue, scalability. Transaction times on the Bitcoin blockchain have slowed exponentially and yesterday transaction times were around 2,000 minutes. The current fees associated with withdrawing Bitcoin and converting it to your fiat currency on Coinbase is currently around 60% (BTC/CAD). This is to cover the cost of the slow transaction time and the high fee. Bitcoin.org has even changed their website’s language, as you can see from the comparison photo below. The lightning network is the project that is supposed to speed up the current Bitcoin blockchain, by adding a “layer” to the top of it for micropayments. Its current test net is running and it is being used but has endured several bug issues. ETH News >>  Source: CCN Ethereum’s main development team is working on scaling the Ethereum blockchain by way of quadratic “sharding.” In a Github post posted two days ago, the founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, points out the specs as to what sharding will look like. He held a developer meeting recently and anticipated that the fourth phase should be completed “in a month and a bit.” “Then from there we’re going to try and shard it into a working test, a kind of test network,” Vitalik said. If the Ethereum team can get this up and functioning faster than the lightning network, this could mean big things for the cryptocurrency. As you can see from the chart below, Ethereum’s market cap is just under $84 billion from Bitcoin’s market cap and could very well pass the coin this year. What do you think?

This could well be happening in the future. During the company’s earnings call on Thursday, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) Chairman Howard Schultz provided his own personal view on the “fast brewing” cryptocurrency market, fully backing the potential and practicality of digital coins in the future. Starbucks in Argentina caught mining on customers’ laptops>> According to Schultz, there will be one or a few legitimate digital currencies based on the blockchain technology that consumers will be able to trust. “I’m talking about […] the possibility of what could happen — not in the near term, but in a few years from now — with a consumer application in which there’s trust and legitimacy with regard to a digital currency.” However, Schultz’s version of a digital currency world excludes Bitcoin, the No. 1 cryptocurrency right now. Like many business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos had mentioned this week, the Starbucks executive does not consider Bitcoin to be a legitimate currency. “I don’t believe that bitcoin is going to be a currency today or in the future. I’m talking about the new technology of blockchain and the possibility of what could happen not in the near terms, but in a few years from now,” added Schultz. 5 cryptocurrencies under $5>> Despite being confident in the technology, Schultz reiterated that his company has no specific plans to launch its own cryptocurrency right now and it’s still trying to understand the crypto world. Even so, we can’t rule out the possibility that Starbucks may test out a virtual currency in the near future, as today’s statements pretty much confirm that the company is headed in that direction. This is not the first time Schultz has brought up the idea of a cashless payment system. In a CNBC interview last month, he mentioned that he could envision a future where the coffee chain becomes a “cashless retailer” and believes “that time is nearer than you think.” Read about the largest crypto hack ever>> Featured Image: Twitter ",-84.60000000000036,0

Moreover, cryptocurrencies’ ability to execute transactions semi-anonymously has added to the popularity. Consequently, people who want their transactions to be hard to trace enjoy the secrecy these digital currencies offer. According to researchers from the University of Sydney, almost 44% of Bitcoin transactions were used for illegal purposes and 25% of all traders used Bitcoin for illicit reasons. The research further shows that these Bitcoin traders are expected to make close to 36 million transactions each year. Do KYCs make the crypto market unfair? >> “Our paper suggests that a significant component of the intrinsic value of bitcoin as a payment system derives from its use in facilitating illegal trade,” the researcher said. The researchers’ findings certainly seem true. The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has declined from $830 billion to around $550 billion in the last couple of weeks, driven down by regulatory concerns that may, in part, be resulting from this illegal activity. Beware the Bitcoin ATM >> Bitcoin is currently selling at $10,922 after briefly dipping below the $10,000 mark on regulatory worries last week. The latest selloff has reduced Bitcoin’s total market capitalization to $183 billion, down significantly from the all-time high of $330 billion.   On the other hand, several fund managers believe the movement in Bitcoin price is purely based on speculation and that the coin does not have any underlying value or future fundamentals. The chief executive of Vanguard, Tim Buckley,  said, “Bitcoin’s value is based off scarcity, an artificial scarcity that’s out there.” He further added, “It’s really tough to imagine where the long-term returns come from, other than speculation.” 5 cryptocurrencies under $5 >> Ripple (XRP) is among those cryptocurrencies that are likely to create its own underlying value. Ripple continues to make partnerships with payment services companies to improve their transaction time and reduce the transaction charges. After the announcement of the partnership with MoneyGram,  IDT Corporation and Mercury FX are planning to use Ripple’s xRapid product for certain transactions.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, US treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, stated that ""we want to make sure that they're not used for illicit activities”. Similarly, Theresa May raised issues of rising use of cryptocurrencies. The US follows strict rules and laws to ensure that exchanges in the US which are offering trades in bitcoin and digital currencies follow all important anti-money laundering rules. However, there are many countries which are still very far in cracking down bitcoin and altcoins.  Bitcoin price was in trouble today as it traded lower by more than 6.8% to USD 10,580. It broke an important support at USD 11,000, which has cleared the path for more declines. ETH also was under pressure along with NEO and LTC. Litecoin was down by 6.4% to trade near USD 170. Bitcoin cash also suffered losses as it traded close to the USD 1500 level.  In a surprising statement, cryptocurrency 'Oracle' Lingham in an interview to CNBC stated that he thinks bitcoin cash may overtake bitcoin in the near future. He added saying: ""When I look at it from the product standpoint, I think the greater demand is for peer-to-peer cash than for digital gold”. In altcoins arena,ICON Mainnet Launch was a huge success. ICX is one of the most talked about altcoins lately. One of the other altcoins, DigixDAO, gained heavily today. DGD was up by around 48% to trade above the USD 275 level.

Possibly, this is the first freight deal done in a cryptocurrency, per Bloomberg. PSF is trying to develop “a cross-border payment system that’s easier and faster than what’s available now”, Bloomberg reported, citing PSF’s Chief Executive Officer Ivan Vikulov.  Vikulov hopes the company’s trial can lead to processing freight deals more fluidly through cryptocurrency usage. During the research and development of the project, PSF has partnered with Quorum Capital and Interchart LLC, a ship management service. According to Bloomberg, “Prime Shipping Foundation is seeking to get a banking license in Gibraltar, one of the most crypto-friendly jurisdictions”, in order to make conversions between fiat and crypto easier. Because of crypto’s market volatility, Vikulov said they would allow hedging. They are developing their own cryptocurrency, with plans to raise funds for it mid-2018.

The reviews online are overwhelmingly negative; however, it must not be forgotten that the purpose of these ratings is to “help protect investors from risk, while leading them to the most sustainable, robust cryptocurrencies”, as it says in their statement on why Bitcoin is not an A. The Weiss ratings placed ethereum and EOS cryptocurrencies ahead of bitcoin, as reported by Cryptonews.com today. No currency garnered a top score of A, but there were B ratings for both ethereum and EOS, with bitcoin receiving a “fair” rating of C+. Weiss claimed bitcoin “falls short in two important areas: risk and technology,” although it admitted bitcoin was strong in terms of adoption and branding.  Reddit, an American news aggregation and discussion website, user u/CrzyJek has taken to the popular r/cryptocurrency subreddit to explain why Weiss ratings “is a sham and complete utter garbage”. The user cites his sources diligently, quoting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in their prosecutions of Weiss for “fraudulent, misleading statements, as well as engaging in insider pump & dump though their listings”.  Those sources were a cease and desist letter from 2006, and an order approving distribution plan from 2009. He concludes that, “Weiss ratings is a long standing pump & dump operation who makes propitious picks based largely on which securities the owners currently hold, and who, prima facia [sic], had a few years of self-proclaimed legitimacy, yet were later exposed as shilling their own picks to pump their stocks.” Other users on the same subreddit urge against taking the Weiss ratings seriously: “If the reports are freely available read them and analyze their findings but don't take them as gospel. Give them a credibility level similar to a well researched blog post [...] I suspect that [the reports] are mostly a PR stunt to increase the visibility of Weiss Ratings and maybe sell some subscriptions/reports.” Reddit User u/atworkmeir proposes to “take it with several grains of salt. Maybe the whole shaker.” As this is the first cryptocurrency rating available, it must be taken into consideration that perhaps, Weiss holds the cryptocurrency market to the same standards as the stock market, even though they are not strictly comparable, at least for the moment. Weiss said, “Ratings are not a science. They are, and always will be, a work in progress.” In addition to the negative reviews, Weiss has been hit with a spate of cyberattacks it says came “from Korea”, also as reported by Cryptonews.com.",-162.3000000000011,0

At the World Economic Forum annual meeting taking place this week in Davos, Switzerland, he told Bloomberg reporters that bitcoin serves no function other than being useful in illicit activities such as money laundering and tax evasion. Just yesterday, Bill Browder spoke out about the ‘death of bitcoin‘! His rationale is based on his belief that bitcoin is no better than the dollar as a medium of exchange, and the cryptocurrency is basically there to solve a problem that never existed. “We have a good medium of exchange called the dollar,” stated Stiglitz. “We can trade in that. Why do people want bitcoin? For secrecy.“ The economist explained that the global banking system is already implementing digital payment technologies, so having bitcoin is just unnecessary. On top of reiterating his aversion for the cryptocurrency, Stiglitz also called for bitcoin to be regulated. “My feeling is that when you regulate it so that you couldn’t engage in money laundering and all these other things, there would be no demand for bitcoin,” he added. “So by regulating the abuses, you are going to regulate it out of existence.” Stiglitz was also joined by Swiss National Bank chairman Thomas Jordan, who gave a speech on why tough restrictions should be placed on bitcoin. “There is an important principle: Similar activities should be similarly regulated, and bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have some characteristics of other investment instruments,” Jordan told listeners. In a previous interview conducted in November 2017, Stiglitz condemned the cryptocurrency and said it was “successful only because of its potential for circumvention [and] lack of oversight.” Stiglitz is only one of many famous economists to be super skeptical of bitcoin. Last year, Robert Shiller, another Nobel Prize winner, described bitcoin as “the best example of a bubble” and considered its valuation “exceptionally ambiguous.” Here’s what others in the financial world are saying about bitcoin.

But little do we know is that some of his vast wealth (despite controversies surrounding his bankruptcy filing in 2015) can now be attributed to bitcoin. Back in 2014, 50 Cent became the first in the industry to accept bitcoin as payment for his album “Animal Ambition.” At that time, bitcoin was valued only around $662 per BTC. According to a report by TMZ, 50 Cent collected approximately 700 bitcoins from album sales — equivalent to about $420,000. In an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session on Reddit following the album release, 50 Cent talked about accepting bitcoin as a way to “stay with the times.” Seeing how bitcoin’s value shot up over the past year, we can probably guess how much money the rapper has made since acquiring the coins. Even at a floor price of $10,000 per BTC, 50 Cent’s coins would have a value of $7 million. Essentially, he has made millions of dollars from collecting bitcoins from his 2014 album sale. 50 Cent has been known for making shrewd investments in the past. Over a decade ago, the rapper bought a minority stake in Vitamin Water, which was subsequently acquired by Coca-Cola for $4.1 billion in 2007. 50 Cent reportedly walked away with somewhere between $60 million and $100 million from that deal. Delighted by the latest revelation, 50 Cent even posted a screenshot of the TMZ article on his Instagram feed. Commenting on the Instagram post, he wrote: “Not Bad for a kid from South Side, I’m so proud of me.”  Given that bitcoin hasn’t been doing too well lately and its price is still volatile, it might be a good idea for him to cash out while the opportunity is there, as suggested by TMZ.

However, Wuyts is skeptical as to the value of Bitcoin. “I didn’t win thousands of euros, I won one Bitcoin,” he says. “I will probably cash it out, because I have my doubts about the long-term value of this cryptocurrency”. One of his followers on Twitter reacted to this: 
“You will regret it a lot in the future if you sell it. Look at it this way: it is worth less than 10k now. That's just a few months of pay for your level of education. It's meaningless. But what if you are wrong about its future? Then it will make a difference”.  The challenge had been issued on January 21, 2015, at a World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland. The deadline was to be January 21, 2018 - exactly three years later. In that time, the price of Bitcoin increased from USD 230 to c. USD 10,000, as at the press time. At the meeting, Goldman explained a new method of storing digital information in DNA. To prove the merit of this, Goldman distributed test tubes containing samples of DNA encoding one Bitcoin to the audience (and subsequently posted samples to people who requested them). The first person to read the DNA and decode the files it contained could take possession of the Bitcoin. According to the Institute, “all they needed was the sample, access to a DNA sequencing machine and a grasp of how the code works.” Wuyts, the PhD student who won the challenge, only started working on it after seeing a tweet about the deadline in early December 2017. The hard work paid off with only a week to go before time was up: on January 16, he published a blog post on cracking the code, with step-by-step, highly technical explanations.

Stripe product manager Tom Karlo released a gentle-yet-cutting blog post this afternoon outlining the company’s decision to break up with the world’s largest cryptocurrency. ‘Over the past year or two,’ he explains, ‘Bitcoin has evolved to become better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange.’ Not entirely useful for a payment application, therefore. Karlo goes on to explain that ‘substantially’ higher transaction times and an increase in failure rates have led to a decrease in customer desire to use the coin on the Stripe platform. Ouch. >>Bitcoin Now In ‘Bubble Territory’, Warns Goldman Sachs This is in stark contrast to four years ago when Stripe made headlines after announcing it would be the first major online payment platform with Bitcoin integration back in March 2014. The news comes amid a turbulent couple of weeks which has seen the cryptocurrency market as a whole take a beating. Governments have begun introducing legislation to regulate digital currency trading, causing investors to step back. But don’t start writing a furious e-mail just yet. For those of you who trade frequently with Bitcoin via Stripe, there is still plenty of time to make some last-minute transactions. The company is entering a ‘wind-down’ phase with Bitcoin support, working with affected users to ensure a ‘smooth transition’ before they stop processing the currency completely on April 23rd, 2018. In addition, Stripe remain ‘very optimistic about cryptocurrencies overall’, and suggest that they are interested in enabling support for ‘promising’ cryptocurrency efforts in the future. So it’s not all doom and gloom. >>Proof-of-Stake Can Save Cryptocurrency Stripe, like Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL), is an online payment system whereby users can accept transfers online and in mobile apps.

Not everyone is willing to share their thoughts with the masses, especially about something that is so new and so controversial. Is bitcoin a speculative bubble or is it not? There are different indications every day but, there are others who have pretty strong opinions. Former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair, Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller, and even JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon have all shared their thoughts. So who else is speaking out? The latest to speak out about the virtual currency is Bill Browder, the CEO of Hermitage Capital, which is an investment fund company that focuses primarily on Russian markets. In an interview with CNBC, Mr. Browder stated that he knows what the death of bitcoin will be.  There are a lot of people hoping bitcoin will fail, and there are a lot of people guessing in what way will the cryptocurrency come to the end of its life, and Browder, while not a pessimist, believes that there are a few reasons which suggest that bitcoin will one day come to an end.  In particular, Browder stated that bitcoin is “a way for bad dictators or criminals to bypass sanctions.” Translation? Bitcoin can be incredibly useful when it comes to criminal activity, while, in turn, will be “the death of it and other cryptocurrencies.”  He added that there will come a point in time where cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin, will lose all that makes them so appealing to investors right now.  Browder has a point. Bitcoin, because it is not regulated, is susceptible to money laundering and other sorts of criminal activity, which is why there are certain countries fighting for more regulation over the virtual currency.  Every day is different. Sometimes bitcoin is dropping, other times it looks like it’s making a comeback. Today is the latter.  At the time of writing, bitcoin managed to climb its way above the $11,000 mark today, after dropping marginally in the early hours of the morning.  Personally, it’s hard to say the direction that bitcoin is heading in the next couple weeks. For the sake of investors, I hope that it continues to gain momentum.

Today, Goldman Sachs issued a warning against the cryptocurrency, affirming that there is “no doubt” that bitcoin’s meteoric rise over the past year has “pushed it into bubble territory.” Goldman Sachs also compared last year’s bitcoin frenzy to the renowned dot-com era of the late 1990s and the Dutch “tulipmania” of the 17th century. The investment banking firm believes that this “bitcoin bubble” could get much bigger than its historical comparables.  Source: MarketWatch Analysts at Goldman Sachs view the extreme price volatility of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin as a big indication that a big crash could be on the cards. They also pointed out that as the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, bitcoin does not actually fulfil the role it sets out to do. In a research report issued to investors, Goldman Sachs analysts stated: “We think the concept of a digital currency that leverages blockchain technology is viable given the benefits it could provide: ease of execution globally, lower transaction costs, reduction of corruption since all transactions could be traced, safety of ownership, and so on. But bitcoin does not provide any of these key advantages.” According to the report, the difference in bitcoin prices between exchanges at the same time could reach as high as $4,000 just because a single bitcoin transaction takes a long time to process. This means a buyer could be paying 31% more for one BTC on one exchange than another. In addition to bitcoin, Goldman Sachs also gave a similar verdict on other cryptocurrencies such as ether and ripple. “While we do not know if bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency will double or triple from prevailing prices, we do not believe that these cryptocurrencies will retain their value in the long run in their current incarnation,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. However, the good news is that Goldman Sachs is still positive about the blockchain technology in general and is considering building a trading platform for bitcoin. As well, analysts do not expect a major crash in bitcoin to cause “major contagion effects on the global economy or financial markets.“ Featured Image: twitter",-76.10000000000036,0

Bitcoin is owned by the crowd, its users and it has now a track record of several years, enough for it to be “an animal in its own right”, according to Taleb.  The problem with centralized currency and its subsequent impact as Taleb sees it is that, “not only the expert is not an expert, but he doesn’t know it. That previous Federal Reserve bosses, Greenspan and Bernanke, had little grasp of empirical reality is something we only discovered a bit too late [...] which is why we need to be careful on who to endow with centralized macro decisions.” Taleb further concludes that Bitcoin’s structural design is what could make “a zero intelligence crowd [work] better than a Soviet-style management composed to maximally intelligent humans.”  He does not reject the notion that Bitcoin might fail - but is positive in his belief that, should it fail, we, as a society, would simply invent an improved version as an insurance against “an Orwellian future.”",-76.10000000000036,0

The Financial Services Commission in South Korea took a major step and introduced a new rule for cryptocurrency transactions and trading. They banned the use of anonymous bank accounts for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies related trading and transactions.  Speaking at the government complex in Seoul, South Korea, South Korea's Financial Services Commission vice Chair, Kim Yong-Beom, stated that a new system will be introduced soon, which will enable local banks to stop anonymous transactions related to bitcoin trading.  He added that “cryptocurrency exchanges that are in danger of being exploited for money laundering will be thrown out of the market”.  It means these steps will help regulatory firms to prevent money laundering criminal activities in South Korea using bitcoins and cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin price was down roughly 11.88% to USD 10,344. Other major cryptocurrencies also declined sharply, including ether and ripple. ETH traded lower by 12.12% to USD 950. It is now trading below the USD 980 support level and it may continue to decline in the near future. 
The next major support in ETH/USD is at USD 920. Similarly, XRP was down 8.2% to USD 1.24 and is currently holding the USD 1.20 support. Should there be a break below the USD 1.20 support, ripple price could test the USD 1.10 level. Recently in the US, Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Bob Menendez (D-NJ) cautioned Trump administration on Venezuelan Regime's 'petro' cryptocurrency plans. In anopen letter to Secretary Mnuchin, they mentioned: “As such, we are concerned that a cryptocurrency could provide Maduro a mechanism by which to make payments to foreign lenders and bondholders in the United States, actions that would clearly thwart the intent of U.S.-imposed sanctions.” One of the five questions asked by Senators was “Does the Department have effective enforcement mechanisms to follow and counter the use of cryptocurrencies?” Clearly, there is a lot happening in the cryptocurrency arena, putting a lot of pressure on bitcoin price below the USD 11,000 level. Going forward, BTC/USD could test the USD 10,000 level if the current market sentiment fails to ease in the short term.",-76.10000000000036,0

Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $10,000 USD on January 17th, for the first time since December 1st (though it is now recovering), and Coinmarketcap has been a sea of red, prompting many reports to describe it as the cryptocurrency ‘bloodbath’. Hyperbolic, maybe, but scary enough if you’ve just invested all the money you were saving up to buy a yacht with.  It’s all very interesting, but amongst all the noise it’s easy to overlook an even more concerning development taking shape within the cryptocurrency industry; one that no amount of smart trading or governmental regulation will fix if we leave it too late.  As we all know, Bitcoins do not come from out of nowhere. Like gold, oil, coal and other valuable commodities, it must be mined. In this case, using computers. And computers tend to use electricity. In fact, according to the Digiconomist’s energy consumption index, Bitcoin mining computers got through around 43.74TWh per year worth of the stuff as of today. To put that into perspective, many members of the Bitcoin community paid some attention to a research paper from UK-based Powercompare last November, which stated that at the time, electricity usage for Bitcoin mining equated to 0.13% of the entire planet’s energy consumption. This is more than the country of Ireland uses per year. It is more than Nigeria, Africa’s largest economy, uses per year. It is more than 159 other countries in the world use per year. ‘If Bitcoin miners were a country’, say Powercompare, ‘they’d rank 61st in the world in terms of energy consumption.’ All of this speaks for itself, but it’s old news. Because at the time the paper was released, Bitcoin’s energy consumption stood at 29.05TWh. That means that since late November 2017, less than two months ago, the amount of power used by Bitcoin mining has increased by 50.5%. That is an unbelievable increase in such a short amount of time, and it’s rising exponentially.  
Uh-oh. Source As of 28th November 2017, Bitcoin energy use had increased by just under 30% that past month. At that rate, it would consume the entire world’s energy supply by 2020. Considering today’s statistic, this is getting alarming.  If environmental issues don’t tend to worry you, consider that not only is this bad for the planet, it’s bad for trading. China’s recent power restrictions on mining operations is putting pressure on miners who want to continue producing coins. Bitmain, one of China’s leading mining companies, is planning on leaving the country and setting up elsewhere due to the regulations. And even if all the miners do move elsewhere, would other countries happily accommodate such high power demand for long? Okay, you get it, it’s a problem. So what do we do about it? The issue with Bitcoin’s protocol is that it uses what’s known as a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm. In essence, this means that every miner must do ‘work’ (using computing power to solve a mathematical problem in order to produce more coins and complete transactions) to add new blocks onto the blockchain system. A block is ‘solved’ every 10 minutes, and out of everyone who tried, only one miner succeeds. They then get the transaction fees and new coins as a reward. The others are informed and their work discarded, despite the colossal power that went into trying to solve the math problem first.  But there is an alternative. Other consensus algorithms, such as proof-of-stake, exist to do essentially the same thing in a different way. With proof-of-stake (PoS), one user (called a ‘forger’ in POS terms) is chosen from a pool to create the next block on the chain, instead of everyone frantically trying to solve a math problem and do it first. This saves an enormous amount of energy. Forgers are chosen based on the stake they have in the system – the number of coins they have and how long they have had them for. They are not rewarded by coins created but they are paid in transaction fees.  And it’s catching on. In fact, some well-known coins with huge market caps have been using PoS for ages. NEO, which normally sits comfortably among the top 10 cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap, currently has a cap of $7.6 billion USD, while the developer-based coin Lisk (LSK) sits on a cap of $2.3 billion USD. Both coins run on a PoS-based algorithm, and, though suffering the same general market price plummet that most cryptocurrencies are, have more value and trading volume than many PoW-based coins. Up-and-coming alt-coins have spotted the benefits of PoS, too. Philosopher Stones (PHS) coins ranked amongst the top three highest gaining coins on January 17th, while reaching a market cap of $1.63m USD later that week, a stunning increase from $459k a couple of days before. Philosopher Stones use the proof-of-stake algorithm as part of their ‘green mining’ initiative, noting that ‘the only equipment you need for minting new coins is your PC or even laptop’. Interestingly, they allow transaction messages on their blockchain network and also offer a 50% year return reward.  Coinmarketcap.com, 17/01/2018 Also, enter EcoCoin (ECO). It is smaller than PHS with a market cap of $235,161 USD but no less ambitious. It, too, uses Proof-of-Stake to validate its transactions. The coin is, in their own words, ‘a cryptocurrency and community focused on protecting and honoring our environment.’ It’s strongly unlikely that this will take the form of storming oil tankers á la Greenpeace, so don’t put off your investments just yet. Since launching, they have made a good deal of progress through their roadmap, establishing Windows and Linux wallets, listing on multiple exchanges and celebrating their website launch. Looking to become a platform for charity donations, recycling rewards, crowd-sourcing and an eco-marketplace, EcoCoin is designed to be a PoS-based coin with a huge audience.     But even if your heart is set on PoW-based coins such as Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin, there are still ways to mine them without pushing national grids to the limit. HydroMiner, an Austrian-based Bitcoin mining operation, is making use of disused hydropower reserves in the country to power their servers. In addition, equipment is cooled by the cold mountain water circulating through pipes – a more efficient alternative than conventional air conditioning. Excitingly, they are currently planning an ICO to expand outside of Austria. We also have Pylon Network, an ingenious Spanish start-up which looks to reward users in its own cryptocurrency for solar power generation. The blockchain-enabled platform will enable the decentralized exchange of green energy for Pylon-coin. In addition, validating transactions will take place with ‘green miners’; servers that are run on excess renewable energy.  It’s easy to overlook the smaller coins and ICOs that are trying to push the industry in a different direction. But it’s all the more reason to think about investing now, while prices are low. It is normal to have doubts about economic viability, but it might be time to start thinking about the bigger picture; whether the giant PoW-based coins are actually sustainable in real terms. In any case, the issue of power consumption is in everyone’s hands, and if it isn’t paid immediate attention, Bitcoin will be the least of our worries.

Though it is one of the biggest cryptocurrency hotbeds on the planet, Nigeria’s bitcoin mania actually took off because of an infamous Ponzi scheme that roped in millions of Nigerians from late 2015 to the end of 2016. The Mavrodi Mondial Moneybox (MMM) scam, which first started in Russia and lasted as long as 30 years, promised investors a 30% return in as little as 30 days. When the Nigerian government started cracking down on accounts linked with the scheme, MMM operators were able to cut out the banks and started to require investors to use bitcoins. At the end of 2016, MMM suspended its payouts to investors, causing an estimated three million people in Nigeria to lose their money. But out of all that chaos, something fascinating happened: people realized that bitcoin was just as valuable as money — that bitcoin is the future. According to Lucky Uwakwe, co-founder of Blockchain Solutions Ltd., a cryptocurrency firm in Lagos: “It was MMM that made Nigerians understand how Bitcoin worked.” Today, Nigerians are trading about $4.7 million worth of bitcoin a week, up from about $300,000 per week a year ago. This number puts Nigeria at No. 23 globally, comparable to the volume of activity in Chinese yuan or Indian rupees. “The growth has been crazy,” said David Ajala, who runs NairaEx, one of about a dozen digital currency exchanges in Nigeria. “It took us two years to get 10,000 customers. Within the last year, we’ve added 90,000.” Because of Nigeria’s high fraud rates, online sellers do not process payments from Nigerian credit cards. This is why bitcoin has become an attractive option for consumers there. With bitcoin, there aren’t any costly chargebacks, and on the basis of transaction origin, it can’t be blocked. The majority of Nigerians keep it as an alternative asset class by using it as a store of value. In addition, as many emerging market currencies are struggling against the U.S. dollar, investors began using bitcoin as a hedge against the local currency depreciation. Bitcoin Scams are Prevalent in Nigeria MMM was just one of the many scams to flood a nation that’s notorious for criminal activities of this sort. With bitcoin quickly gaining popularity, the rise of scams involving the cryptocurrency was inevitable. Phony traders have inundated Nigeria’s cryptocurrency exchanges, messaging apps, and even the streets of every city in Nigeria, pledging fast and guaranteed returns to civilians and disappearing once they’ve taken their money. “A lot of people have had their fingers burned,” said Adeolu Fadele, founder of the Cryptographic Development Initiative of Nigeria, a group that aims to educate regulators and the public about digital currency. Most of these scams follow the same pattern: a potential victim would receive a message from a supposedly beleaguered Nigerian prince, and the target is asked to wire over money in exchange for bitcoin. In some cases, the scammer uses the ID of a real dealer and creates a trading profile on a local exchange that’s good enough to pass a cursory background check, a technique known as cloning. Others will make an offer not of bitcoin, but of “billion coin” or some other non-existent cryptocurrency. “Everybody I know has been scammed in one way or another,” says Bashir Aminu, a digital-security expert and bitcoin enthusiast in Lagos. Like in any other Ponzi scheme, the early investors in Nigeria’s bitcoin scams get paid with the money coming from subsequent investors. Since this kind of manoeuvre relies on new sign-ups, the scheme would collapse if no new investors are drawn in. To combat these scams involving something that’s not properly regulated, Nigeria has started developing informal groups of traders and follow an old-school approach to verify transactions. For instance, after seeing his friends lose thousands of dollars to scammers, bitcoin fanatic Aminu set up an informal exchange on the messaging app Telegram that would allow him and his friends to trade among themselves. Anyone else who seeks to join the group would need to go through a review procedure, where Aminu would look at their ID and banking documents and compare the papers in face-to-face meetings. Sometimes, he would even act as a trusted broker, holding a buyer’s money in escrow until the seller came through with the bitcoin transfer. According to Aminu, his group has grown to almost 800 members over the past year, and there are dozens of similar networks out there. Some networks arrange face-to-face meetings in homes, the backs of small shops, and other private places, where a buyer hands over cash and watches the seller make the bitcoin transfer over a smartphone. This kind of facilitation is pretty similar to those black market exchanges taking place all over the streets of Nigeria. As these informal networks grow and multiply, they would become increasingly populated by people who trade digital currency as a full-time occupation. Because of all of this informal trading, the size of Nigeria’s market is probably even bigger than what’s being reported. The emergence of informal networks in Nigeria has fortified the value of not just bitcoin but cryptocurrency in general to Nigerian investors, especially as the local currency continues to undergo wild swings. “For many, the potential profit is too good to pass up,” said Smart Oluwadola, a cryptocurrency peddler in Kano, a desert city in northern Nigeria. In August, a friend persuaded him to ditch a job hawking health supplements for a suspiciously pyramidal “business club” and buy a couple hundred dollars’ worth of bitcoin. His investment is now worth thousands of dollars.  “If you don’t take a risk, you can’t get anything,” said Oluwadola. “And if it’s going to be the future of currency, then you better start now.” As those living in any politically and economically unstable country could tell you, anything that leads to money entails its fair share of deceptions and unlawfulness that the government would rather turn a blind eye to, let alone fix. The cryptocurrency enthusiasts in Nigeria are doing everything possible to make sure this market is clean and absent of fraudulence — even it means following the most primitive and uninspiring method possible.

After last weekend failed to reinvigorate the market, many enthusiasts will be wondering where to look for some positive news. It may be on the way… Russia is a bit of a lone wolf as far as politics are concerned. As cryptocurrencies begin to tug at the strings of national and international affairs, the country will surely be thinking carefully about how to play its hand in regards to crypto regulation. Speculation abounded last year as Russian president Vladimir Putin met with Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin as part of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. Mr. Putin allegedly “supported the idea of establishing ties with possible Russian partners,” which, though vague, sounds positive.  >>Are Institutional Investors to Blame for the Latest Bitcoin Sell Off? In addition, Dmitry Marinichev, Mr. Putin’s internet advisor, is a huge supporter of Bitcoin. Indeed, news of his huge mining operation, located in an old Soviet car factory, garnered interest last year. Russia may be an ideal location for Bitcoin mining, given the long, cold winters (great for keeping the hardware cool) and cheap electricity. People are beginning to notice. As China continues to put pressure on crypto miners in the country, many of them are starting to see Russia as an appealing alternative. According to a November 2017 report by Bitcoin News, 40 companies from China and the EU have sent applications to the Russian Association of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (RACIB) to begin mining operations in the country.  All this being said, it is inevitable that Russia will place some regulations on cryptocurrency. Even the most financially liberal country is bound to be uncomfortable with totally unregulated flows of cash, particularly where large corporations are concerned. And Russia has certainly been very sceptical in the past, going so far as to consider jail time of up to 7 years for cryptocurrency users back in 2016. And as recently as October 2017, Russia’ central bank announced plans to restrict access to online cryptocurrency exchange websites. Despite all this, nothing concrete seems to have come to fruition yet. So what’s going on?  In recent weeks, Putin certainly seems to have come to a more level conclusion on the subject. According to Russian news agency TASS, Putin last week said that some kind of regulation will ‘definitely’ be required in future, though he acknowledged that Bitcoin et al “can be a settlement medium to a certain degree and in certain situations. This is done quickly and efficiently.” >>Bitcoin or Gold? Why Investors Should Consider Both in the Current Market Evidently, Russia is staying their hand on cryptocurrency regulation for the moment, and it is no coincidence that it is reportedly developing its own in the meantime. The so-called ‘cryptorouble’ being developed by the Kremlin will likely be investigated as a way to conduct global exchanges of cash while bypassing international sanctions. In addition, the Bank of Russia last year announced that it is now working with masterchain technology. Deputy Governor Olga Skorobogatova said: “We are planning to consider the use of the Masterchain prototype as a component of the new-generation financial infrastructure in the future.” This certainly suggests that the country is seeing the benefits of cryptocurrency and the innovations it comes with. In any case, the term ‘regulation’ is getting increasingly warped within cryptocurrency circles. While it is true that market prices take steep dives every time a country introduces new legislation to control the use of Bitcoin and its rivals, it does not necessarily mean an outright ban or threat of criminal charges. Russia’s Ministry of Finance announced that it was drafting a bill to regulate, or ‘legalize’, Bitcoin trading on certain platforms last December, with Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev stating that it “supports the legalization of trade on official exchanges”, despite it not being technically illegal at the moment…  If all of this sounds extremely contradictory, that’s because it is. The Kremlin has constantly altered its stance on cryptocurrency over the past couple of years, but presently it seems as though it’s beginning to reach some kind of conclusion. Russia’s headstrong approach in world affairs may see it taking a more lax attitude to cryptocurrencies as the West mulls over tighter control. The coming months will tell. Bitcoin currently has a market cap of $173,643,993,145 USD and is currently trading at $10,323.80 USD, down -9.68% from yesterday.  Featured Image: Twitter",-701.7000000000007,0

A brief rally over the weekend sent bitcoin prices from below $10,000 to $13,000. However, this was short-lived; the bitcoin price collapsed again during Monday trade. Traders blamed regulatory concerns from South Korea, India, and the European Union for the latest plummet. Currently trading at just above $11,500, Bitcoin is down 11% from the previous close.  Several Indian banks have suspended cryptocurrency exchange accounts in order to control money laundering and the transfer of money from India to other destinations. The Indian finance minister, Arun Jaitley, has already denounced digital currencies and the government is now taking necessary actions to stop cryptocurrency trading. In a bid to control the massive growth in cryptocurrency prices, the European Union has signaled strong initiatives to end the bitcoin bubble. Valois Dombrovskis, vice president of the European Commission, has cited “clear risks for investors and consumers associated to price volatility”. The European Union has appointed Central bank Deputy Governor Jean-Pierre Landau to suggest ways to regulate digital currencies. In a separate report, Nordea Bank, the largest Northern European financial services group, has banned their employees from cryptocurrency trading. Although South Korea hasn’t yet announced a complete ban on cryptocurrency trading, they have implemented new taxes on cryptocurrencies. Several investors are pleased with the government’s decision of introducing taxes instead of banning the digital currencies. According to reports, the country has imposed a 22% corporate tax and a 2.2% local income tax on cryptocurrency exchanges. They have recently banned anonymous cryptocurrency accounts and prohibited foreign traders to trade virtual currencies in South Korean exchanges. The country has also frozen the opening of new virtual accounts. Despite mixed signals from the South Korean markets, investors are currently showing their concerns over India, which has completely suspended cryptocurrency trading accounts.     Featured Image: twitter",-701.7000000000007,0

When João Nogueira, an associate of DECO, decided he wanted to invest in cryptocurrency, he went through all the steps required to connect his bank account to his exchange platform account, only to find out his bank was blocking him from making any cryptocurrency related transactions. After some back-and-forth where Nogueira insisted on clarification, it came to light that this was a matter of policy for the bank, despite not having any known legal basis to support its actions. The Portuguese central bank, Banco de Portugal, previously stated that they have issued no guidelines instructing banks to prevent money transfers to cryptocurrency exchange accounts. DECO has since reached out to six other Portuguese banks to ascertain whether they have any limitations set in place on this sort of transaction. Only one, Novo Banco, has so far answered, stating that they currently have no restrictions related to these operations. Earlier this month, Publico reported that the country will be charging no fees on crypto-related profits, as there is no framework in Portuguese law to consider them taxable.

Many regulations have come to light from countries that hold the majority of Bitcoin holders, such as China and South Korea. Other speculations have been centered around the unknown affect the Bitcoin futures contracts have on the market and the lastest, the effect that institutional investors have had when they flooded the market. China’s government has been active in its cryptocurrency regulations, as it recently surfaced that it will shut down mining operations due to power shortages. Many speculations have surfaced that it isn’t, in fact, the energy problem that shut down these operations but it was China’s central bank, due to rampant fraud and “money laundering” occurring within the country. As the country now focuses on attempting to cut off access to online platforms used to trade digital currencies, many of its residents are bound to find ways around these new regulations. It is a compelling speculation and one that most seem to be on board with but some are not necessarily convinced.   Source: CoinMarketCap   Futures As you can see from the chart above, Bitcoin has had higher than normal consistent volatility in its price since the first launch of its Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) futures, on December 10th. It reached a record high of over $20,000 a coin, just before the major Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures began and took an immediate bearish turn. It remains unclear by many analysts how these Bitcoin futures have affected the market, but there is no denying that they have in some way. Noelle Acheson, an author from CoinDesk, made an interesting statement before the first Bitcoin futures launched. She said: “But… it’s also possible that the institutional investors that are negative on bitcoin’s prospects (and there’s no shortage of those) may use the futures markets to put money behind their conviction. It’s much easier to sell a futures contract with a lower-than-market price than it is to actually short bitcoin. These investors may well send signals to the actual bitcoin market that sends prices tumbling.” On January 9th, there were a total of 1,907 short position contracts on the CBOE exchange and when these contracts closed, BTC was down 36 percent. Since the price of Bitcoin has since rebounded and is selling above the $12,500 mark. The largest exchange, CME, will have its futures contracts expire this coming Friday. Many will continue to monitor Bitcoin’s price, as Friday closes in. Confirmation of the effect of these futures can only be shown with time.   Institutional Investors Buy-In The most intriguing argument I’ve read to date comes from Georgy Verbitsky, managing director of Russia & CIS at EToro, claiming institutional experienced investors who entered the bitcoin market drove down the price. Verbitsky explains that many understand that the reason for Bitcoin’s price skyrocketing and the influx of the cash flow within the past few months, stemmed from mass-market and pensioners investing. He told RT:  “Experienced investors knew that the bitcoin honeymoon couldn’t last forever. Those who catch the last train are usually punished by the market. Big-time miners and institutional investors understood that they needed to diversify, that they had to get some fiat money.” Verbitsky isn’t convinced that China and South Korean are to blame for the price drop. “It was about pure greed. Of course, after they lost a third to a half of their investments, they pushed the ‘sell’ button,” he said. He goes on to make a compelling point backing his argument, with China’s ban on ICOs back in September. Verbitsky claims that was a much larger blow to bitcoin but the market remained bullish and the hit went completely unnoticed.    What Next?
Verbitsky makes a compelling speculation, one I have not heard yet. While the futures effects continue to be monitored and remain unknown, most shouldn’t worry. Any sort of investment is a gamble but you can say investing in cryptocurrency with its high volatility, is extremely risky. Most invested in Bitcoin are in it for the long haul. If you’ve invested more than you can afford and are extremely concerned, I’d say sell because the volatility isn’t going anywhere. The price of Bitcoin will continue to fluctuate but many trusted financial analysts believe that 2018, will be the year Bitcoin continues to rise. Featured Image: Snip",1243.0,1

The simple answer to that — of course — depends on one’s background, objectives, and wealth.  But an interesting proposition that’s been thrown around lately revolves around bitcoin becoming a topical investment that could even rival gold. Could bitcoin function in the same way as gold? Could it also be a store of value?  Coincidentally, both assets have roughly similar per-unit values at the moment. So now is a good time to ask these questions. To provide the answers, we must look at some of bitcoin’s key characteristics that make it attractive to investors. It is well documented that the bitcoin virtual currency has a limited supply — 21 million to be exact. Recently, reports came out informing the market that 80% of the world’s BTC has been mined, with approximately 4.2 million still remaining out there. In comparison, the supply of gold is said to increase by 1% to 2% annually.  Just by using the law of supply and demand, we can extrapolate that bitcoin’s value hinges largely on its demand. A perfectly inelastic supply — when all coins have been mined — signifies that any movement in bitcoin’s demand would directly affect its price without any part of the supply curve offsetting the demand-induced price movement. This is one plausible explanation (using market dynamics in economics) for bitcoin’s volatile; it is super sensitive to demand shifts. Because its supply is set at a certain amount, there is a good chance bitcoin will become increasingly valuable as demand continues to go up like it did for the past year. Remember, the global population is also growing, so the number of bitcoin consumers can only rise. Because it is a virtual currency, bitcoin is extremely convenient to buy and easy to carry around. This has both its pros and cons. On the bright side, every transaction involving bitcoin happens quickly, particularly those involving large sums of money, and its users can benefit from the anonymity of ownership, such that bitcoin can be used in all sorts of purchases. This makes bitcoin especially valuable in the black market. On the downside, because it’s virtual, bitcoin is more vulnerable to disruptions to its system (i.e. hacks), therefore potentially losing all its value. Moreover, bitcoin’s benefits can only be realized by a select group of people in the society — those who are tech-savvy. For the older generations, even the concept behind bitcoin eludes them, segregating them from the world of cryptocurrency. For the most part, bitcoin is considered a decentralized entity not subject to any government regulations. Again, this is both good and bad. While decentralization allows all members of the bitcoin community to engage in the mining and verification process, it does create problems that can only be mitigated by governing authorities. For example, without regulation, transactions in the black market, as well as money laundering using bitcoin, would be left uncontrolled. Remember the story in 2015 about the arrest of the owner of the Silk Road website and how bitcoin was involved in that ordeal? This is why some jurisdictions are pushing for cryptocurrency laws to tackle these issues. Indeed, bitcoin offers our society another choice of currency that’s both secure and easy to use with the potential to appreciate, but does that make it a good store of value compared to gold? For this, we must consider how their values would look years down the road.  Source: coindesk.com Looking at their historical prices, there’s a telling story: Bitcoin has a much higher variation over the past three years than gold, but overall it is trending upwards, while gold stayed relatively flat. This says a lot about the risks involved with these assets. Obviously, Bitcoin has a higher risk, though its value could keep going up especially as it is even rarer than gold. Also, the problem some have with bitcoin isn’t about its volatility, but how the volatility would hinder its path towards becoming real money. On the other hand, gold can be considered a relatively safer investment, especially as it has been around for thousands of years — nothing is going to hurt its status as the #1 precious metal. As an investor, you want to know your investment horizon when making a judgment. As seen over the past few months, bitcoin does fluctuate. Hence, those investing in the short term would have a higher chance of profiting from bitcoin. “For more than 5,000 years gold and silver have been tried-and-true money. They’ve lasted basically the duration of organized civilization,” said Dave Kranzler of Investment Research Dynamics. In the long run, both assets would likely go up but for different reasons. For bitcoin, its limited supply and the rising popularity of digital currency right now would certainly boost its value. As for gold, investors would always view it as a good hedge against inflation and the stock market, which was traditionally its most common use. Former PayPal president David Marcus once gave his own view on bitcoin: “I really like bitcoin. I own bitcoins. It’s a store of value, a distributed ledger. It’s a great place to put assets, especially in places like Argentina with 40% inflation, where $1 today is worth 60 cents in a year, and a government’s currency does not hold value. It’s also a good investment vehicle if you have an appetite for risk. But it won’t be a currency until volatility slows down.” The security breaches in the virtual world could be seen as the biggest fear factor for those buying bitcoin. No one can change the fact that bitcoin is a man-made entity, and anything created by humans has its own implicit uncertainties. Some also argue that bitcoin is “easy to get in but hard to get out”. In addition, interference by regulatory authorities has always caused fears in the cryptocurrency space. A government crackdown could hit bitcoin’s value depending on the nature and magnitude of change imposed. If one’s looking for a safe and reliable investment, gold would easily be one of the ideal candidates. The only major problem investors have is that it is not as transferable as fiat money, and certainly much more difficult when compared to bitcoin. Imagine you need to make a deal involving tens of kilograms of gold, someone would need to transfer that. Plus, there’s a possibility that it could get stolen on its way. So the speed in which gold can be used as a medium of exchange is not optimal in many cases. Whatever what your investment goals are, both bitcoin and gold are assets that have value in the future. In fact, as mentioned, gold can be a hedge against many things, and cryptocurrency may be one of those. This week, the market saw an influx of money pouring into gold purchases, with 30,000 kilograms sold on January 17, due to the cryptocurrency market (including bitcoin) being down for consecutive days.  Source: Bloomberg Therefore, one way to regard the “bitcoin vs. gold” argument is to see them as complements that diversify one’s portfolio.  On one hand, investing solely in bitcoin presents a “high-risk, high-reward” scenario, while putting all eggs in the gold basket is much safer but has a lower growth ceiling. This is tantamount to choosing between equity in a rising sector and bonds. In the end, the investment decision and allocation really depend on how aggressive an investor wants to be.

But it is hard to maintain a steady outlook on the digital currency due to the fact that the price is starting to fluctuate almost at a daily rate.  It’s for these reasons that people are calling bitcoin a speculative bubble. The latest to join in on the conversation is Robert Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale University, located in New Haven, Connecticut.  In the past, Shiller has been fairly vocal on where he stands when it comes to bitcoin. In fact, several months ago, the Nobel Laureate stated that the digital currency “has no value at all unless there is some common consensus that it has value.”  Further, he also stated in September of last year that bitcoin is the “best example of a bubble.”  That being said, it seems Shiller is neither for bitcoin now nor is he against it – he seems genuinely at a loss for words when it comes to the currency. Yesterday, Shiller said in an interview with CNBC that he “doesn’t know what to make of Bitcoin ultimately.”  Shiller might be confused, and he might still believe that the currency will one day implode, like many other well-known figures believe, but he did say that whether bitcoin collapses and is forgotten, he suspects that the cryptocurrency “could linger on for a good long time,” adding that the collapse could be here “in 100 years.”  Can you imagine another 100 years of this? Another 100 years of constantly waking up to see whether or not the price of bitcoin has dropped – like it has been as of late – or if it soared.  I don’t know about you, but I’m not sure I could take another 100 years of that. Featured Image: Facebook",177.60000000000036,1

In fact, they believe in generating value from these movements. The movement of Cryptocurrencies remains soft in Friday trade after the dramatic last few sessions. Bitcoin pared previous losses, but the currency struggles to break the physiological mark of $12,000. Bitcoin was trading around $11,587.30, down 2.5% over the previous day. There were a lot of optimistic and downbeat news’ surrounding the market in Friday trade; traders are eagerly waiting for the final announcement from South Korea. Morgan Stanley’s (NYSE:MS) move of clearing the Bitcoin futures has raised trader’s sentiments, as this move will permit institutional investors to take part in the cryptocurrency trading. After the move, Morgan Stanley joined Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in legitimizing bitcoin futures. However, Morgan Stanley’s management hasn’t yet completely explained their plan whether they are going to take custodial responsibilities or market making. Analysts have a mixed opinion over the Morgan Stanley’s move. Although clearing bitcoin futures would be a low-risk action, but bitcoin’s volatile nature of making huge swings in a single trading session combined with its unregulated status could craft noteworthy systemic risks for the institutions involved. On the other hand, Bitcoin traders are waiting for the news from South Korea to make their future trading strategies. South Korea is the third largest cryptocurrency market. Thus, any new from Korean markets could lead big movements in prices as we have seen in the last two weeks. The renewed concerns amid the potential ban have wiped off almost $200 billion from the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrencies on Wednesday. Bitcoin has hit $9,402.29 on Wednesday, the lowest level since last November. “It’s impossible to ban Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading because the more you regulate, the more it will become popular,” declared Francesco Nazari Fusetti, CEO of Aidcoin and CharityStars. Regulating bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies appear to be a priority for several countries, due to the threat of money laundering, particularly in South Asian emerging markets. Indonesia, which is among the fastest growing south-east Asian country, has recently warned their citizens from cryptocurrency trading. Featured Image: twitter",177.60000000000036,1
2018-01-19,11429.8,11992.8,11172.1,11607.4,10740400128.0,195158837709.0," Following the famous all-time high of Bitcoin on December 15th, 2017, even the last few people who had been living under various rocks have finally heard about cryptocurrency. Many have decided they wanted in. It seems like the perfect way to get rich – almost zero work included, just buy at the dip and sell at the peak. Why didn't I think of that? I've known all about crypto for ages now! Because as they say, hindsight is 20/20, and while it may not be too late to start investing, you’re afraid that the bubble will still burst. Regardless of whether you're a seasoned veteran or a noob in crypto, you must be wondering what causes its market fluctuations. Short answer: if we knew for sure, we'd all be rich. I wouldn't be writing this article because I'd be busy hiding this sort of knowledge from the public, faking my own death and moving to the Azores. The long answer is in this article. The terms value and price may be used interchangeably here, both denoting the exchange rate of cryptocurrency in relation to another (generally fiat) currency. Governments
While the selling point of cryptocurrency is decentralization, it would be wrong to assume that governments have nothing to do with crypto price. Every time the (generally Orwellian) restrictions on the use of crypto are imposed in a country, prices change drastically within – the effect on prices in the world depends on which country we are talking about. While we, most likely, wouldn't feel the difference of a tiny country opting out of the game, the prices for locals would skyrocket. On the other hand, China banning Bitcoin has backfired on them, with the prices rising significantly within only a few days.  Security Breaches
Obvious though it is, security is a huge factor. When Bitcoin Gold was reported to be compromised in November, 2017, they were lucky to find that their prices had fallen by less than 7%. However, Bitcoin hadn't fared that well in 2014, after the discovery of the Heartbleed bug: prices fell 10% within the next month, and the world held its breath even when the breach was reported fixed. Paradoxically, though, crypto often bounces back or even rises instead of falling at all; with such expensive feedback, security is often improved in a surprisingly short time and leaks are patched – unless the currency has died for good. More is sometimes less
If you are among the select few lucky enough to have, for example, Bitcoin holdings above around USD 10 million,  it may prove challenging to exchange your BTC to a fiat currency without disrupting the market. This is caused by the fact that Bitcoin has not spread enough on the mass market yet – a fact that is likely to be amended soon enough. To a certain extent, this contributes to Bitcoin volatility, and is applicable to other cryptocurrencies as well. Although small, this factor shows the need for the mass market adoption of cryptocurrency through a new lens.  Public Perception
During and after the Mt. Gox, a crypto exchange, fiasco in 2014, prices plummeted in general, not to mention the crash on Mt. Gox itself – hardly unexpected, because who wants to be fooled like that? This goes both ways: Ripple increased in price 37,000% by the end of 2017, thanks to the interest of big-name banks and payment processing services – its target audience. Privacy and security also remained a concern in the eyes of the public, thanks to which in 2017, Monero saw a 2,531% value increase. For a decentralized currency that strives to be from the people to the people, the scrutiny of its audience is bound to be a major, possibly even the largest, factor in its market price. Panic Selling
We have all been there – you see prices increasing, everyone is talking about cryptocurrencies, and you think to yourself, “I really want to be part of this!” Sure, many of us stopped there (because we were scared of losing money), but luckily not all. Many more bought their preferred currency and waited for it to skyrocket. It happened to others, right? But we want quick profits! As soon as the price starts falling, we panic, thinking we won’t be able to break even at the very least, and sell it all. Now we’re comically wiping our brows and thinking we just barely made it out – until next week, the prices rise again...
Still, this sort of dumping can and will drop the prices even further very quickly. A number of cryptocurrencies has died this way, because they can’t make the laborious rise again. And while this is a known factor, not everyone agrees it’s as big as it seems to be. Market Manipulation
Luke Martin, blockchain startup investor and advisor, considers the forces behind the market fluctuations more sinister than most. „What if its [sic] not 'noobs' dumping alts, but its [sic] that speculators/MMs are moving their bids lower? Less liquidity from buyers. That would shift down the price of alts too... The market may be smarter than you think“, reads a recent tweet. And sure, if I refuse to pay the price you’re asking for, and the next person does the same, with enough encouragement, you will be forced to lower the price if you still want to sell.
Another noteworthy market manipulation tactic is ""pump and dump"", a decades-old scheme (made popular by the Wolf of Wall Street where a group of individuals (or, increasingly often, bots work together to buy a relatively unknown cryptocurrency simultaneously, causing the price to inflate through demand – and sell it off to eager investors, who are fooled by the rising price. The aforementioned individuals make off with the money, while the investors are left wondering where the other interested parties are. (Hint: there never were any).
___________ Conclusion With this breakneck pace of changes, improvements and reactions concerning cryptocurrency, its price will remain volatile at least over the next few years. Singling out the reasons for its fluctuations helps us understand them better, even though no combination of them is a fool-proof cheat-sheet for getting rich on crypto investments. In this regard, cryptocurrency is no different than any other investment that may rise or fall beyond belief in as short a time as 24 hours. The only safe way to hold on to your money is to remain behind the stage and watch without participating. But where’s the fun in that?",177.60000000000036,1

Benjamin Quinlan, CEO and Managing Partner of his own consultancy, Quinlan & Associates, and formerly a leading strategist for Deutsche Bank, said that the recent fall in the price of Bitcoin is more than just a temporary blip, and indeed the Hong Kong-based banker believes that the cryptocurrency's valuation will be closer to USD 800 by 2020. ""It's a very emotional topic, where Bitcoin is and where it's going to go,"" explained Quinlan, talking to Bloomberg. The rapid fall in the valuation of Bitcoin in recent days has shaken many investors, and raised questions about its durability. ""The most recent example, with the price swings in Bitcoin, reinforce the fact that its core purpose as a medium of exchange or a currency is potentially threatened by the fact that its price volatility is just so extreme."" ""You add in additional things like transaction times are relatively slow, transaction charges, though it's technically meant to be free, are quite high, and it really thwarts the case that it's meant to be a potential currency."" Quinlan was more positive about the future for newer cryptocurrencies, with what he views as a greater inherent versatility than Bitcoin. ""Cryptocurrencies with potential applications, and utilities, such as Ethereum - smart contracts can be built on top of it, decentralized applications - Bitcoin in its current form can't do that. Other cryptocurrencies have anonymity functions and privacy that far surpasses the level of Bitcoin, and some have transaction processing times that far surpass Bitcoin."" Quinlan, who enjoys a successful parallel career in Kong Kong as a stand-up comedian, drew parallels with the early days of social media. ""There are various social media players - there are players that started out initially when the various social media platforms came about, but due to the fact that they were not technologically as advanced as competitors that came in, they really fell out of favor with investors."" Many will remember MySpace, and how it was superseded by Facebook, and that may be a change that we are about to see in the world of cryptocurrencies.",177.60000000000036,1

Considering it took both this year and last year by storm, it would be hard not to form an opinion on the virtual currency, whether you are interested in it or not.  But it’s not just enough for the general public to speak out about their opinions on Bitcoin, because, let’s face it, we only really listen to credible and authoritative sources.  Therefore, today we are going to look at what some of the most well-known Bitcoin bulls and bears are saying about the cryptocurrency.  Before we begin, let’s do a little recap on where the digital currency is sitting as of right now and how it has been performing over the course of the past couple of weeks.  After dropping below the $10,000 mark on Tuesday, and then plunging as low as $9,199.59 in early trade yesterday, Bitcoin has now moved back to the $12,000 mark today, which indicates a growth of more than 20% when compared to the previous close.  Taking into consideration the past couple of weeks, today’s move is pretty significant, and I’m sure anyone who is pro-bitcoin is reasonably happy, but I can’t help but wonder if the price of bitcoin will ever move past $19,000 like it did on December 10 of last year.  As mentioned, we like to listen to credible sources when it comes to our financial decisions. The problem when it comes to bitcoin is that it seems that these sources are divided into two parties: those who are for bitcoin, and those who are against it.  For this article, we are going to be looking at what each party has been saying as of late.  First, we have Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat, who just opened up in an interview with CNBC on Thursday in which he stated that he forecasts that bitcoin will hit $25,000 by the end of this year.  This is pretty significant considering Lee had initially forecasted that the currency wouldn’t reach this market until the year 2020.  Another credible source that has spoken publicly about bitcoin is Peter Thiel, entrepreneur and investor, who stated back in November that anyone who is criticizing bitcoin is “underestimating it,” adding that bitcoin is a “reserve form of money,” comparing it to gold and stating that “it’s just store of value” and individuals don’t “need to use it to make payments.”  Last but not least, we have James Gorman, CEO of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), who stated last year that the digital currency is “something more than just a fad,” adding that the entire concept of “anonymous currency is very interesting.”  As mentioned, there are plenty of people hoping – and perhaps praying – for bitcoin to fail. Here are three public figures who have spoken out about bitcoin in a negative tone:  Saudi Arabian billionaire Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal stated in November, “I just don’t believe in this bitcoin thing.” A criticism in its simplest form.  The Prince went on to say that he believes the currency will “implode one day,” and that it doesn’t make sense to him that “this thing is not under control” and “not under the supervision” of a central bank.  Second, former chairman Ben Bernanke stated in November of last year that he doesn’t believe bitcoin will end up being a success because it is a clear “attempt to replace fiat currency and evade regulation and government intervention.” Last but not least, we have Joseph Stiglitz, who is a Nobel Prize-winning professor of economics, and someone I personally look up too.  Stiglitz announced last month that bitcoin should be “outlawed,” stating that it “doesn’t serve any socially useful function.”  Personally, I find it difficult to choose a side when it comes to bitcoin. Some days I think this digital currency is going to continue to climb, and other days I believe that it is just a speculative bubble. At least I’m not alone, however. It seems that most of the world, including our financial leaders, are experiencing the same confliction. What do you think? Yay or nay for bitcoin?  Featured Image: Twitter ",276.10000000000036,1

Bitcoin moved back to the $12,000 mark in Thursday’s trade, signifying a growth of more than 20% compared to the previous close. Bitcoin hit as low as $9,199.59 in early trade on Wednesday. The price pared losses in the evening session and bounced back to the level of $11,188.84 at the end of the day.  Source: CoinMarketCap Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile in nature, evident from the latest sideways movement. Due to the volatile nature, governments all around the world are planning to make strict regulatory requirements for bitcoin and other digital currencies. After a long controversy, there is depressing news’ coming out of South Korea today. In a national policy committee meeting on Thursday, Choi Jong-ku, who is the head of South Korea’s Financial Services Commission said, “The government is considering both shutting down all local virtual currency exchanges or just the ones who have been violating the law.” Along with China, South Korea is leading other global players over crypto regulation, as several countries have already shown their strong concerns over the money laundering with the help of cryptocurrencies.        Answering to reporter’s question, Lee Ju-yeol said, “cryptocurrency is not a legal currency and is not being used as such as of now.”    China is also one of the countries that are making strict regulations for the virtual currency trading. The country is now looking to completely ban any type of centralized trading of digital currencies. South Korea has yet to make clear their stance on cryptocurrency trading. However, Bitcoin and the other digital currencies are moving higher in Thursday trade. There are some analysts who believe in the strength of cryptocurrencies and they see regulations as a favorable step for digital currencies in the long run. “These large drops, usually between the 25-40 percent range, generally find a bottom that is a consolidation of a previous-time high. When this bottom is found, the pattern continues with demand causing a new upward bounce,” said Nolan Bauerle, director of research at CoinDesk. Overall, the short-term future of the cryptocurrency is highly correlated to the final decision of South Korea.   Featured Image: twitter",276.10000000000036,1

The managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, who once said last year that Bitcoin could reach as high as $25,000 in five years, reiterated his bullish stance on the cryptocurrency in a publication today, stating that even though it plunged by 34% in just two days, Bitcoin’s recent price action can be seen as “normal”. Explaining his rationale, Lee evidenced that the market had seen similar fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price for the past two years. He also pointed out that since mid-2016, there have been six rallies of more than 75% and six sell-offs exceeding 25%.  Source: Business Insider According to Lee: “What happens in years in equity markets is months in the crypto world.” Bitcoin’s price action since mid-2016 (as shown above) has shown that it is able to recover from the kind of drops we’ve seen for the past few days. This chart also resembles those of various tech stocks that have had tremendous growths over the past decade, but as Lee pointed out, any significant movement for Bitcoin happens in much shorter intervals compared to stocks. Based on this, Lee sees now as a great opportunity to “buy the dip” because he believes Bitcoin would eventually reverse back to its previous highs and test new resistance levels. “We think the best way to think about sell-offs is to look at it through the lens of retracements — how much of the prior rise is given back,” Lee wrote. “We view this $9,000 as the biggest buying opportunity in 2018 — and we would be buyers at levels around here.” Coincidentally, Lee’s “prophecy” has come to fruition to some extent, as Bitcoin rallied by approximately 20% as of Thursday morning. But like we’ve noticed with cryptocurrency, this could change at any moment. Beyond Bitcoin, Lee also added that he is extremely bullish on cryptocurrency in general, forecasting that this market could exceed $1.2 trillion. Featured Image: twitter",276.10000000000036,1
2018-01-18,11198.8,12107.3,10942.5,11474.9,15020399616.0,192907550324.0," On December 10, 2017, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), one of the leading derivatives exchanges in the US officially launched the trading of bitcoin futures contracts. A week later, on December 17, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange followed suit and also launched bitcoin futures on its exchange after the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approved the new financial product.  The announcement of bitcoin futures coming to two leading U.S. derivative exchanges sparked bitcoin’s incredible year-end rally that saw the price of bitcoin hit its 2017 high of USD 20,000 in mid-December, driven by the potential new investor funds that can now flow into bitcoin as both institutional investors and private investors are now able to bet on the price of bitcoin through a regulated investment vehicle.   What are Bitcoin Futures Contracts? Futures contracts, also referred to as futures, are standardized exchange-traded financial derivatives that provide an agreement between a buyer and a seller to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a predefined date. 
Each futures contract represents a specific amount of the underlying asset and futures can be either cash settled or come with physical delivery. In the case of bitcoin futures, the underlying asset is the digital currency bitcoin.  How Do You Trade Bitcoin Futures? To trade bitcoin futures on the CME or the CBOE as a private investor, you need an account with a brokerage that offers bitcoin futures trading. As for January of 2018, Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade, and Ally Financial offer this to their clients but more brokerages are expected to follow suit. Once you are registered with a broker that allows you to trade bitcoin futures you can buy them online in the same fashion that you would buy futures on commodities like gold, silver or oil. If you believe that the price of bitcoin will hit USD 20,000 by mid-February, you could purchase a CBOE Feb 17 XBT futures contract at USD 15,000. If by February 14, 2018, when the contract expires, the price is at USD 20,000, you will have made a profit of USD 5,000. This profit could be higher depending on the leverage that your broker can provide you with. Of course, you can also close out your trade ahead of the expiry date if you want to take profit earlier. However, if during the time of the contract the value drops, your broker will ask you to top up your margin account to ensure you can cover potential losses from the trade. If you fail to top up your maintenance margin account when you receive a margin call, your trade will be closed out for you by your broker.  Due to the added leverage that futures bring, they are considered a much riskier investment than stocks and bonds.  However, futures can also be used to hedge investment risk by entering into a short position. This was actually the original idea of commodity futures when they were introduced for farmers to hedge their market risk. For example, if a farmer knows he will raise 10,000 bushels of corn, he can short sell one futures contract for corn (assuming one contract covers 10,000 bushels of corn) at a specific price with the expiry set to the time when he plans on selling his corn. If the price of corn should drop before the farmer can sell his corn, this loss is offset by the gains on the short futures contract. In effect, commodity futures allow producers to lock in the price at which they want to sell their product.  CME vs CBOE Bitcoin Futures Futures are standardized exchange-traded financial products. However, futures contract do differ from exchange to exchange. That means you can only trade CME bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and CBOE bitcoin futures only on the CBOE.  While the two bitcoin futures contracts trade in the same way from a technical point of view, they have the following key differences:  CME bitcoin futures have the ticker ‘BTC’, have a contract unit of five bitcoins and 35% initial margin is needed to place a trade. CBOE bitcoin futures, on the other hand, have the ticker ‘XBT’, their contract unit is one bitcoin, and the margin requirement is 44%.  Both futures contracts are in US dollar and are cash settled, which means no bitcoin are exchanged at the end of the contract - only the cash difference. Also, both contracts have the three closest months listed as contract expiry dates.  If you are entirely new to futures trading, you can start out practicing using the CME’s bitcoin futures trading simulator before you place your first trade with your broker.  Bitcoin Futures - The Early Days When bitcoin futures started to trade on the CBOE on December 10, 2017, the price rallied as investors were confident that the opening up of bitcoin to institutional investors in this format would bring new money into the asset class. On the exchange itself, however, trading volumes of bitcoin futures remained comparatively low and was reportedly largely dominated by retail investors[/URL] as institutional market participants were concerned about the clearing of these new futures.  Less than USD 10 million worth of bitcoin futures were traded on the CBOE in the first hour of trading while at the same time, the popular bitcoin exchange Bitfinex traded around USD 170 million worth of bitcoin.  Bitcoin futures trading volumes have remained comparatively low at both the CME and the CBOE. At both exchanges, the January expiry contract is the most popular and is experiencing the most trading volume while February and March contracts are seeing very little trading action.  Judging by the current rate, it looks like it will take a few more months before bitcoin futures will take up a larger share of trading at the CME and CBOE. This is most likely the case as the majority of large investment houses are still assessing the risks of gaining exposure to a decentralized digital currency such as bitcoin.",276.10000000000036,1

He said he didn’t see Bitcoin as a “payment system player”. ""My take is that Bitcoin is much more today a commodity that somebody could invest in; and honestly, somewhat of a speculative commodity,"" said Kelly. This goes hand-in-hand with the recent veto on cryptocurrency cards; earlier this month, Visa subsidiary Wavecrest withdrew its service seemingly overnight, leaving crypto card issuers struggling to find alternative solutions. And while Visa remains tight-lipped about the reasons for the veto, offering only that it was due to “continued non-compliance with our operating rules”, Wirex CEO Pavel Matveev told Bitcoin News that, “Wavecrest have been violating Visa rules for months…it’s 100% Wavecrest’s fault and they knew it was coming a couple of months ago.” Back in 2015, Fortune published an article about the stance of Visa and MasterCard towards Bitcoin, especially noting their seeming reluctance to throw in with cryptocurrency, instead expressing their interest in the underlying blockchain technology. The CEO’s current stance on Bitcoin only serves to support this existing speculation. In light of this latest unequivocal rejection of cryptocurrency, any companies intent on bridging the gap between crypto and fiat currency will have to look for other ways, knowing that no support will be forthcoming from either Visa or any of its subsidiaries.",276.10000000000036,1

Cryptocurrencies fell dramatically during early trading on Wednesday, wiping off almost $2 billion from the total market capitalization. At the top of the selloff, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization plunged to $450 billion, sharply lower from an all-time high of above $800 billion. In early Wednesday trading, bitcoin dipped below $10,000 for the first time since early December.  However, bitcoin pared some of the early losses in the evening session, currently trading close to $11,000, lower only 2% from its previous day price. Its price hit the highest level of $20,000 mark on December 17. Discussing the longevity of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Dick Kovacevich, the chairman of Wells Fargo told CNBC: “I think it’s a pyramid scheme. It makes no sense. I’m just surprised it isn’t even lower. I never called it a fraud because there’s no fraudulent thing going on… the fundamentals make no sense.” During Wednesday trading, ethereum price also declined below $800 for the first time since the start of this year. Ethereum was among the best performing virtual currencies since the start of this year, amid its wide acceptance and unique features compared to bitcoin and ripple. The concerns related to the potential ban on cryptocurrency trading in South Korea have jolted its price in the last two sessions. After an early selloff in Wednesday trading, ethereum price recovered the majority of what it had lost. The digital currency is currently trading around $984, down only 1% from the previous close. Traders’ concerns related to strong regulatory requirements have burst cryptocurrency prices in the last two trading sessions. China has already taken strict actions against cryptocurrency trading, while South Korea is preparing a bill to impose tough regulatory requirements. The option of completely banning the cryptocurrency trading is still open, the South Korean minister said in an interview. Although prices recovered late in Wednesday trading, analysts have a bearish outlook for digital currencies.      Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Violka08",-242.5,0

The broader selloff was observed in cryptocurrency markets in the last two days, amid concerns over regulators.  Bitcoin lost more than half of its value since hitting the highest level of $20,000 on December 17.  Currently trading around $10,010, bitcoin lost more than 30% of value in the last two days alone.  Other major cryptocurrencies, including ripple (xrp), ethereum (eth), and bitcoin cash (bch) dived at a high double-digit rate in the last two days. Bitconnect was the worst performer, losing more than 95% of price since the start of this week, due to the announcement that it is closing its exchange indefinitely. Digital currency traders all over the world are shorting their positions, while others are sitting tight on the side to see the impact of regulatory uncertainty on prices. The price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies started falling last Wednesday after South Korean minister hinted the potential ban on cryptocurrency trading. Digital currencies have experienced a big blow this week on Tuesday when South Korean minister re-established their tough stance on cryptocurrency trading. In addition, South Korea has already banned creating anonymous cryptocurrency trading accounts. “South Korea will make a decision on a proposed ban on cryptocurrency exchanges after sufficient consultation and coordination of opinions,” the South Korean Minister said on Monday. Although global markets are accelerating on how to regulate cryptocurrencies, China has officially banned every kind cryptocurrency trading. They have also blocked trader’s access to offshore trading platforms that offer cryptocurrency trading. “There is a lot of panic in the market. People are selling to try and get the hell out of there,” said Charles Hayter, founder of Cryptocompare, which owns cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, France, Germany, and Indonesia are planning crackdowns on cryptocurrencies trading in the following days. Governments all over the world fear that crypto markets are turning out to be a haven for money launderers and terrorists. On the whole, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are tumbling on the fears of government’s crackdown along with a wave of selling. Analysts and fund managers are suggesting traders adopt the wait and the see strategy.   Featured Image: twitter",-242.5,0

This all started with a fan asking him on the social media platform when fans of the National Basketball Association would be able to purchase tickets with Bitcoin. However, the Dallas Mavericks won’t be the first NBA team to accept cryptocurrency as a means of payment for tickets. The Sacramento Kings started accepting Bitcoin back in 2014 for promotional products as well as ticket sales. In an interview with Coinbase, Cuban confirmed that they are currently looking into accepting other cryptocurrencies with their new crypto payment ability. Cuban said: “We will also look at accepting tokens from companies we have traditional business relationships with as a way to expand our customer base.” The ABC “Shark Tank” investor is a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space. Back in June of last year, he called Bitcoin a “bubble”, but within months was on the crypto train. Cuban has now invested in a digital currency hedge fund and an ICO (which raised $31 million) and, in August 2017, also launched the Ethereum-based cryptocurrency Mercury Protocol. In October, he was cited as calling cryptocurrencies and blockchain the “future”. In a video named “How To Get Rich” he gave a tip that you should invest 10% of your life savings into Bitcoin and Ethereum. As the entire cryptocurrency market seems to be going through a rough patch these last two weeks, the fact that big-time tech investors such as Mark Cuban and Zuckerberg see prospects of digital currency gives a glimmer of hope. With any market, corrections will occur as well as technical issues, but investors that have been in the game long don’t seem too concerned. Featured Image: dallasnews",-2345.6000000000004,0

Following up on a 2017 nationwide ban on cryptocurrency-to-fiat exchanges and initial coin offerings (ICOs) , a senior Chinese banking official is now supporting the prohibition of additional services related to and involved with crypto-trading, Reuters reported, citing a memo outlining a government meeting in early January.  Vice Governor Pan Gongsheng of China’s central bank, The People's Bank of China (PBOC), said the government would implement additional regulations to shut down branches of the cryptocurrency industry including settlement providers, market-makers, guarantors, peer-to-peer lending vehicles, alternative trading platforms and cryptocurrency wallets, according to the report.  Moreover, Pan suggested local governments heighten their monitoring of mining energy consumption and use electricity price, taxes, and land use and environmental regulations as tools to guide the mines “toward an orderly exit.” China is currently a world leader in cryptocurrency mining because of its low energy prices. In late 2017, Pan famously predicted the death of Bitcoin, saying, “There is only one thing left to do: Sit by the river bank and see Bitcoin’s body pass by one day.” Since the recent crackdown on the crypto-sphere, major Chinese exchanges such as OKEx and Huobi Pro have redirected their business development into over-the-counter (OTC) trading, which typically uses private dealers rather than centralized exchanges, as well as overseas crypto-to-crypto venues. Pan feels websites and apps that facilitate these practices and/or help people move money overseas should be sanctioned.

China has today announced the banning of centralised trading of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies amid an ongoing crackdown, targeting websites and apps that offer trading services. This follows earlier steps such as the banning of ICOs – a form of fundraising whereby new cryptocurrency startups sell their coins – and plans to implement power usage restrictions to mining operations. Since it is now illegal for Chinese residents to engage in any centralized cryptocurrency trading, the only option they have are private over-the-counter exchanges. Meanwhile in South Korea, cryptocurrency traders and investors may face fines if they do not attach their identity to currently anonymous virtual trading accounts, according to a Yonhap news report. This deals a low blow for enthusiasts, many of whom see anonymous finances as a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency ideology. Other preventative measures include: So why are these two countries so determined to tackle cryptocurrencies compared to the countries in the West, where residents and institutions have pretty much free reign to use and trade as much as they like? China is set on ensuring as much money stays within the country as possible. Digital currencies not only provide a channel for money to exit China, but one that is almost completely anonymous and very hard for an external observer to keep track of. Couple this financial control with harsh digital regulation (including, but not limited to, their extreme internet censorship), and it’s not entirely surprising. Ironically, China is not inherently anti-cryptocurrency, having developed coins of their own in the past. Similar to South Korea, they just want to control it.  South Korea’s tightening control is more startling. Crypto trading there is arguably more frenzied than anywhere else in the world. The extent of this is such that prices here often are higher than elsewhere. Though the measures are certainly less rigorous than in China, investors will be feeling the heat as the government mulls over even tighter restrictions.  So what does all this mean for crypto values worldwide? Certainly, knee-jerk reactions to the news caused a slump last week as Bitcoin fell 14% in response to South Korean regulations on January 11th. But the real effect may be more apparent in the long-term, as mining crackdowns begin to squeeze the supply of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. It’s worth considering the deflation effect that this may have.  Featured Image: twitter",52.5,1

Bitcoin lost considerable value last week, amid uncertainties related to the Chinese and South Korean governments. However, Bitcoin price jumped more than 6% in Monday’s trading, repairing some of the losses it generated last week.  Source Image: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin was standing around $17,468.90 on January 6. However, by January 13, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was selling for $14,237.70, marking a significant loss in price value. Although uncertainty regarding the regulatory authorities continues to impact investor sentiments this week, the majority of cryptocurrencies are still trading in the green today. Bank Indonesia has warned investors about trading in cryptocurrencies. The bank has taken a strict attitude against cryptocurrencies, urging investors to avoid buying, trading, or selling digital currencies. Early this month, Bank Indonesia also imposed a ban on all financial technology companies that were using cryptocurrencies for their transactions. They haven’t entirely banned cryptocurrency trading yet, but they have issued a new warning about it. On the other hand, the South Korean authorities have been silent over the threat of a potential ban since last Thursday. Last week, the South Korean justice minister announced that the government is preparing a bill to ban anonymous cryptocurrency trading. South Korea will make a decision on the proposed ban of anonymous cryptocurrency exchanges after “sufficient consultation and coordination of opinions” has occurred, said the country’s government on Monday. The broader rally was observed in crypto markets after the latest statement from South Korea Bitcoin price has soared above $14,259 in Monday trading after an early selloff.

The price of bitcoin declined more than $2,000 compared to a month ago level, up more than 1,600% over the same period last year.  Source: coinmarketcap.com Several factors added the big swings in bitcoin prices over the last two weeks. Initially, reports of strict regulations and higher taxes on bitcoin miners in China negatively impacted cryptocurrencies.  Moreover, concerns related to the potential ban on cryptocurrency trading from the South Korean government increased the volatility. Although the bitcoin history suggests big swings in a short-time, Warren Buffett expects a bad end for the cryptocurrencies. Investors and analysts seriously fear that the bitcoin bubble could burst anytime. Several major fund managers and renowned investors have been suggesting that investors avoid trading bitcoin, while the Securities Exchange & Commision has informed people to “exercise caution” and be wary of scammers. Buffett said the recent growth in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could have a bad end. On the other hand, John Rogers, the CEO at Ariel Investments, said the price of cryptocurrencies and bitcoin could decline sharply lower in the next five years.  Source: Wall Street Journal Bitcoin is a blockchain technology and it has only an online presence. Moreover, investors don’t have the authority to reverse transactions, making it an eye-catching option for cybercriminals. Several institutional investors are also taking short positions on bitcoin, signifying their bearish outlook. Overall, it appears that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are experiencing obstacles in wider adoption and their use in the real world. Goldman Sachs has also presented similar stance on bitcoin. Goldman Sachs says it is quite difficult for bitcoin to prosper as real money. The substantial volatility and swings in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies prices also suggest that it cannot work as money. Therefore, investors should remain cautious when trading bitcoin and other digital currencies.    Featured Image: twitter",526.7000000000007,1

Camilla Stephan-Heck and her husband have decided to accept the highly volatile cryptocurrency in exchange for their beautiful Vancouver Island home. Calculated in dollars, the couple is seeking $2.7 million CAD for their 5 bedroom oceanfront mansion. The dentist and lawyer bought their dream property back in 2001. They listed the home back in November but hadn’t started advertising on cryptocurrency websites until this month.  Mrs. Stephan-Heck said: “We dabble in cryptocurrency ourselves, we’re fairly diversified in our investments, bitcoin was gaining notoriety and we started doing some research. We’ve done reasonably well on it. It’s enough to have fun with.” The couple would accept either a full or partial Bitcoin payment but the real estate agent they’ve decided to use, expects the couple to be paid in CAD. The property is paid in full and the couple are currently waiting for the right offer. There are a dozen other Canadian homes listed for sale on the Bitcoin Real Estate website, including a farm and luxury condos. There is one buyer on the site that is looking for a home in Calgary and is willing to spend $450,000.  However, this isn’t new in the United States as many homes have already been sold in exchange for Bitcoin from Florida to Washington State. Many car dealerships have even begun accepting Bitcoin for luxury vehicles. Newport Beach California’s Lamborghini dealership has accepted payments in Bitcoin since late August of 2017.  It was inevitable that cryptocurrency would be adopted into goods, as many investors found it to be the most frustrating aspect of the digital currency. As returns continued to grow as the cryptocurrency market skyrockets at the last half of 2017, individuals grew frustrated that they were unable to spend their wealth on goods.. VISA and Mastercard have teamed up with projects and there are now cryptocurrency debit cards, that are accepted wherever these major card companies are accepted.

The fast-food chain is now accepting the cryptocurrency for a limited time for customers to buy a Bitcoin-themed chicken bucket called the “Bitcoin Bucket”. At the same time, KFC will also place a Facebook-based live tracker of the bucket’s price corresponding to the bitcoin-dollar exchange rate. To solve the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, the company has pegged the price of a Bitcoin Bucket at $20, which will be converted into fractions of a bitcoin when a purchase is made. In case you’re wondering how you can walk into a Canadian KFC location and purchase the Bitcoin Bucket, well, you can’t, at least physically. Instead, it is bought online using Bitpay as one of the payment options and the bucket will then be delivered to the customer’s address (though a $5 shipping fee will be charged). Currently, the Bitcoin Bucket is sold out (unfortunately). With this publicity stunt, KFC now joins a fast-growing list of companies to hop on the cryptocurrency bandwagon. The company’s social media team has been updating constantly on Twitter on the status of its mouthwatering Bitcoin Bucket.

However, all of that changed on Tuesday, January 9. On Tuesday, Jamie Dimon gave an interview with Fox Business in which he stated that even though he is still skeptical of Bitcoin, he regrets labeling it as a “fraud.”  For those who don’t know, Dimon has been CEO and President of JPMorgan since 2005.  Considering bitcoin was immensely popular throughout 2017, Dimon received a considerable amount of backlash after he made the “bitcoin is a fraud” comment back in September of 2017. Then, in October, just to spite those calling him out for his opinion, Dimon came forward and that he was not going to talk about the virtual currency anymore. That did not last long, however, as he was soon reported as saying that anyone who invests in bitcoin will eventually “pay the price.”  Now Dimon might come across as a little pessimistic when it comes to cryptocurrency, but he has been known for giving praise to blockchain technology, which is essentially the mastermind of bitcoin.  It seems Jamie Dimon is not the only person who feels this way; it seems anyone who is wary of bitcoin has no problem admitting that blockchain, on the other hand, is not a fraud. He told Fox Business on Tuesday that blockchain technology “is real.”  As we move further into 2018, it will be interesting to see if Dimon makes any more changes regarding his opinion on the cryptocurrency market.

The price of bitcoin has dropped sharply in the early trading session on Tuesday. However, its price gains some momentum in the afternoon session and currently trading just below the $15,000 mark. Although bitcoin declined in the last two trading session, it is still showing strong improvement compared to the level it has seen two weeks ago. Its price declined 4% in the last thirty days, but the price is up 1,545% in the last twelve months. Bitcoin has touched the highest level of $19,850 in mid-December but declined sharply in the next few days to the level of $12,000. Bitcoin has made big swings in the last couple of weeks on the back of mixed reports. The latest volatility in bitcoin prices was the result of strict policies from the Chinese government. According to Reuters and Bloomberg, China seeks to reduce electricity supply to bitcoin miners. China, which is a home for several miners, decided to impose hard regulations on bitcoin and other miners through, taxation, electricity pricing environmental regulations and property laws. Moreover, comments from JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts have also impacted bitcoin prices and traders sentiments. JPMorgan Chase CEO, Jamie Dimon, said bitcoin was a ‘fraud’. Furthermore, the decline in bitcoin’s price over the last two sessions was also supported by CoinMarketCap, which lists cryptocurrencies prices and valuations. The CoinMarketCap has removed data from South Korean exchanges, as the site has witnessed discrepancies from global prices at exchanges in South Korea. Several analysts and market pundits are showing their concerns over the sudden rise in bitcoin value and they expect this bubble to burst anytime in the days to come. On the other hand, the SEC has suggested investors to “exercise caution” and be wary of scammers.  Nevertheless, some investors have a positive view of the future fundamentals of bitcoin.

Back on Tuesday, the coin was selling at lows of $13,293.80 but seems to have grown $4,000 in just a matter of days, mimicking old habits.  Since Bitcoin’s decline, many altcoins have gained some serious momentum. Ripple (XRP) is now the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap and has just passed the $3.00 mark.

We’ve seen hacks that have lost people a lot of money, stock prices becoming inflated thanks to blockchain investments, fake digital currencies, and who could forget the huge plunge the original cryptocurrency took from near-$20,000 to below $13,000 at the end of December? Now, we bring you the next level – Egypt has banned Bitcoin. Bans on cryptocurrencies have happened before; a country deciding it’s against Bitcoin is nothing new. However, in this particular case, the Egyptian Grand Mufti who ordered the ban hasn’t just declared Bitcoin illegal for the country, he’s declared it as a direct transgression against Islam. According to the Egyptian Grand Mufti, as well as several other prominent Islamic leaders and their backers, Bitcoin is against the entire religion. This makes perfect sense once you listen to the reasoning behind this claim. Participating in the trading of cryptocurrencies is akin to gambling, which is strictly forbidden in Islam as it can directly cause the financial ruin of investors. Bitcoin, of all the cryptocurrencies, portrays this the best. It is extremely volatile, as is evidenced by the slide it experienced in December, and so it is certainly capable of causing a lot of financial ruin. People are saying that the preeminent coin is beginning to recover now (it is currently selling for $15,174.90, according to CoinMarketCap), but who is to say there won’t be another huge slide like the one witnessed at the end of 2017? A thing can only grow for so long. Egypt has declared Bitcoin a dangerous prospect and, frankly, this may not be the worst stance to get behind. Cryptocurrencies can be fun to play around with, much like gambling, but also like gambling, I think I’d prefer to watch from the sidelines. Featured Image: twitter",222.79999999999927,1

Those saying that Bitcoin, but also other cryptocurrencies, are a bubble come a dime a dozen.  Although crypto aficionados will vehemently deny the possibility of a bubble, it remains hard to know. There is, after all, only one way for cryptocurrencies to not pop: mass adoption. Luckily for the industry, most of our popular coins, led by Bitcoin and Ethereum, are already on the right path. Bitcoinsaltcoins.com points out the proof to this through four distinct trends. Steady traffic growth A total market cap of USD 150 billion in the case of Bitcoin and USD 69 billion for Ethereum vouch for this trend. Google Trends data also proves people’s interest in the young industry, given that everybody wants to learn more about it through googling. There was a significant correlation between search traffic and prices, although correlation does not always equal causation. In short, after a while, the network size of Bitcoin may become too big to fail - there will always be somebody interested in it, at least in terms of a speculative asset. This may not be the endgame for most early investors who would like to see Bitcoin grow into an accepted currency, but at least it is a guarantee against failure. Consumer-friendly applications Following the ever-increasing wave of initial coin offerings (ICOs), new features, mostly on the blockchain, are also trying to find a place in the industry. What’s possibly the best feature of ICOs and the projects they are representing is the fact that they are getting increasingly more user-friendly. Growth from developer-oriented apps and tokens towards people without as much understanding of even computer sciences, let alone anything else, may be the shift needed for mass adoption. Many of these projects are looking for ways to create an often decentralized environment (unless specified differently) for what they want to do. Some projects are looking for ways to bring more gender equality into this glaringly male-dominated field; others are simply creating a place for game developers to make games, eliminating the bias of centralized market places and fundraising platforms. Increased public awareness How many people do you know that haven’t heard the term Bitcoin? It has swiftly grown from a niche field to a household name. Although increased public awareness is not an exact, measurable metric, it can be intuitively observed - not very many people are going to look at you bewildered when you mention crypto. Educating people is also an important aspect of awareness, as this is a new frontier that everyone is naturally scared of. However, the rapid development of technology within the past few decades has already taught people to be more accepting of new things - for example, the internet wasn’t so bad after all, right? Educating people about blockchain and cryptocurrency is the only surefire way to have them look for possibilities rather than weaknesses in the industry. Industry-wide growth There is a term in the world of forecasting called “cone of uncertainty,” used by experts to determine a project’s chances of reaching a milestone based on previously accomplished milestones. Most of Bitcoin’s future milestones are based on continued growth, while Ether and other tokens will likely follow Bitcoin’s expansion pattern. This has already been proven to be the case: whenever Bitcoin rose, so did the others - and the same was true for the prices falling. These metrics are far from being conclusive, but are doing a good enough job of it. As the industry grows, it continues to establish the model for cryptocurrencies and indicates a greater likelihood of reaching the final milestone of mass adoption. Although the general consensus of cryptocurrencies being volatile still stands (as does the old, “don’t invest more than you can afford to lose”), the industry is moving into mass adoption territory quickly and with few hiccups - other than the general confusion regarding potential regulation. But as Jim Rohn, an American entrepreneur, author and motivational speaker, would put it, “If you are not willing to risk the usual, you will have to settle for the ordinary.”",222.79999999999927,1

Nobody knows for sure, but recent speculations have the number pinpointed to somewhere between 35 and 200 – a far cry from the two everyone thought back in December. The Winklevoss twins were the first publicly verified Bitcoin billionaires, holding around 91,666 Bitcoin, which at the time would have equaled about $1.063 billion. The keyword there, however, is “public”. We knew about the twins; they weren’t keeping their wealth a secret. But not everyone wishes to be a public figure, for any number of reasons (which will be discussed below), so the likelihood that the twins were the only Bitcoin billionaires was pretty slim. Why is it so difficult to figure out how many people hold a certain amount of Bitcoin? Well, for one, the very nature of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is to provide an anonymous source of currency. There are some who are exceptions to the rule, such as the Winklevoss twins, but there are many more people who fall into the rule, keeping their identities secret. Bitcoin makes it very easy to remain anonymous as well. Those that are smart will keep their funds in a digital wallet. Those that are really smart (and those that hold large fortunes of Bitcoin) will keep their funds in multiple wallets. We may be able to see how much is in this or that wallet, but we have no way of knowing if this or that wallet is owned by the same person or group – especially if those wallets don’t link to one another in a traditional way. Why would someone want to keep their Bitcoin ownership a secret? For one thing, hackers. If a hacker knew exactly who they needed to target, I would imagine it would be easier to target them. Those that were publicly out as Bitcoin billionaires would also be among the few cryptocurrency investors who would be hit hard with taxes and regulations that government agencies aren’t able to throw at Bitcoin due to the complexity and anonymity of the cryptocurrency world. That alone is certainly enough for someone to want to keep their billionaire status secret. In all likelihood, most of the Bitcoin billionaires, however many there are, are probably made up groups of people. exchanges or hedge funds. There are probably fewer individual billionaires as the rose-tinted glasses would like to have us believe. But any way you slice it, the Winklevoss twins are definitely not the only ones out there.

It started making some waves in the summer when it hovered in the $4,000 range. Then, in the early part of December, it almost hit $20,000, a phenomenal record that blew practically everyone away. Bitcoin made a lot of strides in 2017. Beyond just its amazing growth, the cryptocurrency hit a lot of milestones that would make any cyber mamma proud. Its growth also came with a growing acceptance into the mainstream – if you hadn’t heard of Bitcoin before 2017, you probably heard about it in 2017 – and Bitcoin also began to get integrated into everyday business, with payment platforms, companies, and even some financial giants taking up the cryptocurrency. It opened the door not just for itself but also for other digital currencies, some, that are seeing immense growths now, like Ripple. Blockchain, although somewhat more relatable to the cryptocurrency Ethereum, also grew in relation to Bitcoin. In the beginning of December, the preeminent coin saw not just one, but two launches for future trading contracts on the largest futures exchanges in the world, CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (NASDAQ:CBOE), which opened up the trading of cryptocurrency to a broader scope of investors on Wall Street. So where is it headed to now? The latter half of December actually saw a slight burst in the bubble that had investors everywhere panicking. The cryptocurrency dropped from its whopping near-$20,000 point to below $13,000 in a matter of only a few days, and it has yet to show very many signs of recovery. Currently, it is trading at $14,021, according to coinmarketcap.com (see chart below).  Source – coinmarketcap.com Bitcoin has started the new year with a decline, something which hasn’t happened since 2015 – a tough blow for some after all the highs in 2017. The top cryptocurrency is also losing its dominance of the market. According to coinmarketcap.com, Bitcoin’s dominance is now below the 40% mark, at 35.8%. What does this mean for Bitcoin? Is it the end of the cryptocurrency? In all likelihood, no. Many analysts, including the one who predicted 2017 climb, believe that Bitcoin is going to bounce back. It may not continue to grow at the immense rate of 2017, but it also seems doubtful that 2018 is going to bring a complete downfall of Bitcoin either. The coin still holds the largest market cap of all the digital currencies, with more than a $100 billion gain over the second highest cryptocurrency market cap, Ripple. It may be a rollercoaster of a ride, but Bitcoin is still going to be making headlines this year. Featured Image: twitter",1357.1000000000004,1

But, if you had to take a wild guess, what topic would you think was the most searched for on Google? President Donald Trump? North Korea and its nuclear program? Facebook and fake news? Or, would you guess that people spent a good amount of the year searching for news about digital currency Bitcoin? If you guessed the latter, you’re right. Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) just recently posted a series of data which details what the top searches in 2017 were. Bitcoin took second place in the “Global News” sector.  Since Bitcoin took the market by storm this year, it isn’t entirely surprising to hear that the currency made it on a list that looks at the top searches in 2017, but what is surprising is that news on the cryptocurrency surpassed news that covered events such as the 2017 Solar Eclipse as well as the horrendous Las Vegas massacre that took place across from the Mandalay Bay.  It’s almost comical that Bitcoin ranked number two, and was sought after on Google for the entire year, but then days leading up to 2018, the digital currency found itself in a slump.  What do I mean by a slump? Well, let’s just look at Bitcoin’s track record for the month of December. On December 10, the virtual currency hit an all-time high, moving past $19,800, but then found itself declining 12 days later to hit $10,400 on the popular U.S. Coinbase exchange. Since then, Bitcoin has struggled to stay above $11,000 but found itself sitting around $15,750 on December 27, and then back down to $14,000 on December 28.  Further, Google disclosed that “How to buy bitcoin” came in at third on its “How to…” search list.  It will be interesting to see if Bitcoin can keep its head above the water next year and if it will maintain its spot on Google’s top searches for 2018.

It has now been reported that Pavel Lerner, 40, was returned by his abductors on Friday, but is suffering from stress, and will not provide any comment on what happened in the forthcoming days. The exchange was founded back in 2013 and has since grown to become a respected exchange in the cryptocurrency sector, obtaining a presence with a number of developers from Russia, Thailand, and Spain, and financial advisers from the United Kingdom.   The news shocked the cryptocurrency community, both local and international, as Lerner is a well-known Russian blockchain expert, and as many know now, blockchain technology is what supports the virtual currency Bitcoin.  Exmo announced Friday that Lerner is safe and was returned with “no physical harm inflicted on him.”  Apparently what happened was that Lerner was leaving his office on Boxing Day when a group of “unknown masked people” approached him and threw him into a black car.  It’s unclear as to where Lerner was kept, or the reasons behind his kidnapping, but Exmo did confirm that Lerner was “thrown out on a motorway” by his kidnappers on Friday.  With more than 94,955 active users trading currencies on the Exmo exchange, it’s unnerving that such a thing could happen to this company. According to a spokeswoman for the company, authorities are looking into the matter.  Also this week, Exmo disclosed that it had suffered a cyber attack on Thursday. We do not know if the two cases are connected.  Featured Image: twitter",-39.599999999998545,0

It never used to be like that, in fact, for a while, it was the opposite; but over the past couple weeks, it has become more and more obvious that the digital currency – and a number of other cryptocurrencies – is in a slump.  Here’s what’s been going on as of late:  On December 10, Bitcoin reached an all-time high, moving past the $19,800 mark. However, 12 short days later, the digital currency dropped to $10,400 on the Coinbase exchange, which, for those who don’t know, is an extremely popular U.S. cryptocurrency exchange.  It doesn’t stop there, however. For the days following the drop from the all-time high, Bitcoin has struggled to stay above the $11,000 mark but managed to climb yesterday so it could sit at around $15,750. That was until today, when Bitcoin continued its decline, dropping below the $14,000 mark.  So, what happened? Is it just because people are losing faith in the world of cryptocurrency? Maybe. I definitely have; in fact, I predict that Bitcoin will drop to $9,000 by February of 2018 – but this isn’t about what I think.  Thursday’s drop in price came after South Korea announced to the public that it is thinking about shutting down exchanges. To no surprise, most cryptocurrencies dropped on the news, with Bitcoin down as much as 10%.  Commenting on the drop, Robert Watson, who is the head of asset allocation at Mercer, said that he does believe Bitcoin to be just a speculative bubble and that it is inevitable that the digital currency will “more or less” collapse in the near-future. That being said, if you are still interested in cryptocurrencies, but you are pivoting away from Bitcoin, Ethereum (which is down more than 7%), and Litecoin (down more than 10%), you might want to think about trading your cards in for Ripple, which has been increasing for the past two days straight, trading over 26% yesterday and 3.86% Thursday.   Featured image: Twitter",-1257.6000000000004,0

While some people are die-hard Bitcoin fans, others believe it is just a speculative bubble. For a while, it seemed that the digital currency wasn’t going to slow down at all, hitting an all-time high on December 10, but all of that changed very quickly when the virtual currency plunged on December 22 and has not gone past its all-time high since.  On Wednesday trade, Bitcoin was sitting at around $15,000 but has been struggling to stay above the $11,000 mark for the past couple days. This might be why William Galvin, who is the secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, announced today that Bitcoin is “entirely speculation,” and that it does not pass the “smell test.”  To some investors surprise – not mine though – Galvin announced that there is no product when it comes to the preeminent cryptocurrency, and it is all just speculation. He added that Bitcoin is so volatile because no is able to explain it or control it.  This isn’t entirely shocking to hear that Galvin feels this way considering he said two weeks ago that Bitcoin is a “worthless product,” providing a number of reasons to back up his statement.  It’s not just Galvin who feels this way, however. A number of people have come forward calling the virtual currency the new Ponzi scheme, with others saying it is going to drop to $8,000 next year. On December 11, Jay Clayton, Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange, posted a statement which described the dangers of investing in virtual currencies.  What do you think?

Looking back on 2017, one cannot deny that the preeminent crypto coin took the market by storm. It seems to be that people either love it or they hate it; either people are going to put all of their eggs in the cryptocurrency basket or they are going to argue that it is just a speculative bubble. Based on the latest couple of weeks, I’m going to say that it is the latter.  After hitting an all-time high on December 10, soaring well above the $19,800 mark, the digital currency plunged on December 22 to a low of $10,400 on the Coinbase exchange, which is one of the most popular digital currency exchanges in the United States. On Wednesday, in morning trade, the price was sitting at around $15,750. Bitcoin is definitely in the midst of a slump, and it is starting to affect a number of organizations in the sector. In fact, just last week, after Bitcoin fell more than 5% in 24 hours, both Riot Blockchain Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) and Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCMKTS:GBTC) shares plunged almost 20%.  Mentioned briefly, on Wednesday, December 27, Nick Colas, who has been covering Bitcoin for the past four years, stated that Bitcoin is in for a “wild ride” next year. Even though the digital currency has increased almost 1,600% over the course of the past year, Colas wholeheartedly believes the coin is going to experience a tremendous amount of volatility in the forthcoming year.  Elaborating further, Colas stated that in 2018 Bitcoin could be trading within a range of $6,500 to $22,000.  Meanwhile, others have come forward and said that the cryptocurrency is just another Ponzi scheme, or another Dutch Tulip Bulb Market Bubble, while others believe Bitcoin could drop to $8,000 next year. Personally, I am forecasting that Bitcoin will drop to $9,000 by February of 2018.  What do you think? What are your predictions for Bitcoin next year?

Currently, the coin’s price has readjusted to $14,860 since falling, so already it looks to be in a recovery phase – and this is what many analysts are focusing on and using to keep the calm among the crypto investors. Many analysts are encouraging investors, especially new-to-the-block investors, not to panic about the price drops and to hold onto their coins. A correction was bound to happen eventually; a thing can only go up so much before it needs to come back down a little, and these types of things happen all the time with market trading. This isn’t the first time the digital currency has dropped in market share (and it will no doubt be the last); at the end of the summer, the cryptocurrency saw a dip after increasing for many weeks. Many analysts, including Alan Silbert, who has long been versed in the crypto-sphere, believe that this is the correction that was expected, but that cryptocurrencies will recover. What could be causing the drop right now? It could have something to do with the launching of the Bitcoin futures contracts. Through those contracts, investors are able to short on Bitcoin, meaning they can bet against it essentially. On December 10, Cboe (NASDAQ:CBOE) launched its futures contracts, which was followed a week later on December 17 by CME (NASDAQ:CME) in its launching of its Bitcoin futures contracts. Both did exceptionally well, with the Cboe launch pushing Bitcoin 19% higher. Initially, the future contracts would cause Bitcoin price to increase, as an extremely high amount of people are trading or betting on it, but as that slowly begins to wear off, and people sit back to wait and see where their bets will land, Bitcoin’s price is going to be affected. That looks like what we’re seeing a bit of now. It could also be the time of year. ‘Tis the season, but maybe not for Bitcoin. Featured Image: twitter",-2066.2000000000007,0

One of the main reasons behind the current Bitcoin drop, experts say, is because of the high transaction fees that Bitcoin is subject to at the moment. According to Erik Voorhees, the CEO of ShapeShift (private) – a company that offers global trading on a variety of digital assets through web and mobile platforms – the average Bitcoin transaction fee has increased to $40 per transaction over the past 12 months. That’s a rate that is even higher than most bank wires. Higher Bitcoin transactions fees could be a reason behind Bitcoin’s current price slump (the high fees could be deterring some people from wanting to trade as much in Bitcoin), but another reason that has been given to the slump, which has declined another 5% as of Thursday, is linked to Ethereum, along with other altcoin cryptocurrencies in general. Bitcoin used to have the dominant share of the cryptocurrency world, but that share has dropped before, and this week it dropped again. Bitcoin now holds slightly less than 44% of the crypto market, which is the lowest that it has seen since August. The main factor behind this is that Ethereum has upped its share in a gaining price rally, as have several other altcoins such as Ripple. Ethereum increased its market share to 13%, effectively helping to lower Bitcoin’s share, thus reducing Bitcoin’s worth. Despite the slump, many analysts are saying not to panic. A drop like this is normal after the extreme growth Bitcoin saw this year (the last month alone saw Bitcoin soar from $8,000 to $19,000). Also, the slump certainly hasn’t been dissuading investors from speculating on Bitcoin’s future price. Just recently, an unknown trader, or group of traders, put up a million-dollar bet declaring that Bitcoin will reach $50,000 by the end of 2018.

ETFs are exchange-traded funds. The NYSE wants to list two ETFs that will use futures contracts to track the price of Bitcoin. If approved, traders would be able to bet on how the Bitcoin future contracts will perform. Adding an ETF to the trading of Bitcoin future contracts would add further legitimacy to them. The ETFs, which the NYSE filed with the SEC on Tuesday, December 19, is a follow up from when ProShares, the leading provider of ETFs, filed for them in September. At the time when ProShares filed them, the ETFs, ProShares Bitcoin ETF and ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF, were refused review by the SEC. The SEC claimed that the reason for this was because the underlying assets, in other words, the Bitcoin futures didn’t yet exist. The refiling of these particular ETFs has occurred now that Bitcoin futures contracts do exist and are currently being traded on the CME (NASDAQ:CME) and Cboe (NASDAQ:CBOE) exchanges. There has been no word from the SEC as of yet on the standing of the ETFs and whether or not they will be approved. The consensus among experts, however, is that they will be, or at least one of them will be. Both the CME and CBOE have been having success from their launches of the Bitcoin futures contracts, and the transition has been smooth so far. The likelihood that the NYSE will soon be able to list its ETFs is strong. If SEC does approve the ETFs, it could mark a huge moment for the cryptocurrency world, possibly being the thing to finally push Bitcoin into the mainstream financial world, making it accessible to more people.

He said, “I’m quite sure that 99 percent of the people that own Bitcoin do not understand how it works. That always is a cocktail for disaster.

At the time authorities seized almost $500,000 of Bitcoin. According to Time Magazine, Shamo was involved in black market synthetic opioid fentanyl sales. Since the seizing, the cryptocurrency has skyrocketed in price and is now worth over $8.5 million and the US Attorney’s Office for Utah wants to sell it off. The court papers cite the reason for the sale as being due to Bitcoin’s high volatility. Historically, the authority that investigates these cases are the ones to keep the funds from the seized assets. The defendant pled not guilty and his attorney is not contesting the sale of the Bitcoins that were seized. Earlier last week, Bulgaria had seized a substantial amount of Bitcoin from a criminal investigation. The country seized over 200,000 Bitcoins which equates to around one-fourth of the country’s national debt or around $4 billion dollars.

We hope to improve our own literacy of virtual currency by actually using it.” Actually using it would be a benefit for GMO Internet, as the company joined a Bitcoin trading and exchange business earlier in the year, and is also planning to launch a new cryptocurrency mining operation in future years. This mining operation will utilize “renewable energy and cutting-edge semiconductor chips in Northern Europe.” GMO Internet plans to continue its research into Bitcoin, and is looking to develop both hardware and software for the cryptocurrency.

As we reported back in November, the Russian cybercrime suspect was awaiting his fate as the U.S and Russia battled for his extradition. Vinnik was arrested back in July when the U.S requested that he be arrested as he was on vacation with his family. He is said to have laundered $4 billion USD worth of Bitcoin through BTC-e.  Vinnik had appealed his extradition to the U.S because his home country, Russia, held him on ridiculously lower charges of laundering 667,000 ruble which is around only $11,500 USD.  Greece’s Supreme Court has now upheld the US request and is supporting the extradition to the North California courts. Vinnik’s lawyer said in an official statement following the ruling stating, “The Supreme Court has in essence accepted that our client should be sent to the United States.” It is now up to the justice minister to decide his ultimate fate, as the two options present radically different legal punishments.   Featured Image: twitter",1105.6000000000022,1

According to Lee, bitcoin will continue to see growth because millennials have taken such an intense interest in it. The strategist has said that the millennial generation will power the currency, comparing it to the way baby boomers helped the stock market in the 80s. On Tuesday, December 12, Lee stated that millennials have taken a liking to not only bitcoin but also social media and digital organizations. “I think what viewers have to appreciate is, this is a millennial story,” Lee said. Back in October of this year, Tom Lee forecasted that the virtual currency will eventually hit the $25,000 mark by the year 2022. These predictions don’t seem that far-fetched either considering during 2017 bitcoin has posted a whopping 1,700% growth, hitting more than $17,00 this month.

In an interview this week with the Financial Times on CNN, Belfort discussed his thoughts on the world’s first digital currency and the issues he finds with it.  While, he believes there will be further implementation of the digital currency more mainstream he doesn’t see the value of it, due to its limited supply. Belfort talks about the “shorting” that is currently occurring with the Bitcoin futures and believes it will catapult the price and the demand. However, he doubts with the limited supply and due to the possibility of regulations from various places, the digital currency will fall sharply.   The major issue he has with cryptocurrency is the fundraising tactics of initial coin offerings, calling them a “gigantic scam” that will eventually blow up in investors faces. He made a statement pretty profound, as he was found guilty of fraud to stock-market manipulation but he adds that ICOs are, “far worse than anything I was ever doing.” He essentially doesn’t see anything wrong with digital currency or even the fundraising but says that the majority of people don’t have ill intentions but the small amount that do, will ruin it for everyone. He is alongside a lot of individuals comparing the Bitcoin rise to the “Tulip Bulb” crisis in Holland back in the 1960s, pointing out that once people started trading futures of the commodity, it came crashing down.  He does believe that people are able to make some money on this cryptocurrency frenzy but need to be able to “pull” out and not enter again. Ultimately, he believes due to human nature this entire thing will blow up in everyone’s face and gives a clear warning of this. He states that it won’t affect these billionaire investors but will be devastating to the ‘middle-class’ average joes that place their bets on the market.

He believes that they will eventually become obsolete and that Bitcoin would replace them entirely. Netanyahu bases his entire claim based on blockchain technologies’ trustless nature and the growth the cryptocurrency has seen within the last year.  In the video, the Prime Minister states that banks will eventually become outdated and easily replaced, saying, “Is the fate of banks that they will eventually disappear? Yes. The answer is yes. Does it need to happen tomorrow? And do we need to do it through Bitcoin? That’s a question mark.” The head of the Israeli state also spoke on the roles of banks explaining that their primary reason for existence was to ensure transactions between two people are secure and valid. He also states that the banks control how money is spent and benefit from having that control, at the cost of the transacting parties. Blockchain technology allows users to communicate directly and secures and validates transactions more quickly, in comparison to the traditional banking infrastructure currently.

On the platform itself, there is an array of items that have to do with cryptocurrency from various apparel with bitcoin emblem’s placed on them, mining contracts, hardware wallets and even mining computers. The one major thing missing, is being able to purchase goods in the cryptocurrency.  According to Cutler, the company is not quite there “yet.” This move would be a massive step towards the adoption of the digital currency. However, Steam, an online game retailer, just announced they will no longer accept Bitcoin as a means of purchase on their platform due to time it takes between the customer’s purchase and the company actually receiving the funds.  The difference between Steam and eBay’s platforms is that eBay is a marketplace, and it wouldn’t matter to them which currency is used as long as they receive their fee per transaction. The acceptance of the payment model wouldn’t be that much of a hindrance for the company, as it was for Steam so it’s adoption seems promising.  Craigslist just started accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment on-the-low but didn’t announce its new features to the public. For now, the eBay collaboration is in the idea phase, but with the holiday’s knocking on the door it might happen sooner rather than later. Featured Image: twitter",-1091.7999999999993,0

Wright tweeted that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) had everything to gain in 2018; it will have more security, and what it will be capable of achieving will be limitless. He said that 2018 will bring “secure threshold systems to make even web wallets secure.” There will also be an improvement in privacy by making transactions blind, and there will be improved mixers. Wright further said that the BCH team would be spreading the cryptocurrency around the world, getting more people using it and thus driving the price up. When asked if the 2018 roadmap was well planned, Wright tweeted back, “It is well planned. There are many things coming. We are interested in delivering cash to the world. Not a bank settlement system. So, it is all about whether you believe in PayPal 1.5 in BTC or global cash in BCH.” Wright is asking users to come up with merchant solutions to help with the progress of BCH and is expecting a higher user rate of the cryptocurrency with the many new services and businesses climbing on board. The mining pool ViaBTC will be launching a crypto-to-crypto exchange platform that will have a focus on BCH, and there will also be a Bitcoin Cash Visa debit card coming out. Only time will tell whether the new year will bring a new spring to Bitcoin Cash’s step. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© PromesaStudio",-1091.7999999999993,0

The business head invested in the world’s first digital currency back in 2012 and believes the cryptocurrency will rise exponentially in the next twenty years as it more adopted mainstream. His price analysis isn’t far off from many other investors and tech leaders, who have predicted the price of Bitcoin to reach close to the $1 million level. In his interview Palihapitiya explains his predictions as such: “This thing has the potential to be comparable to the value of gold…This is a fantastic hedge and store of value against autocratic regimes and banking infrastructure that we know is corrosive to how the world needs to work properly…I think this thing is a $100,000 a coin in the next 3-4 years, and in the next 20 years will be $1 mln.” The founder’s main argument is that the digital currency offers a cover against the massive problems that could be potentially caused by the world’s current banking structure. If the banks were to fail, like the housing crisis back in 2008, Bitcoin is entirely disconnected from the platform and that’s the exact reason why the digital currency was created in the first place.

According to CCN, Ron Paul designed a poll on his Twitter in which he asked his followers where they would invest a $10,000 gift that they could not touch for roughly 10 years. In the poll, Paul let his followers choose from Bitcoin, Gold, Federal Reserve Notes, or 10 year U.S. Treasury Bonds.  The results? More than half of respondents (70,513 users voted) said they would rather invest in bitcoin, while 36% said they would rather invest in gold.  In an interview with Kitco News, Ron Paul disclosed that he was “surprised” by the results that the poll showed. However, he felt a bit better that the majority of people would not entrust their $10,000 investment to a government-connected financial instrument.  Here’s what Paul had to say:  “Of course, bitcoin is very exciting, and it’s booming, but [bitcoin investors] don’t have a long-term perspective. What’s it going to be like in 10 years? Nobody knows. But we have a pretty good idea of where gold will be, in a general sense.” Keep in mind this poll was not scientific, and it was also posted on Twitter, which usually has a young demographic – just like digital currency investors.

According to securities regulator Joseph Borg, people have started going as far as taking out mortgages in order to buy Bitcoin. And this, says Borg, is a huge mistake, “This is not something a guy who’s making $100,000 a year, who’s got a mortgage and two kids in college ought to be invested in.” Most recently, Bitcoin was trading at $16,700 on Coinbase. But it’s a volatile industry, its price constantly changing, up and down. There’s not going to be anywhere to hide if the bubble bursts, which some people believe could happen at any moment. That’s not a place you want to be in, especially not with a new mortgage on the line. The Bitcoin craze, increasing since the beginning of the year, might finally be getting out of hand if this is how far people are willing to go to get a piece of the action – and it’s probably going to go even further.

Van-Peterson also believes the other cryptocurrencies could benefit and “do better” in regards to price growth from this. The strategist sees Ethereum being the next candidate for EFTs and the next ‘contender’ in the cryptocurrency arena.  He added, “The astonishing thing – mindblowing if you will – is that you take a step back and look at the price appreciation… a lot of this has happened without traditional institutional money, and that’s basically going to be coming on board over the next six to 18 months.” Bitcoin has had a monumental year, passing most financial analysts predictions for its short-term growth and many are now pondering what could be next for the digital currency. Even Van-Peterson’s prediction back in May of Bitcoin hitting $100,000 within the next ten years, is now less surprising as he has now altered his timeframe for the digital currency.

These early adopters, who happen to be a mix of technology devotees and bold entrepreneurs, hold a large majority of the sway of the cryptocurrency.  The holders of large amounts of bitcoin are called “whales” and according to bloomberg, only 1,000 people currently hold 40 percent of all the existing 16,734,762 circulating Bitcoin supply. So, how much control do these 1,000 people really have over the entire Bitcoin market? What happens if one day they decide to cash out, simultaneously or decide to join the futures route? The world’s largest cryptocurrency, recently saw a dip after a monstrous rally as it’s two biggest exchanges went offline after record-breaking traffic. Bitcoin hit around the $19,000 mark before crashing to nearly $14,000 in mere hours, over a 20 percent drop. The reason for this dip was due to fear and others cashing out for bigger profits.  This example of a minor market manipulation shows how just a few thousand coins can make the market move, should large groups decide to buy/sell. Also, this particular manipulation is not exactly coordinated and just all a part of the process but what is there was a coordinated move? Back on November 12th, an undisclosed individual moved almost 25,000 bitcoins, which was worth $159 million at the time, to a specific online exchange. The news broke throughout the community and many traders feared the owner selling that large amount at one time. It never occurred but many within the Bitcoin community feared the potential ramifications of selling of such a large amount of the cryptocurrency at once. Many fear the high volatility of Bitcoin, which is inevitably the only thing that is predictable with its market. There are many, though, that welcome the dip in the cryptocurrency and see it as an opportunity to buy up “discounted” Bitcoins. Thus emphasizing the issue, a coordinated sell-off between the whales could potentially cause a “flood” in the market and the move would manipulate it to a lower price. There have also been rumors of a trader with unlimited money who was personally manipulating the Bitcoin market. There has been no sign of a coordinated strike between these whales, yet. Who knows if they even understand the magnitude of their alliance or if they even know who each other are. Entering this week though, there are dangers lurking as the first round of Bitcoin futures have launched on CBOE. CME is set to the launch their futures contracts on Sunday and NASDAQ in their Q2 in 2018.  These futures allow different sets of Bitcoin investors to enter the market, which could completely make the current Bitcoin whales almost insignificant with the amount of money that could be potentially dumped in. However, with futures trading, there is a protection for a big price drop, and also a big opportunity to profit from either a drop or a rise. This means big incentives for investors to manipulate Bitcoin’s small market, with large amounts of money. Will these Whales also jump on these futures and manipulate its price to gain profit?  We shall see. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Christian",1509.3999999999996,1

Unlike the outages that occurred last week on the Coinbase system, the CBOE outage didn’t cause Bitcoin’s price to fall.   Source: Bloomberg What are Bitcoin futures exactly? Futures trading has been around since the 19th century and it allows two parties to exchange an asset, at a specific price on an agreed upon date in the future. When this contract settles the buyer of the contract receives their payment in the product itself or in cash. These exchanges will halt for brief periods, if the price of the cryptocurrency spikes more than 30 percent, as you can see displayed on the chart above. CBOE and the upcoming CME futures, ill be settled in cash. This is appealing to mainstream investors because they can bet on the price of Bitcoin, without having to hold on the cryptocurrency what-so-ever.  CBOE’s Chief Strategy Officer Jon Deters, told Business Insider, “People will be able to settle in cash. So you can take a speculative position without touching bitcoin itself, which helps make it more attractive to all sorts of folks.” The arrivals of these futures is a huge milestone for the digital currency, as it was once only associated with drug dealing and other illegal activities, by investors.  These futures are anticipated to bring down the high volatility of the cryptocurrency as major institutions and high volumes of money, are involved.

Bitcoin is way more portable and way more divisible.”  Additionally, Cameron noted that if the currency can continue to disturb the gold market, it is on the path to reach a trillion dollars in a very small time frame, seeing as the market value for the currency is already verging $300 billion.  Not only that, but the twins stated that other cryptocurrencies don’t stand a chance against the virtual currency and are not a competition in any way. “Bitcoin is not competing with those other currencies.

Let me explain further:  For years, Andreas Antonopoulos has been present at conferences and events in the hopes of informing the world about bitcoin, a digital currency. And just last week, Antonopoulos revealed that while he might be an influential figure in the cryptocurrency sector, he is still dealing with debts in US dollars.  “My small savings that I do have are invested in bitcoin. 100 percent [of it]. I actually have a tiny debt in US dollars that I’m still trying to pay off so it is more than 100 percent in bitcoin. Now, I’d like to emphasize again, that is not a recommendation to invest. Because I haven’t invested by money in bitcoin, I invested my career, my intellectual capacity, my creativity energy, my passion, and my work in bitcoin. The money is the least of the investment that I have made in bitcoin and I could lose everything of it and I’d still have everything else,” he said.  Then, on December 5, investor Roger Ver stated that if Antonopoulos invested $300 five years, he would be a millionaire today. Antonopoulos simply responded:  “I did invest, Roger. Then I sold in 2013 to pay my rent. I didn’t have disposable income to work for two years without pay and invest at the same time. I should’ve gone into more debt, but that would have been irresponsible towards my family who I supported.” As a result of Ver’s statement, the bitcoin community asked bitcoin supports to show their loyalty and support to Andreas Antonopoulos, the man who helped get the virtual currency the recognition it deserves. Within 48 hours, the community raised over $1.6 million for the highly respected public figure. Featured Image: twitter  ",-1345.0999999999985,0

This form of money was introduced to the US back in 1775 and eventually was deemed completely worthless by 1782. Greenspan spoke to CNBC recently and made claims that the Bitcoin, the world’s first digital currency, is irrational and feels it will have the same fate as the Continental currency did. During that time, the currency was not supported by any sort of commodity. Even though the currency has no apparent value, it was still used to create goods and services. The former chairman urges that this is the current state of Bitcoin. He said, “Bitcoin is really a fascinating example of how human beings create value and is not always rational … It is not a rational currency in that case.” The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value has gained thousands of dollars in value over the last few days. As per CoinMarketCap and at press-time, Bitcoin is selling at $15,919.30 up over 20 percent in just 48 hours.  The monumental trajectory of Bitcoin’s price this year has caused many senior financial officers to speak up, such as JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon who has called Bitcoin both a “fraud” and a bubble.

Their government is now sitting on $3.5 billion USD, at today’s Bitcoin price. Back on May 19th of this year, a press release was sent out by the Southeast European Law Enforcement Center (SELEC) stating that a total of 213,519 Bitcoins were seized that month. The regional organization that seized these digital coins were composed of 12 states including Bulgaria. During the seizure, 23 Bulgarian nationals were detained and had been apart of an alleged customs fraud scam.  According to CoinMarketCap and at press-time, Bitcoin is selling at $17,551.10 per coin.  Per the press release, authorities stated, “The offenders choose the bitcoin way of investing/saving the money, because it is rather difficult to be tracked and followed.” The added that those that were involved hacked into Bulgarian customs with a virus, skipping paying the fees to import goods into the country. Government agents were bribed by the perpetrators and the virus was uploaded by them.   Overall, they dodged paying 10 million leva (Bulgaria’s currency) which is world nearly $6 million USD. At this time, what remains unknown is what the Bulgarian government is doing with the Bitcoins that were seized. According to Bivol.bg, the government declined to disclose further details on the subject due to the ongoing investigation. According to a report from Bivol.bg from Nov. 28, the Bulgarian government declined to release further details, citing an ongoing criminal investigation. Featured Image: twitter",3633.6000000000004,1

The company claims that the cryptocurrency has become “untenable” due to its extremely high transaction fees and the high level of instability in its value. Valve explained its decision, “In the past few months we’ve seen an increase in the volatility in the value of Bitcoin and a significant increase in the fees to process transactions on the Bitcoin network. For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled Bitcoin). These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of Bitcoin itself drops dramatically.” Bitcoin value goes through extreme fluctuations over the course of very little time, making transactions difficult and irritating. If a transaction is ongoing at the time of a change in Bitcoin’s value, the amount required to complete the purchase may reflect something different at the end of the transaction than what the user originally started with. With the recent surge of Bitcoin increasing $1000 in 24 hours, Valve has seen more and more customers getting stuck in this scenario. When this happens, Valve either refunds the overpaid amount, or the customer is required to pay additional funds. In either scenario, the customer is faced with an additional Bitcoin transaction fee from the original one connected with the purchase. “With the transaction fee being so high right now, it is not feasible to refund or ask the customer to transfer the missing balance (which itself runs the risk of underpayment again, depending on how much the value of Bitcoin changes while the Bitcoin network processes the additional transfer),” commented Valve. Valve has decided the hassle isn’t worth it anymore, and that it is affecting user experience, so Bitcoin payment will no longer be a part of its gaming experience. Valve has said that it may reintroduce Bitcoin as payment later on in the future, if the cryptocurrency ever stabilizes, but for now, Bitcoin is out. Featured Image: twitter",3633.6000000000004,1

Two Bitcoin futures will be launching in December: the Chicago-based exchange, Cboe Global Markets on the 10th, and CME Group on the 18th. Nasdaq won’t be far behind, already planning a launch for the beginning of 2018, while the Tokyo Financial Exchange has also reported that it will be launching its own Bitcoin derivatives futures product. These announcements have been met with criticism from the major brokers. The Futures Industry Association, which is made up of banks including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), claims that the implementation of Bitcoin futures contracts “did not allow for proper public transparency and input.” The fact that Cboe and the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) have agreed to function under a self-certified regime for their contracts has led to little satisfaction, due to that fact that a self-certification regime for “these novel products does not align with the potential risks that underlie their trading and should be reviewed.” The main issue for members of the Futures Industry Association is the reliability of prices underlying the Bitcoin futures contracts. Bitcoin price is constantly fluctuating, and while it has moved up quickly this past month, more than 50%, the qualms are that it would also be capable of falling just as quickly and drastically.

On Wednesday, several NiceHash users reported some unusual activity in their BTC wallets, several of them found their wallets to be completely empty. Soon after these reports, NiceHash announced that it would be temporarily closing for maintenance. 12 hours after the service went offline for this maintenance, NiceHash released a statement saying that they had experienced a security breach which was compromising their payment services and that the service would continue to be closed for the next 24 hours while they investigated the situation.  source: thehackernews Several users began tweeting NiceHash, saying that their money had been stolen. “Either I got hacked or something is up,” tweeted Erik Callesen, showing an outgoing transaction of $56 million he claims to have not made. NiceHash has not confirmed the total amount of Bitcoin that was stolen, however, CoinDesk has reported that as much as 4,736.42 in Bitcoins were stolen, which at the time of the report was worth over $62 million. With the jump that Bitcoin price has recently taken, the total amount of Bitcoin stolen could be as much as $70 million now, if not more. There have been several fingers pointed at a particular Bitcoin wallet address that, when it opened on Tuesday at 9:07 pm, went from a balance of 0.01 Bitcoin to a balance of 4,655.25 Bitcoin in just ten minutes, with over 3,000 transactions made by the user – and the number has climbed since. Confirmation has been made by RT America after looking into the suspicious activity reported by the users claiming to have been hacked, and it looks like their money was indeed transferred to the mysterious Bitcoin wallet address. NiceHash has commented that they have begun an investigation into the matter, and that “relevant authorities and law enforcement” have been notified. They are “co-operating with them as a matter of urgency.” NiceHash head of marketing Andrej P. Škraba has said that the hack was “a highly professional attack with sophisticated social engineering.” Despite this, the company assures its users that it is “fully committed to restoring the NiceHash service with the highest security measures at the earliest opportunity.” However, how the company will be able to rectify matters if total compensation is unable to be achieved remains up in the air. In the meantime, NiceHash is encouraging users to change their passwords, both on their NiceHash accounts as well as on other services. Featured Image: twitter",3633.6000000000004,1

The results may have nothing to do with the cryptocurrency itself but more so about the latest nominee at the Federal Reserve (The Fed). Marvin Goodfriend, has been called the ‘worst Fed nominee in History’ and a visionary by various news sources. However,  Still, the newest addition to the Fed may be contributing greatly to the rise of Bitcoin. Goodfriend’s anti-cash views are the first of its kind, from a person in his position.  The new representative had voiced his opinions that paper money puts financial freedom in the hands of the people, a plot that he does not like if a crisis were to occur. During such crisis, the Fed usually lowers interest rates for individuals, in order to increase the borrowing power for consumers and small businesses. The issue is that if the Fed were to lower interest rates to something close to zero on checking and savings accounts, people now have the power to simply withdraw physical money from their accounts to stop the potential of them losing money. Goodfriend, does not like this freedom to protect the value of money and believes that cash is the limiting factor that holds back the power of the Fed from controlling the economy.  This rigid monetary stance might be the cause of the recent spike in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Should such stiff government policies come into existence, digital currencies might present a better method for trading and interact with currency that would be completely out of the Federal Reserve’s control. This is the exact reason why Bitcoin was created in the first place, back in 2008.  Obviously, there have been other factors in the rise of Bitcoin but Goodfriend’s remarks and opinions may have boosted its price unintentionally.

A car owner in the U.K has now listed his Gold Ghost Rolls-Royce for sale on the major website Autotrader but is only selling it in Bitcoin and not in pounds. If you were to buy a brand new Rolls-Royce from the dealership it would cost you over £230,000 but with only 35,000 kilometers, this 2010 would only cost you £117,000 in Bitcoin.

Howell did, however, keep the hard drive with the keys to his digital wallet for a few years before eventually throwing it in the trash, yikes.  Currently, one bitcoin is now trading for just under $13,000 USD which would’ve made him up a ‘mere’ $96 million. Now, the money just sits in a random landfill somewhere. Howell joked about digging it up back in 2013 to the Guardian but is now making plans to dig it up.  “A modern landfill is a complex engineering project and digging one up brings up all sorts of environmental issues such as dangerous gasses and potential landfill fires.

It’s hard to tell who is going to be right, but if it is the doubters, there are a lot of people who are going to lose a lot – unless of course, something was to warn them of any impending crash. That’s the intention of the Bitcoin Bubble Burst app. The app was developed to scan Bitcoin markets, news, and social media platforms and to signal the user if any of these platforms indicate a potential market crash in the future. The app provides real-time price change alerts to users by using algorithms based on Bitcoin price change data. Could this really be the saving grace investors are looking for? Maybe, but it’d be best to view it with a grain of salt and investors may not want to use it as their main decision maker in regards to Bitcoin and its future. Any number of things could go wrong with the scanning or reporting system, and a large number of bad news reports could trigger sell-off messages on the app, and others like it, which could actually cause the very situation they are trying to predict. However, developers are optimistic: “Utilizing sentiment analytics we can get a numeric picture of the current event. Our model learns which patterns are ‘odd’ and when to contact you via notification.” If nothing else, the app and its counterparts will be useful in monitoring real-time data from a broad domain of exchanges and the worldwide trade of Bitcoin, and it will be good to have a regulated system for monitoring the very quick value changes of Bitcoin.

Coinbase will be handling all the payments for the company. CEO Sudhin Shahani said that the move to accept Bitcoin and Ethereum is a part of their wider efforts to disrupt air services. “Digital currency has been on our radar from the very beginning and we are excited to provide our members with another quick and seamless way to do business with Surf Air,” he said. There are many other small airlines that are doing as Surf Air has done, some taking it even further by looking into the applications of blockchain and how they may be beneficial to ticket disbursement and maintenance tracking.

According to a few cryptocurrency analysts, this addition may produce a platform for a large pending ‘short’ market. As Bitcoin has high volatility and the potential to fall, it could lead to a massive number of certain investors taking those ‘short’ positions.  In a recent article published by Bloomberg, hedge funds may force some massive pressure and begin to take advantage of what they see as potentially the “greatest shorting opportunity in history.” Lou Kern, a Flight VC partner and long-time cryptocurrency investor stated:  According to cryptocurrency investor Lou Kerner, a partner at Flight VC: “[It may be] one of the greatest shorting opportunities ever. You have a lot of zealotry, and a lot of people, including me, who think it’s the greatest thing to ever happen in the history of mankind. You have a lot of people who think it’s a bubble and a Ponzi scheme. It turns out both of them can’t be right.” The addition of Bitcoin futures into the market will have major impacts into bringing mainstream investment money into the cryptocurrency space, where it’s long or short. Regardless of the price, Bitcoin’s overall ecosystem should begin to stabilize considerably with the influx of investors. If a large amount of money were to move into the short position and Bitcoin’s price was to rise, the results could become the largest ‘short squeeze’ of all-time. So what’s a ‘short squeeze’, you ask? This squeeze takes place when a densely shorted stock rises in price, which then forces short contract holders to “squeeze” out of their short positions at a loss and thus driving the price father up with heightened pressure.

As a result,  has decided to assert all of its legal rights and remedies against this agitator and his associates,” said Hoegner. The identities of these false information spreaders have been withheld, but Bitfinex public relations executive Ronn Torossian has said of the matter, “I think you can infer who.” Torossian further commented, “In recent months, certain parties and their associates have made false and unsubstantiated claims against Bitfinex, engaging in potential market manipulation activity that is dishonest and unlawful.” The inference we are meant to make, it would seem, is Bitfinex’ed, as they released a statement claiming that the lawsuit against Bitfinex will be defended. “I am officially seeking donations to defend myself against Bitfinex’s frivolous lawsuit, rather than showing their numbers they seek to silence me,” wrote Bitfinex’ed.

How achieved this, was installing a Bitcoin mining computer in the trunk of his car and is charged by the car’s battery while it mines the cryptocurrency. This is a new and innovative way to mine Bitcoin that has never been done before and what makes it so lucrative is that the there is no cost to mine the cryptocurrency, as energy bills have said to be pretty expensive. The only cost associated with this process would be the car itself and the equipment to do the mining. New creative methods of mining will continue to arise as the world’s largest cryptocurrency, continues to increase in its price. While the use of the superchargers in the electric vehicles could be an awesome workaround to paying the high electricity bills associated with mining, owners could face potential issues with their cars.  Among one of the biggest concerns would be that the mining computers produce an abundant amount of heat and that could potentially damage the car’s internal parts over an extended period of time. Also, the car’s battery remains untested and could become damaged when it’s used continuously for a period of time, during the mining process. Despite the good amount of profit that could be made with the mining, Tesla owners should weigh the potential effects it may have on the performance of their not-so-cheap cars. Those wanting to save some money mining the digital currencies are encouraged to explore alternative methods such as renewable energies and they could use solar panels instead.

In an interview with CNBC, Ken Griffin declared that bitcoin is as popular as it is in our modern world because society is confusing it with blockchain technology, which, according to Griffin, serves more purpose and has merit.  Based on Griffin’s take on the matter, blockchain technology is likely to have overpowering social implications in the forthcoming years. Additionally, Griffin stated that blockchain technology takes away the need for third parties as it creates safe, fast, and permanent transaction records.  The problem, to Griffin, is that people don’t know the difference between blockchain technology and bitcoin, which is causing individuals to purchase the digital currency without a clue as to what they are actually buying.  Unlike other financial experts, Griffin does not believe bitcoin is a fraud, but he does appearing to be sticking to the fact that bitcoin is a bubble that will inevitably hurt society. This, of course, is not the first team bitcoin has been referred to as a ‘bubble’.  For those who don’t know, Ken Griffin founded the Citadel hedge fund management firm, which now holds over $27B in assets. Currently, according to Forbes, Griffin’s net worth sits at around $8.6B.

It is a bet that will leave bitcoin pessimists hoping that he is right about his forecast of the direction that the digital currency is heading in.  For those who don’t know, McAfee is the latest addition to the MGT Capital Investments team, and he joined as chief cybersecurity visionary right as the MGT Capital made their transition into the world of the blockchain.  The former Libertarian presidential candidate tweeted the following about the currency:  “When I predicted Bitcoin at $500,000 by the end of 2020, it used a model that predicted $5,000 at the end of 2017. BTC has accelerated much faster than my model assumptions. I now predict Bitcoin at $1 million by the end of 2020. I will still eat my dick if wrong.” While it is quite the statement, one cannot help but wonder if he is correct in his prediction. Meanwhile, others are wondering if McAfee should have even increased his bitcoin price target in the first place, considering others have claimed the currency is just a bubble. Over the course of the past few months, McAfee has become much more vocal about the digital currency, even stating that he forecasts BTC and BCH fighting for the “Bitcoin” name.

The aim of the bill? To criminalize the deliberate suppression of control or ownership of a financial account.  Additionally, bill S.1241 will modify the definition of both ‘financial institution’ and ‘financial account’ to include cryptocurrencies and their exchanges. According to Senator Dianne Feinstein, bill S.1241 is essential in order to update existing AML laws.  As mentioned, the proposed bill will alter the definition of ‘financial institution.’ The definition will be changed in Section 53412(a) of title 31 to include:  “An issuer, redeemer, or cashier of prepaid access devices, digital currency, or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency.” If things go as planned and bill S.1241 is passed, it will likely have effects for anyone using cryptocurrencies in the United States and out of the country.  There are a number of industry experts who have raised their opinions on bill S.1241. In fact, Tone Vays has said that he forecasts there to be a faceoff between the holders and users of Bitcoin and the United States government.  “It’s bad…I think it’s gonna end in a very confrontational way between Bitcoin—even Bitcoin holders and users—and the US Government.” Further, there have been a couple reports that have surfaced which suggest that the White House is monitoring digital currencies.

Well, here’s another one: the White House is keeping a close eye on digital currencies – and that includes bitcoin. Do you know why this is a problem? It’s because this means the White House is trying to find a way to control the decentralized monetary system. On Thursday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, White House Press Secretary, announced during a press conference that bitcoin is “something that is being monitored by our team.” Her statement comes after a Buzzfeed reporter asked her whether or not Trump believes the currency should have more regulatory attention from the government.  Sanders added, “In terms of specific briefings and announcements on it, I don’t have anything that I can share with you right now.”  She also said Homeland Security has talked to President Trump about the matter recently. “Tom Bossert, with the Homeland Security team, an advisor to the president, has brought this up in a meeting earlier this week,” Sanders said.”I know this is something he is keeping an eye on.” When asked about Sanders’ press conference, billionaire hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz told Fox Business that “Ms. Sanders probably had prepared for the question and I’m sure Homeland Security is looking at it, the Treasury has looked at it, the Fed has looked at it.” While Trump has never actually talked about bitcoin publicly, we do know that he has a few pro-bitcoin contacts in his black book.

The following day, Robert J. Shiller opened up on the subject of the digital currency. And it’s not pretty.  Shiller believes that bitcoin will inevitably crash, and when it does, it will bear a resemblance to what happened to the stock market after the Great Depression. Additionally, the economist likened the appeal of the currency to a “mystery movie.” What does that mean? Well, because it has a certain appeal to it; it attracts anyone hoping to pull a fast one on the system.  For those who don’t know, Shiller was the recipient of the Nobel Prize in 2013. Plus, he predicted the housing bubble and the dot-com, so it’s no wonder people listen to him.  During a conference in Lithuania this week Shiller stated:  “Bitcoin, it’s just absolutely exciting ( …) You’re fast. You’re smart. You’ve figured out nobody else understands. You’re with it. And bitcoin has this anti-government, anti-regulation feel. It’s such a wonderful story. If it were only true.” He also noted that he doesn’t know if, when, or where bitcoin is going to end.  With that being said, despite having spot-on predictions in the past, Shiller might be wrong about bitcoin as there doesn’t seem, thus far, to be any sort of data that supports a crash.

In a statement released by the CFTC this morning, they announced the CBOE Futures Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange self-certified their new contracts for Bitcoin futures. Also, the Canto exchange has self-certified a contract for Bitcoin binary options. To clarify what the means, the ‘futures’ make it available to bet on Bitcoin’s price without having to buy the digital currency. Both exchanges have confirmed that their futures will settle in cash. Bitcoin has grown over 1,300 percent this year, due to growing interest from a wealthy manager and big retail traders. If these futures run smoothly, it could open the door for wider adoption among Wall Street.  The decision made by the CFTC this morning also came with a warning, they cautioned others due to the market being highly unsupervised. CFTC’s Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo said in the statement,  “Bitcoin, a virtual currency, is a commodity unlike any the Commission has dealt with in the past.”  Since the announcement, CME rose 1.7 percent and reached an all-time high this Friday morning. However, CBOE’s stock trades have changed very little today. From it’s original launch date of December 11th, CME has announced today from their website that they will begin on Monday, December 18. CBOE has yet to announce a specific date but a spokesperson from the exchange told CNBC that it will “probably” happen before the end of the year. The person states, “We are operationally ready and we will be announcing a launch date shortly.” There has been various reports lately that Nasdaq has plans of launching their own Bitcoin futures around June of 2018. A spokesperson from the exchange told CNBC that it would “base its price off of 50 Bitcoin sources from around the world.” CME is only using four sources and CBOE is only using one source, for their futures.

So what caused Bitcoin to jump that much? How did Bitcoin reach $10,000? One of the reasons, experts say, is due to institutional money. Investments from anywhere from hedge funds to pension funds to corporate businesses have been pouring into the cryptocurrency market and the fact that Bitcoin is now being supported by so much institutional money is a big reason for its advancement. Accounting firms and banks from around the world are supporting Bitcoin now when they weren’t before and this marks a major shift. Bitcoin is being adopted into the mainstream. Both those who have done research on the market, as well as investors unfamiliar with cryptocurrency, are putting money into Bitcoin right now. There are new streams of people getting involved with Bitcoin every day, and the more people supporting it, the more news about Bitcoin is generated, the more Bitcoin grows. Even at these levels though, only an estimated half-percent of the global population uses digital currency, meaning that there is still more room for Bitcoin to grow if it can keep its market going. Sol Lederer, Blockchain Director at LOOMIA has said of the growing cryptocurrency, “Bitcoin’s future is still uncertain; it faces the same serious technical challenges it has for years and faces stiff competition from newer, more sophisticated Blockchains. But even if it were to crash, it’s apparent that Bitcoin is here to stay. Whether it trades at $10,000, $5,000, or $500, it’s not going away.” Featured Image: twitter",777.0,1

The reason? Because Stiglitz believes the market for Bitcoin is driven primarily by its potential to get around certain government organizations.  In Stiglitz’s statement – which appeared to be more of a rant – he added that the Bitcoin market will fluctuate for a while, and then eventually hit a wall, leaving hundreds of investors injured. For these reasons, Stiglitz believes cryptocurrencies should be banned. He also added that Bitcoin does not have a “socially useful function.”  It’s not just cryptocurrency that Dr. Stiglitz is reportedly looking to take down. He might also want to ban the FANG stocks, which stands for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).  Some might be shocked by that, while others might have wanted the same ban to occur. If consumer protection is your goal, then FANG stocks are extremely risky and could be worthy of a ban.

PwC accepted bitcoin as payment for its advisory services, as it is currently working with multiple startups that deal in bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry. PwC has also started to advise clients about various cryptocurrency related options, such as funds and investments, exchanges, and ICOs. “This decision helps illustrate how we are embracing new technology and incorporating innovative business models across our full range of services,” said PwC Asia-Pacific chairman Raymund Chao. “It is also an indication that bitcoin and other established cryptocurrencies have now developed into more broadly accepted forms of settlement.” PwC is not the first accounting firm to accept bitcoin as payment for its services. Ernst & Young (EY) in Switzerland accepted bitcoin for its auditing and advisory services at the beginning of 2017. EY also set up a Bitcoin ATM among its offices, providing its employees with a digital bitcoin wallet within its in-house EY wallet app. Accepting bitcoin as payment was essential for EY’s strategy of “digitizing itself.” Featured Image: twitter",326.8099999999995,1

Based on a statement from a meeting of the state Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet), lawmakers strongly believe Bitcoin has a “speculative” nature which makes purchasing and selling it an ‘inappropriate’ act for Muslims.  Here’s the translated statement:  “Buying and selling virtual currencies is not compatible with religion at this time because of the fact that their valuation is open to speculation. They can be easily used in illegal activities like money laundering, and they are not under the state’s audit and surveillance.” For those who don’t know, Diyanet put the guidance into action on November 24, which means it was only a couple days before Bitcoin’s latest bull run.  After Turkey’s banning of PayPal, the transcontinental country has since been a target of Bitcoin startups, however, conditions over there have continued to be unstable.  In the statement, Diyanet noted that the “unsuitability” principles also apply to Ethereum.  Featured Image: Depositphotos/© yamabikay",326.8099999999995,1

Bitcoin hit its all-time high on Wednesday, reaching $11,441, but skeptics like Blankfein aren’t jumping to get in on the action, perhaps for good reason. Since this record-breaking level, bitcoin has been struggling to maintain the $10,000 threshold it had been working itself towards all week, most recently trading at $9,577 — almost $2,000 off its recently achieved high. Blankfein has no plans to start pursuing bitcoin, personally or professionally. “If it works out — and it gets more established, and it trades more like a store of value, and it doesn’t move up and down 20 percent, and there is liquidity to it — we’ll get to it.” But Blankfein doesn’t see that happening anytime soon. “When do I have to have a bitcoin strategy? Not today,” Blankfein stating, showing his lack of interest in the cryptocurrency. “Bitcoin is not for me. A lot of things that have not been for me in the past 20 years have worked out, but I am not guessing that this will work out,” he concluded. Featured Image: twitter",326.8099999999995,1

The assumption is that these files were created to steal user funds or information. Developers are urging those who downloaded the Windows wallet client during this time period to proceed with caution. Some have even suggested fully wiping any machines that downloaded the infected files, in order for users to protect themselves and their funds. “Anyone who downloaded the Windows Wallet file between November 21, 2017, 09:39 UTC, and November 25, 2017, 22:30 UTC, should not use the file in any way. If the file was used, the computer on which it was used should be addressed with extreme caution; the file should be deleted, the machine should be thoroughly checked for malware and viruses (or wiped clean), and any cryptocurrencies with wallets accessible on that machine should be moved to new wallet addresses immediately,” the team wrote. Numbers of those affected by the security breach and how many, if any, have subsequently lost funds have still yet to be determined. The Linux file was not affected by the breach, and the GitHub repository has now been secured to prevent any future breach from occurring.

Well, the Gibraltar Stock Exchange is now offering a brand new exchange: the Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange. Essentially, this is a new way for investors to join the steadily increasing cryptocurrency market. The best part is that Gibraltar already has the approval of European regulators, so it’s in the position to create quite the platform.  The aim is that is the platform will allow conventional investors to feel more comfortable. According to Gibraltar, the plan is to develop a safe place for investors who are too terrified of the idea of entering the unchartered waters of the digital currency market.  “Centered on the solid foundations of Gibraltar’s emerging regulations, the GBX seeks to become the world’s first nationally regulated digital asset marketplace and ecosystem, building towards a new era of certainty and stability for the world of Blockchain technology. Members of the Fintech community will find their home for a secure, supported and vibrant crypto community.” As mentioned, BlockShow Asia is ongoing, so it is important that you keep your eyes peeled so that you don’t miss any more announcements!

This, of course, differs from what Nobel Prize Winner Joseph Stiglitz had to say about the leading cryptocurrency.  The Bank of England Deputy Governor gave an interview to BBC Radio 5 Live in which he stated that Bitcoin was far too small to show any signs of a threat to the global economy. Cunliffe noted that it is important for investors to do a thorough analysis of the currency and the reasons behind its success in order to avoid risks.  “This is not at a size where it’s a macroeconomic risk to the global economy, but when prices are moving like that, my view would be investors need to do their homework. This is not a currency in the accepted sense. There’s no central bank that stands behind it. For me, it’s much more like a commodity.” Over the course of the past few weeks, Bitcoin has seen a number of novel price hikes.

Already, it is nearing the $10,000 mark, so it’s hardly surprising that so many people would be curious about the topic and interested in getting into the market through the use of a credit card. There are those who remain wary of the cryptocurrency surge, though. Ken Griffin, Citadel hedge manager, told CNBC that “these bubbles tend to end in tears,” while Mitchell Goldberg, head of ClientFirst Strategy, says “we’ve entered the final and stupidest part of the bull market.” Regardless of these warnings, the combined crypto market has reached a record $309.9 billion.

Essentially, the supply will come via new ways of trading Bitcoin, a digital currency, and from Bitcoin hard forks, which is a term used to describe a radical change to the protocol that makes previously invalid transactions/blocks valid. Back in the late 1990’s, there was a dot-com bubble, which is where this analysis comes from. If you were a company that had .com in your name during the dot-com bubble, then you would receive a major market increase. That said, the dot-com bubble came to an end after a large number of new .com initial public offerings took over the market. There was a time when the market absorbed them, but eventually, the market saw the problem and corrected it, which pulled the rug out from the majority of those businesses and like Darwin said, only the strongest survived. Perhaps one of the most important aspects of Bitcoin is its limited supply. If you were to ask anyone familiar with Bitcoin, they will tell you that only 21 mln Bitcoin will ever exist. So, the question that remains is: with such limited supply, how could an oversupply of the cryptocurrency occur? This is not a simple question to answer as it varies depending on how you look at it. To begin, Bitcoin hard forks are now developing new derivatives from the original currency. Take Bitcoin Cash for instance: this hard fork has caused a brand new Bitcoin with a market capitalization of $26 billion. According to the analysis, “…as the river of ways to invest in cryptocurrencies widens, the flood that has lifted the price of the Bitcoin will surely recede, and, as always, much faster than people expect.” Featured Image: twitter",235.36999999999898,1

The biggest unsolved mystery with the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value is who exactly Satoshi Nakamoto is. The white paper launched by the alias name was back in November of 2008, after the large housing/stock market crash.  No actual person or group since then has come forward and claimed the rights to inventing this idea and technology.  Recently, a software engineering intern at SpaceX by the name of Sahil Gupta wrote a post on the website, with the suspicion that Nakamoto is Tesla’s CEO and SpaceX’s founder, the one and only Elon Musk.  What kind of evidence does this intern have for this claim? Nothing definite but his logic is relatively fair. The original white paper written back in 2008 was by someone with “a deep understanding of economics and cryptography,” which Gupta knows that Musk has. He claims that Musk is an expert of the coding language C++, and that is the code Bitcoin was written in. Gupta discusses Mr. Musks’s drive towards his self-taught polymath that he built his rockets on for SpaceX and could have invented Bitcoin. Gupta goes on explain why Musk would have created Bitcoin back in 2008, saying: “It was 2008 (Great Recession), and he may have been motivated to solve the lack of trust in banks by creating a currency that doesn’t need them.” Back in 2014, a tweet was uncovered from Musk was in which he admits coyly that he is Satoshi.

BTC’s price is up 75.12 percent for the month.  Source: CoinMarketCap Just over two weeks ago, Bitcoin was in major trouble as it’s major upgrade SegWit2x was cancelled abruptly and the system’s “difficulty” protocol slowed the system down almost to a halt.  Miners jumped ship and began mining on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain as it became the more profitable option, causing things to flip nearly overnight. What saved the original blockchain, however, was the fact that Bitcoin Cash’s difficulty protocol caught up with it and the miners began mining the original blockchain once more. At its peak on November 12th, BCH reached a high of $2306.15 but now, at press time is trading at $1571.58. Despite its past issues with Bitcoin, it still reigns supreme when it comes to all the digital currencies on the market, with its market cap three times the size of the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum. It has seen its fair share of difficulties over the years but still has managed to rebound quickly and break record-after-record. Back in the middle of October, a Wall Street strategist by the name of Tom Lee predicted that Bitcoin would reach $25,000 by 2020. At the time, everyone thought he was crazy but now, it doesn’t seem that far off. As the Bitcoin’s developing team continues to work on SegWit2x, the block size limitations still remain.

Social media comments show that some investors think BTG is overvalued and that there are few apparent use cases. This makes the $400 gains speculative unless traders are otherwise anticipating use cases to appear in the future.

Max Keiser ‘s prediction last week of BTC eventually reaching $100,000 doesn’t seem so far off now, as its price begins to climb and top financial heads, have begun to jump on board.  Mikhail Mashchenko, EToro analyst, spoke to RT and states, “financial institutions could look to Bitcoin if major financial crash hits global markets.” He added: “The demand for Bitcoin is growing as the crypto market has become less volatile, and an increasing number of professional investors see it as insurance.” The stock market is currently in its second-longest bullish streak in history, currently at 104 months, Wall Street is gearing up for its inevitable shift. The longest streak in history was after the year 2000 where it made a 113-month run. If Maschenko’s predictions are correct, Bitcoin will have some sort of play in all of it. In the financial sector, it seems that there have been competing opinions on the cryptocurrency space. Just last week, JPMorgan announced that they will be offering Bitcoin futures set to launch in two weeks on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Many of the major European banks have been on opposite spectrums when it comes to supporting or bashing Bitcoin. What’s most exciting about this the current JPMorgan news is their CEO, Jamie Dimon, has been consistently in the news for slamming Bitcoin calling it a “fraud” but now his company, will be participating in the upcoming futures trades. When and if the stream of institutional investors start dipping their toes and invest large amounts of capital into cryptocurrencies a few of those predictions could be made true. Tom Lee, a 25 year Wall Street strategist, predicted back in August that Bitcoin would reach $6,000 by mid-2018 and in five years would reach $25,000. When a lot of regulations hit at the beginning of September, he held his ground on predictions despite being widely criticized. Lee’s prediction of $6,000 back in August now seems extremely conservative, whereas Mashchenko’s belief now is that Bitcoin will reach $10,000 by the end of 2017. “We could see a Bitcoin at $10,000 in a month or so. However, such a surge will be based on emotions, not on fundamental factors. So, further growth of the cryptocurrency will require something more than euphoria.”  Source: CoinMarketCap His predictions do not seem far off, seeing as Bitcoin has surged in price over $1,000 in just a couple of days. At press-time Bitcoin is trading at $9714.02 and up 3.78% for the day. At the rate of its current growth, Mashchenko prediction could happen within the current week.

As such, at those levels of electricity consumption, each individual Bitcoin transaction uses almost 300KWh of electricity- enough to boil around 36,000 kettles full of water. Although power consumption of other payment networks is harder to isolate, one of Visa’s two US data centers reportedly runs on about 2% of the power required by Bitcoin. Between them, those two datacenters conduct around 200m transactions a day; the Bitcoin network handless fewer than 350,000.  As the price of Bitcoin surges, so does the value of the reward, entailing that more miners put more computers to the task of running the network. But since the price of Bitcoin doesn’t necessarily rise in step with the number of transactions, that disconnect means the currency uses a significant amount of power per transaction in period of high prices.

The Big Bang Theory (BBT), will base its entire episode around Bitcoin as its cast will find a laptop full of the cryptocurrency. The BBT is currently airing its 11th season and is one of America’s most popular sitcoms. The show is centered around a group of friends who lean more on the ‘geeky’ genius side that reside in Pasadena, California. CBS’s top-rated show is infused with comic book collections, video games, and endless scientific humor.  Thursday’s show will be called “The Bitcoin Entanglement” and will expose millions of viewers to the world of cryptocurrency. For those familiar with the show, the BBT cast will find a laptop belonging to an ex of Penny’s that hold Bitcoins. The group is surprised that a single Bitcoin costs $5,000 USD and remembers that they “mined” some a while back. They all join in on a conversation as to how they would spend their Bitcoin money but decide to remove the show’s main character, Sheldon, from the investment split. Sheldon decides to mess with the gang, who discovers that the Bitcoin wallet is empty but Sheldon’s the only one that knows where these funds are stored. Bitcoin investors should be pretty enthusiastic to see their beloved cryptocurrency on a popular television sitcom showcasing the cryptocurrency, mining process and its wallets. BBT holds a current 8.3 rating on IMDb and should have close to 12.6 million viewers this coming Thursday.  Lately, Bitcoin has been debuted on other popular tv shows such as ABC’s Grey’s Anatomy. Airing two Thursday’s ago, a hacker held the tv’s show’s hospital system ransom, in exchange for 5,000 Bitcoin, which would be worth $200,000,000, as per the show. Bitcoin has also been previously mentioned on other popular TV shows such as Mr. Robot, The Simpsons, Jeopardy and the Good Wife. The BBT’s show was filmed a while back when Bitcoin’s price was around $5,000 per BTC but now it’s pushing almost double, at around $9,700 and has a $160B market cap. This week’s episode is certain to bring more users to inquire about the cryptocurrency market. Featured Image: twitter",465.630000000001,1

Yesterday, on November 26th, CNN noted that the price of Bitcoin saw a new all-time high at $9,060. Within 24 hours, the price of Bitcoin increased from $9,060 to $9,771, by nearly $700 overnight.  Since then, bitcoin price has stabilized in the $9,550 region. Short-term indicators such as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) reveal strong short-term momentum for Bitcoin.  Billionaire investor Mike Novogratz predict that Bitcoin price will surpass $10,000 this year.  The CME Group Bitcoin futures exchange launch is imposing a similar impact that the Bitcoin ETF had on the global Bitcoin market in March. The difference between the March Bitcoin ETF anticipation and the CME Group Bitcoin futures exchange hype is that the latter is guaranteed, given that another Bitcoin options exchange in LedgerX has already been approved and regulated by the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Further, the adoption of Bitcoin as a store of value and as a payment method is increasing at a rapid rate. In countries like Japan, major retailers and businesses like Bic Camera, Peach Airline, and Capsule hotels have already started to accept Bitcoin through strategic partnerships with cryptocurrency exchanges.  If Bitcoin’s current preference as a payment method continues to surge throughout 2018, its price will very likely reach the $10,000 mark. Featured Image: twitter",465.630000000001,1

Here’s a look at what sort of combative efforts they are making towards the cryptocurrency, and some reasons behind it. The High Council of Cyberspace (HCC) is the authority deciding on the entry of Bitcoin into the country, and so far, they have welcomed it, so long as it is controlled. HCC secretary Abolhassan Firouzabadi explains further, “We [at the HCC] welcome Bitcoin, but we must have regulations for Bitcoin and any other digital currency […] Our view regarding Bitcoin is positive, but it does not mean that we will not require regulations in this regard because following the rules is a must.” Bitcoin, in Iran, has been used as payment methods in both financial services and startup companies. Firouzabadi stated, “many in Iran are dealing with Bitcoin, be it purchasing, selling or mining it, and even dealing with it in exchange shops, creating content and establishing startups.” Due to this, the HCC, as well as the Central Bank of Iran, have begun to study cryptocurrencies to better understand the benefits and drawbacks of them. One of the main reasons behind Iran’s welcoming stance on cryptocurrency is a result from when, in 2012, Iranian banks were removed from the SWIFT payments network, subsequently removing Iran from the global banking system. This lasted four years. It’s possible that Iran is trying to get ahead of the curve on cryptocurrencies, and by regulating them, they hold better control.

The company’s CFO and operations lead Sarah Friar indicated that this move is about Square’s own innovation and not Bitcoin’s validation.  Square recently beat out Venmo as one of the most downloaded financial apps because of its usability. Its shares jumped over 4% when the news broke, as it signals Bitcoin trading for mainstream traders. The app has its limitations, however. Currently, users can not complete transactions in the cryptocurrency. Credit Suisse analysts also pointed out that Square is well positioned to allow cryptocurrency transactions at the point of sale. According to CNBC, the institutions recently elaborated its comments, adding that Square can add millions in annual revenue by supporting the cryptocurrency.  Credit Suisse estimates that Square can add 10 million bitcoin buyers over two years, which would drive its revenue up by $30 million. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© merznatalia",465.630000000001,1

He later had to take his laptop apart, and the hard drive containing the Bitcoins ended up in a drawer, which, three years later, ended up being cleared out and the hard drive was tossed. The 7,500 Bitcoins have gone from being worth $600,000 to $5 million to its current worth today of $72 million. The hard drive and its rich contents have long been lost in a Newport landfill, and there has been much speculation recently about whether or not it will ever be retrieved and what this retrieval could mean for Howells. The funds to dig through the landfill were too much for Howells, and he has since stated, “I’m at the point where it’s either laugh about it or cry about it. Why aren’t I out there with a shovel now? I think I’m just resigned to never being able to find it.” Other speculators looking to get their hands on the valuable hard drive won’t find the task so easy. Beyond the landfill being off-limits to the public, a Newport council spokesperson has said that if the hard drive were to be found, it would be returned to Howells as the rightful owner. If the hard drive does still exist and hasn’t deteriorated away within the landfill, then it will be the most expensive and sought-after piece of junk anyone will have ever seen.

Specifically, Bitcoin has risen $2,000 in the past few weeks and has indirectly given a 2% increase to companies like Nvidia and AMD. Why would a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin have any sort of effect on GPU manufacturers? Well, that has a lot to do with the form of the cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is online money, which means that to be involved with it in any way, you need to have access to a computer. From amateurs looking to get into mining to the more serious investor involved with cryptocurrency-related businesses, a graphics card is going to be bought in order to process it all. That means the more people getting into Bitcoin, the more graphics cards are required for them, the more money companies like Nvidia and AMD make. The rising stock in GPU manufacturers also comes from the recently announced upgrade to Ethereum’s Blockchain. The upgrade requires workers, who require GPUs, increasing demand for them further.  So long as cryptocurrency remains online, which is, at its core, the whole point of cryptocurrency, then GPUs will be needed to process everything cryptocurrency-related, and so, companies producing these valuable items will flourish.

Russia Today’s host, Max Keiser, just projected that one day Bitcoin will reach around $100,000. Bitcoin’s price hit a record high over the weekend, pushing past the $8,000 mark and defeated all cryptocurrency skepticism when it’s scheduled upgrade SegWit2x didn’t occur. On Monday and Tuesday of this week, Bitcoin was pushing the $8,400 mark breaking previous record highs.   Keiser’s belief is centered around Bitcoin’s ability to withstand multiple changes, proving it to be the most “dependable” and sturdy of the cryptocurrencies.  He said: “Bitcoin will dominate and lead crypto going forward. Hundreds of obituaries have been written about Bitcoin and none of them have come true and none will. Fact is, Bitcoin is a gift from God to help humanity sort out the mess it has made with its money.” While this new declaration from Keiser sheds a positive light on Bitcoin, it doesn’t change the fact that the network still needs room to grow. While the upgrade was postponed, for now, the issues it aimed at solving are not going away. The increasing amount of transaction on the original blockchain is putting a major strain on the network’s capacity and the accumulation of backlogged transactions makes Bitcoin’s blockchain burdensome while being used as a payment method.  Keiser believes that Bitcoin’s focus should be on its role as “digital gold” and leave the payments to other blockchains. He said:  “Dash is emerging as the crypto payment rail while Bitcoin asserts itself as Gold 2.0. I suggest those frustrated by the Bitcoin scaling debate to embrace Dash for payments and leave Bitcoin Core alone to continue working on Gold 2.0.” Many major investors appear to be responding positively to the story of Bitcoin being digital gold. There has been talk circulating about the potential of institutional investors bursting into the market with billion-dollar investments. It seems like the news about the upcoming launch of CME’s Bitcoin futures seems to be affecting the market positively.  Keiser’s forecast of Bitcoin doesn’t seem so far off now given the popularity it’s been getting in the mainstream market. He even went so much as to compare Bitcoin to Apple: “I remember when I bought Apple stock in the late 1990’s when it was valued for less than $100 million, Michael Dell publicly said that Apple should shut its doors and stop the embarrassment of being in business. Twenty years later, it’s approaching a $1 trillion market cap, and nobody talks about Michael Dell anymore.” Featured Image: twitter",-193.60999999999876,0

Their alternative investment fund illustrates the latest bid to attract investors to Bitcoin. The Financial Times reports that their fund has been approved by France’s financial regulator the Autorité des Marchés Financiers, was audited by PwC, and Caceis is going to be holding custody of the cryptocurrencies that are tied to the funds. Tobam’s President, Yves Choueifaty, said in a statement: “This first move in the world of cryptocurrencies showcases our dedication to remaining ahead of the curve and to provide our clients with innovative products in the context of efficient (i.e. unpredictable) markets.” The president also told the publication that they have “found some investors to launch the fund” and they have has “a lot of interest” when it comes to Bitcoin.  It is unsurprising that some investors want some exposure to the digital currency market, as Bitcoin has surged 5,000% against the dollar. There was now 55 dedicated cryptocurrency hedge funds and the CME Group is set to launch their bitcoin futures contracts next month.  It still is unknown if Tobam’s products will strike even more interest but with the most recent news and push towards the cryptocurrency it definitely seems that there will be.

These erased files contained the important programs the city uses for dispatching and planning the bus routes, along with their bus driver assignments.  It started on Saturday when the hackers took over the website and completely defaced it with a note stating, “I’m sorry to modify the home page, i’m good hacker, I just want to help you fix these vulnerabilities. This is one of the loopholes, modify the homepage.”  After the company was notified by residents, out of safety they took the entire website down, along with the credit card processing system.  The hacker then demanded a single Bitcoin, worth now over $8,000 USD, in order to stop the attacks and allow the IT team at SacRT to get the system back and running. Their exact note stated, “Hello, I will always attack your website, we are hackers. We can do everything. Pay us now to stop attacking.” They have not paid the ransom and are working diligently to get the system up and running. A representative told FoxNews that they back up their files “every day” and are restoring it via backup. The hack and ransom are extremely odd due to the size. By comparison, other hacks this year ranged from $250,000 to over $80 million. HBO and Equifax are the most notable companies that were hacked on a larger scale. It is still unclear as to why the ransom was so small, in comparison to the disruption it caused to the city of Sacramento.  Featured Image: twitter",-134.47999999999956,0

In the removed post from the company’s website, Tether blamed a “malicious action by an external attacker” for the heist. Tether, which was originally called Realcoin, is a platform that serves as a proxy for USD that can be sent between various exchanges. The company said it is moving quickly to make sure the exchanged money does not trade and reintroduced into the digital currency economy.   Tether wrote a statement saying: “$30,950,010 USDT was removed from the Tether Treasury wallet on Nov. 19, 2017 and sent to an unauthorized bitcoin address. As Tether is the issuer of the USDT managed asset, we will not redeem any of the stolen tokens, and we are in the process of attempting token recovery to prevent them from entering the broader ecosystem.” They are planning on releasing a new version of the software client Omni Core, which Tether runs on top of, to tie up the stolen currency. If all the nodes in the bitcoin network accept the new software, it would completely blacklist the stolen address and would trigger an emergency hard fork to hold the funds. Employees at Omni Core are hoping to release their new software in the days ahead, in hopes of retrieving the stolen Bitcoin.  Cryptocurrency investors took to twitter to voice their speculations on the entire situation, as it related to Tether and their level of control over their own software and the blockchain. In one particular thread, an investor said, “The level of control they exert over this blockchain is unusual, to the point where it could trigger regulation.” Following the announcement of the hack, other exchanges that grant order-book trading on Tether, like Huobi and OKCoin, immediately took steps and froze their trading.

At press time, Bitcoin has reached a record-high of trading at $8332.84. With the slump in the price reaching almost $6,500 last week, it left a lot of investors or those thinking of investing on the fence. However, the founder and chief investment officer of Morgan Creek Capital Management, which carries $3.7 billion in assets under its management, is still confident in the cryptocurrency and has predicted it will reach $400,000 in the long-run. Mark Yusko has been a senior investor for almost 25 years and invested in Bitcoin back in 2011. He regrets taking the “picks and shovels” method of investing and wishes he would’ve invested more. The Capital Management founder acknowledges why most financial higher-ups have such a negative reaction when it comes to bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies and believes the physical financial institution will one day become obsolete. Yukso states, “It is extremely natural to expect banks to be dismissive and skeptical because this is a disruptive technology. This will change the supply and demand equation for banking. It is that big. I’m not surprised at all that bankers, financiers and Saudi Princes are coming out against it. This is a truly disruptive technology.” He also added further to his statement of banks becoming obsolete, saying, “If you think about it why do we need a giant building to have a bank? We don’t.” In his eyes, money is digitized now. Yukso explains, “One of my greatest fears or nightmares is that I may wake up one morning and the bank says I have no money. How would I prove that I do? I don’t have physical records anymore, I don’t have a statement that says you have X dollars. So I think Bitcoin and blockchain and Ethereum too – are exciting new technologies.” The hedge fund manager compared the blockchain and bitcoin, to the internet thirty years ago. Noting that it has the complete capacity to “change everything” and that internet of money is real and just as crucial as the internet was in the 90s.

Nikiforov prompted that Bitcoin would remain completely outside of legality but the technology it’s founded upon, the blockchain, is “entirely possible.”  He said, “Bitcoin is a foreign project for using blockchain technology, the Russian law will never consider Bitcoin as a legal entity in the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation. However, I think that it is quite possible to use blockchain technology and the use of various digital tokens.”  The minister’s comments add even more to the confusion of Russian lawmakers stance on cryptocurrency. Many of their senior figures in the past have given off many different conflicting notions as to how Russia will act on this new cryptocurrency sensation. Early in October of this year, it was reported that the Russian ministry had submitted a document to the government enclosed with details of cryptocurrency adoption.  At that time, Nikiforov said, “We have submitted a draft decree regulating the legal adoption of cryptocurrency. That is why I think we should go ahead from the technological viewpoint, providing such instruments. It is hardly possible to get anything via restrictions amid digital economic development.”  Ultimately, the minister states the final decision is in the hands of the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Russia. However, some feel an outright ban of cryptocurrency across Russia is most likely inevitable. Featured Image: twitter",161.5699999999997,1

In a note to his clients Monday, he stated: “While we are positive on Square’s strategy, to the extent it confers legitimacy on Bitcoin and prompts adoption by other providers (i.e., PayPal) the biggest beneficiary may be the crypto-asset industry. We estimate that if Square can accumulate 10m bitcoin buyers over two years (tracking Coinbase’s growth), this could drive an incremental $30m in revenue” That figure stems from the belief that Square will charge a fee of 1.5 percent each transaction and on average, Condra estimates a customer would spend around $200 annually on bitcoin purchases. The Credit Suisse analyst echoed his neutral rating and increased his price target from $37 to $31. Following this report, Square’s shares closed at just under a 3 percent increase.

Why is this so important, you ask? The swap is monumental due to it being ‘off-chain’ which means the ownership of the coins switched hands but there was no recording of it on either blockchain.  These swaps are a form of a smart contract and allow a frictionless decentralized exchange of cryptocurrency between two compatible networks. This could be deemed as a solution for decentralized exchanges and could create “families” of coins that would allow different functionalities.  Charlie Lee, Litecoin’s founder, states: “Previous atomic swaps that I have done were on-chain, and had the on-chain limitations of slow [transactions] and high transaction fees. Off-chain atomic swaps are significantly better. They are instant, [have] low fees, and better protect one’s privacy.” This method would allow users to pass different cryptocurrencies to other people without having to wait for on-chain confirmations and would have substantially lower fees. This could deem as a simple solution for scalability for bitcoin, as well as produce much faster transactions.  Another benefit to these particular transactions is they are completely and fully anonymous, due to leaving no trace on either chain. They are entirely complete transactions but untraceable.

Source: CoinMarketCap.com   The crypto’s crazy weekend was the result of a cancellation announcement made on the morning of the 8th, in regards to the network upgrade, SegWit2x, that was set to launch November 16th. This upgrade was aimed at improving the transaction speed on the blockchain, that has slowed down a substantial amount over the years. If the upgrade took place, it would have been by way of a “hard fork” which would have resulted in miners mining the old blockchain resulting in a new bitcoin spin-off formed. The coin has already had two hard forks, earlier this year that was the result of the creation of Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold. Cash made headways this weekend towards their push to become the reigning cryptocurrency when miners started dumping Bitcoin’s blockchain and started mining Bitcoin Cash. The miners’ incentive to do this was the result of the difficulty protocol set on the blockchain network that made Bitcoin less profitable to mine and its off-shoot profitable. Eventually, Bitcoin Cash’s difficulty protocol ended up getting in the way when miners started flooding the system and ended up severely slowing down mining, which resulted in miners switching back to the original blockchain. The investor community has been slowly warming up to the idea of moving their money out of bonds and equities and into bitcoin. Projected for mid-December, the CME Group will be launching their bitcoin futures listing. As well as cryptocurrencies most popular wallet, CoinBase, announcing just yesterday that they are soon to launch a product for institutional clients. As the price of the cryptocurrency has shown in the last week, the market seems to be taking this news fairly well. Featured Image: twitter",-144.57999999999993,0

Vontobel and Leonteq Securities AG, Swiss asset management firms, will not allow their customers to bet against the price of Bitcoin. According to Reuters, Vontobel is launching these futures on the SIX Exchange today. This includes two mini-futures products, that only represent a fraction of the value of standard futures.  Eric Blattman, Head of Public Distribution of Financial Products, states their products have a goal to satisfy the urge of investors for more options, specifically cryptocurrency trading.  Blattman said, “We have seen big demand for our long tracker certificate from investors interested in playing the upside potential of Bitcoin and now they have also the possibility to hedge their position or go short.” As reported by Bloomberg yesterday, Leonteq Securities AG is working on a separate project that only has a two-month maturity. Manuel Durr, head of public solutions at Leonteq, stated: “the initial feedback has been extremely positive, clients do very much appreciate the possibility of choosing between a long or a short investment in bitcoin.” This big move in Switzerland is in the middle of growing interest in cryptocurrency among typical institutional investors.  In about a month, The U.S’s major CME Group is set to launch their new bitcoin futures. Also, a New York-based startup, LedgerX, has already begun offering cryptocurrency future trades and in their first week, $1 million was already traded.

According to a newly published survey from LendEDU, very high at $196,165 per bitcoin which is 30 times the currencies current market value. They conducted this survey earlier this month, with 564 Americans who have invested in Bitcoin. With the extremely small size of the group that was asked these questions, the findings should be read with reasonable caution.  Michael Brown, a Research Analyst with the Survey company LendEDU, had an interview with Fortune and confirmed the data results, “Believe it or not, that number and statement is true according to our polling data.” So, what would it take to actually reach that number? When the tech-savvy younger generation spends Bitcoin, in all their everyday transactions and it steadily replaces the national currencies. Current Bitcoin investors envision that it will potentially reach that price point with the help of time and the younger generation jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon. Once that occurs, the cryptocurrency world will draw in “older” investors who were not previously sold on the concept’s potential.  Brown continued:  “As it stands today, the price of cryptocurrencies is rising rapidly yet many of the most influential, older investors are still not sold on Bitcoin and believe it will collapse. Just imagine when younger Americans develop more spending power and attempt to bring Bitcoin into the forefront of the U.S. economy? At that point, the price of Bitcoin will skyrocket.” How long exactly would this take? Possibly, a whole era.  In order for Bitcoin’s price to rise 30 times what it currently is, a generational transfer of power would need to occur. Millennials are going to need some time to establish wealth and build their presence in the economy before Bitcoin can be brought fully mainstream.  Featured Image: twitter",548.4499999999998,1

At press-time, it is now selling at $1017.79, a 58 percent decrease from its high this Sunday.  Source: CoinMarketCap During BCH’s high its rival, the original cryptocurrency Bitcoin dipped below $6,000. It’s pretty clear that this highly anticipated “flippening” of the two cryptocurrencies, that some Bitcoin Cash enthusiasts predicated is now nowhere in sight. Although it had definite momentum, Bitcoin Cash’s own difficulty protocol is what halted this from actually happening.  Source: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin, as shown in the graph above, had a rollercoaster of a weekend in conjunction and connection with Bitcoin Cash’s rise. Bitcoin’s hash rate drastically fell this weekend close to 50 percent, as Bitcoin miners dropped mining Bitcoin and jumped over to Bitcoin Cash due to the monetary mining reward potentials. As mentioned earlier, Bitcoin Cash’s own difficulty protocol was its own demise, as it made Bitcoin Cashless profitable to mine and users switched back to mining Bitcoin.  At press time, Bitcoin has broken its own all-time high record from back on Nov. 8 and is now selling at $7756.28 and is up 7 percent.

Gorman states that despite it going up 700 percent this year the cryptocurrency is the definition of a “speculative investment and anyone thinking it might be stable is deluding themselves.”  Despite not sounding like a digital currency or bitcoin advocate, he did recognize the increasing adoption of it and its usability meant it was not going away “from one day to another.” Gorman goes on to describe Bitcoin as “not even close to a safe investment.” The CEO’s comments weren’t the most confident when it came to Bitcoin but it was a lot less harsh than other peers of his. JPMorgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, has had plenty to say on the world’s largest cryptocurrency and claims it to be a ‘fraud’ that will eventually blow up. The most notable comment he made recently was, “If you’re stupid enough to buy bitcoin, you’ll pay the price for it one day.” You can hear James Gorman’s full statements here.

He is directly tied to the obsolete BTC-e bitcoin exchange and is wanted by both the US and Russia for laundering Bitcoin.  His extradition hearing was set for today but was postponed because they are waiting for two witnesses to attend the hearing. It has been rescheduled for Dec. 6th. He is currently at the center of a judicial battle between the U.S and Russia, who is seeking his extradition on lesser charges. The U.S seeks to prosecute Mr. Vinnik for $4 Billion USD worth of laundered bitcoin through BTC-e, whereas Russia only accuses him of 667,000-ruble ($11,500) of fraud.  Athens courts have approved the extradition requests of both countries, but Vinnik is only appealing his extradition to the U.S. He is denying all charges on both sides but is not contesting being extradited to his home country. He has acknowledged working for BTC-e but strongly declares his innocence. Coincidentally, BTC-e has relaunched after their domain was confiscated by law enforcement and they deny any involvement with the suspect, Vinnik.   One of Vinnik’s lawyers, Alexandros Lykourezos, explains the reason for the postponement of the hearing by saying:  “We asked the court to postpone the hearing today of the U.S. request for the extradition of Vinnik so that two essential witnesses can come who couldn’t unfortunately come to Athens today. These witnesses will be able to testify and help the court understand the essential issues that arise from this case.” The suspect is being indicted by a grand jury in North District of California, as reported by the U.S Justice Department, and is facing charges of engaging in unlawful monetary transactions, money laundering, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. In the U.S these charges combined hold a maximum sentence of up to 20 years in federal prison. On December 6th Greece’s justice minister might have to make the final decision if Greece’s Supreme Court upholds the lower court’s order. Featured Image: twitter",680.7799999999997,1

This payment giant is letting a number of its users on its Square Cash app purchase Bitcoin. Square Cash, a main competitor of Venmo, allows its customers to send peer-to-peer payments and store money without the need to connect to a bank account.  Square has been making huge waves on Twitter, which I’m sure has made Jack Dorsey thrilled, as he is the CEO of both companies.  “First Square Cash. Then major banks,” one user wrote, via twitter.  Another wrote, “Bomb of the year: Buy Bitcoin with Square Cash. As easy as 123. Goodbye Coinbase.”  In an email statement sent Wednesday morning a Square Cash spokesperson states: “We’re always listening to our customers and we’ve found that they are interested in using the Cash App to buy Bitcoin. We’re exploring how Square can make this experience faster and easier, and have rolled out this feature to a small number of Cash App customers. We believe cryptocurrency can greatly impact the ability of individuals to participate in the global financial system and we’re excited to learn more here.”  Source: twitter Currently, the app only has the capabilities of letting its users buy, sell and hold Bitcoins but lacks the capability of making peer-to-peer payments with the cryptocurrency. Making payments to peers is the app’s primary use, and the company sees this as being the primary function to roll-out in the future.  Credit Suisse’s AG analyst Paul Condra had some positive things to say about the company. In a note to clients today,  he said, “Given Square’s tendency to move judiciously into new technologies, we expect it will do the same with bitcoin purchases. The upside could be significant if cryptocurrencies become more mainstream.” Both Bitcoin and Square have grown exponentially this year.

Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#charts Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, has had a monumental year as well, as its value has soared up 7 times what it was since January 1st. Bitcoin now sits at just over $7200 a coin. It has the highest market cap, $113 billion, among thousands of other cryptocurrencies, and it speculated to continue its bullish climb despite a few bumps throughout the year.  With both Square and Bitcoin having monumental years, it’s easy to see why Dorsey and the Square Cash team are making moves towards Bitcoin. The main users of his app are the younger generation and he said in a statement that he sees digital currency especially appealing to this generation. He also recalls someone once telling him that, “Gold is a stupid rock.”  Venmo is owned by Paypal and is Square Cash’s largest competitor. They are also in a great position to offer bitcoin services. However, the company has announced no moves in this direction yet. The New York Times Reported back in October that Square Cash had passed Venmo as being the most frequently downloaded financial app on both Apple and Android phones.  With how hot cryptocurrency has become this year, maybe their Bitcoin buying/selling offering will make the app that much more appealing. Featured Image: beat.10ztalk.com",680.7799999999997,1

Man Group’s CEO, Luke Ellis, told Reuters that his firm has plans of adding Bitcoin to their “investment universe” once CME’s futures contracts are approved and listed for trading.  The CEO stated: “Conceptually digital currencies are an interesting thing. It’s not part of our investment universe today – it could be. If there is a CME future on bitcoin, it would be.” Ellis believes that there are many hurdles cryptocurrencies still need to overcome to achieve mainstream adoption despite not having government backing, but he doesn’t believe that it currently makes them non-investable. He also told Reuters: “There is a big difference between a digital currency and a traditional currency…Traditional ones are supported by governments who have armies and tax men that can make people follow their rules, and digital ones don‘t,” he continued. “But that doesn’t invalidate digital currencies at all.” He did not state specifically if their firm will explore directly with the cryptocurrency markets or trade CME’s specific futures. Despite the uncertainty, this announcement is additional confirmation that mainstream investors are observing a way into the bitcoin environment. CME’s exchange is going to have “bumpers” to prevent the market from shifting too far one way, due to it being traded in the typical regulated environment. Trading can also be paused during times of high volatility. CME’s chairman, Leo Melamed, made a statement recently expressing his beliefs that using this framework will “tame bitcoin into a mainstream financial instrument.” Analysts are highly anticipating that after CME’s futures launch large figures of capital will flood in from Wall Street, minimizing Bitcoin’s volatility and aiding it in its maturity as an asset class.

Iris scans, fingerprint cards, and cards such as a passport are used currently as proof of identity.  Unfortunately, most of these biometric systems demand large amounts of infrastructure and are costly, while the cheaper alternatives are not as secure. However, one thing may change that; Blockhain Digital Identification. Canada is now welcoming a new cost-effective identification platform that is based solely on blockchain technology and gives Canadian citizens the opportunity to prove who they are in an instant, with 100 percent accuracy. Blockchain technology is the underlying structure of this completely definitive and cost reducing solution. Individuals would store all of their personal encrypted data and information on a personal phone.  When they would need to share their identity at, let’s say an airport, they would give their private key to this institution in order for them to access this information. They would access this information through the blockchain and it would be made available to this specific institution only.  This option gives consumers a simple solution if they don’t want their information stored in various databases, making it more accessible for hackers to obtain such data. SelfKey, a similar startup, is now offering very similar solutions for those outside of Canada and are launching their token sales soon. The shift of moving personal data onto individual storage devices would keep more data secure as these large hackers wouldn’t be able to obtain large chunks of personal information in just one sweep. The most recent Equifax hack wouldn’t have occurred because each person’s data would be safely stored on their own individual devices with their own private keys.

This may seem absurd for most of us living elsewhere to spend so much on one Bitcoin but Zimbabweans, however, the cryptocurrency offers a rare “safe haven” from its country’s inevitable financial implosion due to hyperinflation.  There have been reports that over the years, the inflation had driven its residents to carry entire backpacks in cash in order to pay for weekly groceries. Cash is now running short in banks as inflation rises and banks are now putting caps as to how much can be spent outside of the country.  As residents are losing value to their bank deposits by the day, they’ve turned to Bitcoin out of complete desperation. Zimbabwe’s president, Robert Mugabe, is urging its residents to take risks on the cryptocurrency, as its country is in a complete desperate state. Arnold Manhizwa, a 34-year-old father of two that works for an IT and Telecoms Company, told Reuters, “I have now changed all my reserves to bitcoin because that is the only way I can protect my investment. If I have $500 in the bank I won’t get it back and I will be losing value, but when I have my bitcoin it is going up every day.” The banks have begun halting and capping Visa and Mastercard bank transactions overseas, and with that Zimbabweans have found it extremely difficult to make payments internationally. Using Bitcoin bypasses the need to get foreign currency from the banks for payments and even makes it easier to buy goods from the growing merchants that now accept cryptocurrency.  The central bank is responsible for approving overseas transactions and they’ve stated that they currently have an estimated $500 million in pending foreign payments. They also prioritize payments such as fuel and medication, making the process even slower. Some upper class families that have sent their sons and daughters overseas for university are finding it extremely difficult to help fund them, with these pending transactions.   An analyst setting up a Bitcoin trading desk at a local bank brought up that it may seem attractive to move everything over to Bitcoin now, but states, “Once foreigners sell their bitcoin, they won’t have a way of getting their money out.” Featured Image: undispatch.com",74.27000000000044,1

Rumours spread in the past day – based on circulated document- revealing that the country’s State Grid was moving to ban bitcoin mining at a country level in the Sichuan province, an ostensibly notable development given the area’s abundant water supply for electricity generation and the fact that profit-chasing bitcoin miners are headquartered in the region. A translated document states that “bitcoin mining is an illegal activity. Each State Grid connected generator that is involved in powering Bitcoin mining is also regarded as an illegal practice, which shall prohibited.” The document was quickly circulated and reported by Chinese local media which raised questions about whether such a decision may signal an administrative move against bitcoin mining. According to Chinese business publication Caixin, local executives from the country branch confirmed the authenticity of the report but clarified it’s only an internal memo and some of the phrases were drafted incorrectly.

The new software that was initiated yesterday is specifically geared towards the rules of reward distribution and it was aimed at making it more attractive to the miner that secure this blockchain. Currently, the new version of the blockchain has assembled six blocks, while there has been zero mining on the older Bitcoin Cash network. Like any potential hard fork complication, with zero mining on the old blockchain they’ve successfully avoided a competing cryptocurrency being built. Yesterday’s hard fork switched a protocol to an alternative mining algorithm that will positively adjust how difficult it is for the miners to create new blocks on the blockchain, increasing it to every 600 seconds. The reason the BCH developers decided to initiate this, is a large number of miners have been switching frequently between mining Bitcoin and the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, shifting to whichever blockchain is offering the most rewards at that given time.  Many of the BCH supporters believe this is now going to “level” the playing field and should be fair without any miners gaming the system. What didn’t change with this network is their 8MB block size, that is what started this alternative cryptocurrency that was hard forked off the Bitcoin blockchain back in August.  The urgent need for this mining change had many developers believing this upgrade would run smoothly and without contention.  Earlier this week in various Bitcoin Cash specific cryptocurrency channels, major mining pool operators expressed their support for these upgrades. The mining algorithm had been producing wild fluctuations in hash rate and the upgrade aimed at fixing that. In the blog post specifically outlining this hard fork and its upgraded software, it detailed the current rule as “problematic because it prevents consistently fast confirmations for users, and radically shifts the coin issuance schedule.” Juan Garavaglia, a developer who coordinated the hard fork, wanted to stamp it as a success, indicating his optimism that all Bitcoin Cash networks will make the upgrade. If this new software upgrade lasts, it could mean great things for Bitcoin Cash.  The protocols have been strongly advocated as the planned hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain was suspended last week. Said hard fork, Segwit2x, was geared towards increasing bitcoin’s block size from 1MB to 2MB. With the suspended upgrade, Bitcoin supporters have been drifting to other alternatives. Starting its bullish climb Friday, Bitcoin Cash rose to a value of almost $2,500 Sunday, a record high.

The Bitcoin Cash rally was so substantial that on Sunday, it briefly surpassed the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, with its total market value at $29.9 billion. Bitcoin’s price at its lowest this weekend saw a 29% drop but the most concerning figure calculated was its hash rate which fell at close to 50 percent. A hash rate is the amount of computational power committed to mining each digital coin.  Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/ A steep and drawn-out drop in the Bitcoin hash rate has the capability of setting off a much-feared “chain death spiral” that could leave the bitcoin network entirely useless. This specific metric is vital for a coin like bitcoin, particularly when its reason for dropping is directly correlated with a competitor taking its spotlight.  Bitcoin Cash reached record-breaking highs at almost $2,400 and it also depleted a lot of hash power from Bitcoin simultaneously.   How exactly does this death spiral work? The current Bitcoin network adds a new bundle of transactions, known as a “block,” at a rough estimate of every 10 minutes, or so. This exact time is measured by how long it takes for a miner to process this block of transactions. This, in its proper sequence, is then set by something called the “difficulty” on the bitcoin network. The difficulty automatically adjusts itself to match the hash rate so that the transactions won’t take too long to process. The difficulty is only adjusting every two weeks. If the hash rate unexpectedly plummets this difficulty could be interpreted too high for the quantity of processing power of the network. If this occurs, it could mean major delays in the completion of Bitcoin transactions. Over the weekend, the spiral was mentioned throughout the cryptocurrency community with it on the edge of a disastrous failure. Said spiral starts when transactions are delayed and the network’s utility gets reduced. Its investors decide to stop “dumping” coins causing a sharp price drop. Miners, then begin mining other coins due to the network delay and the lower price of the cryptocurrency, which makes mining less profitable. The cycle would continue, with both miners and investors completely abandoning the coin, creating long delays in transactions times and preventing the “difficulty” adjustment from occurring to “break” the vicious cycle.  Peter Kim, a co-founder of a developer tool named Nitrous described the cycle as, “Transactions get backlogged to a point where the coin becomes basically useless.” Think that this scenario seems a bit far-fetched? Over the weekend, it came extremely close to happening. As everyone’s eyes were glued to the price of Bitcoin, they weren’t looking at the bigger picture.  Source: https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate Over a two day period, Bitcoin’s hash rate fell 50 percent as miners switched from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash because of the profit, as shown in the graph above. This drop indicated that the transaction times on the bitcoin network doubled, from 10 minutes to about 20 minutes or more.  A Bitcoin Analyst, Jimmy Song, explained why Bitcoin Cash suddenly became so attractive to miners. He said, “Bitcoin Cash was up to 100 percent more profitable to mine because of the price run-up. When it’s more profitable to mine Bitcoin Cash, miners will go there. When it’s more profitable to mine Bitcoin like right now, miners will go there.” Bitcoin Cash’s own mining difficulty increases ironically saved Bitcoin and halted the death spiral.  The algorithm governing its adjustments generated the rise in its difficulty, making Bitcoin Cash less profitable to mine.  Bitcoin Cash’s developers didn’t want volatile hash rates within their cryptocurrency, so they adjusted their difficulty adjustment rules on November 13th by way of a hard fork, but it was too late. By the time they initiated the upgrades, many of the miners had already switched back to bitcoin. According to fork.lol and the graph above, Bitcoin has gained about 20 percentage points from where it was at before the drop and the death spiral has been avoided.

The developers of “classic” claim Bitcoin Cash (BCH) will become new Bitcoin by May of 2018.  Tom Zander praised Bitcoin Cash in the statement claiming its validity meant that Bitcoin Classic “fulfilled its promise.” He also said, “It is now up to you which chain will gain the most traction. It is now up to the next billion people to start to use Bitcoin Cash. In at most six months I’m sure we’ll just drop the ‘Cash’ and call it ‘Bitcoin.’” At the time of reporting, Bitcoin Cash has shot up in price over 49 percent at $943.49, in the last 24 hours. This is its highest value since its debut back in mid-August.  Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/ Funds seem to be flowing into the Bitcoin rival, after the highly anticipated Bitcoin network upgrade, SegWit2x, was shut down on Wednesday. This sudden halt was due to the decline in support from its developing team and fear of a potential blockchain split, thus creating another Bitcoin rival. Zander had some words to say about the decision of Bitcoin to not go ahead with the upgrade stating, “The fact that the Legacy chain is stuck at 1 MB, and likely always will be, confirms the Cash chain’s viability. Now the market will decide.”  Before the news of this upcoming hard fork, Bitcoin Cash had been stagnant. Now, there is much support pouring in from public and investors, as its price has skyrocketed. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© spaxiax",-555.5899999999992,0
2017-11-10,7173.73,7312.0,6436.87,6618.14,5208249856.0,110354089394.0," Bitcoin’s investors are losing confidence as its price continues to drop past 5% at $6773.29 in just 24 hrs and its lowest, since November 1st. Traders have begun to bet on the coin’s ‘offshoot’, Bitcoin Cash, which split from its original version back in August. 
  Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/ Analysts say the surge is down due to developers pulling the plug on SegWit2x, a planned upgrade aimed at improving transaction speed on the network. The Director of the CFD Broker XTB, Joshua Raymond, told Business Insider: “The delay to Segwit2x has damaged confidence amongst bitcoin investors concerning the much-needed resolution to speed up bitcoin’s slow processing speed. Everyone was hoping the Segwit2x would address this but unfortunately, the delay due to a lack of consensus on the mechanics has affected confidence. Confidence in transaction speed in Bitcoin has deteriorated significantly in recent months. As Bitcoin Cash enjoys much faster transaction speeds, we have started to see a recycling of positions out of Bitcoin into Bitcoin Cash as a consequence.” Bitcoin Cash was initiated by way of a “fork” which splits the blockchain record, creating a completely new network. The incentive behind developers jumping ship to the new coin is that it allows for larger “blocks” to be processed, which makes the network much faster.  While the new SegWit2x upgrade had intentions of speeding up the original blockchain, many developers originally backed it and then began falling off close to its deadline. The hard fork also posed the risk of the network being split again, thus creating more competition. An Analyst from the trading platform eToro, said, “After the 2x hard fork was called off, BCH is now being seen as a favorite to one day replace BTC. If the community doesn’t come to a consensus about how to scale the network soon, it may run into congestion, in which case people will need an alternative.”  Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/#charts As developers scramble to come up with a reasonable solution to their slow network problem, Bitcoin Cash continues to rise. It seems some traders have jumped ship because, in just the last 24 hours alone, the off-shoot currency’s price has risen over 35% at $855.43. However, the original cryptocurrency has bounced back from adversity in the past, the digital currency’s price is up seven times what it was at the beginning of 2017. By the end of this year, the world’s largest futures exchange, CME, is launching Bitcoin futures, another positive step in the longevity of the cryptocurrency.

Yet, because of its transparent and its mathematical and decentralized character, calling it a bubble of any kind is highly inaccurate. Back in 2013, there was a Bitcoin bubble per se, when the demand for Bitcoin rose to a point where it could no longer be fully supported by the market and dropped from $1,300 to $200. Calling it a “bubble”, however, is still an inaccurate description, just like it’s inaccurate to describe Tesla and Amazon in the same way. Up until the end of this Spring, analysts continued to describe Tesla’s value increase as a bubble, as they did Amazon throughout its 20 years of business. The transportation editor of Business Insider a few months ago made a statement about Tesla saying, “At this point, a Tesla bubble looks obvious and it looks as obvious as it has since early this year. The difference now is that it’s grown so large that it’s become terrifying.” Any emerging company, startup, or technology that has an accelerated increase in their value or growth is now being seen by experts, as “bubbles.” With many major corrections from 2013 to 2017, Tesla’s price has increased from around $20 to $302. Since its beginning, Tesla has recovered from several setbacks and developed a stable sustainable business and, more importantly, a consumer base extremely similar to how Bitcoin evolved into a viable financial network and captured active user bases of tens of millions of people. Furthermore, Bitcoin has significantly matured since its launch in 2009. Apple’s co-founder and Billionaire Steve Wozniak recently described Bitcoin as more legitimate and transparent than “most systems in existence today.” In his interview with Money 2020 he stated: ”There is a certain finite amount of Bitcoin that can ever exist. Gold gets mined and mined and mined. Maybe there’s a finite amount of gold in the world, but Bitcoin is even more mathematical and regulated and nobody can change mathematics.” Featured Image: twitter",-555.5899999999992,0

The results were based on more than 2,000 adults participating, that were over the age of 18 during October of 2017. Bitcoin and the additional cryptocurrencies are perfectly suitable to the millennial mindset, as most are fed up with traditional banking and the dominion of old money and traditional investing. Investing in millennials has taken a shift toward digital currencies. It’s not just stocks that many millennials favor Bitcoin over, it’s other traditional financial assets as well. The survey question asked: Comparing Bitcoin to other forms of financial assets, would you prefer to own $1,000 worth of Bitcoin or $1,000 worth of (stocks, government bonds, real estate, gold)? Yes/No (Yes answers represented as percentages in the chart below)  Source: http://www.survey.blockchain.capital/ Nonetheless, the survey also showed that only 4% of this generation actually own or have owned bitcoin, while they prefer it over the traditional methods they are reluctant to pull the trigger. For the older generations who have always trusted in bonds and stocks, it’s easy to understand why their interest in the digital currency is smaller. As cryptocurrency is more widely adopted and becomes more mainstream, there will most likely be an interest shift. For most millennials ‘mainstream’ isn’t cool and that is most likely a big reason as to why Bitcoin is popular among the specific age group. While I’m sure it may seem mainstream for those in the cryptocurrency space, there is still a long way to go. Wall Street has started entering the digital currency world, with EFTs and futures starting to look more and more like a reality. The target audience will definitely be the younger generation but with their hand in it, interest might spread across the various generations. Featured Image: forbes",-303.25,0

The upgrade, named SegWit2x, was aimed at increasing block size. Early on there was strong support for the from Bitcoin startups and mining pools. The upgrade was anticipated to happen on November 16th and occurring on block 494,784. 2x’s goal was to increase bitcoin’s transaction capacity, which is currently held back by the nature of the current software’s rules. This halt in the upgrade was announced to the public today via email from BitGo’s CEO Mike Belshe. He was one of the main leaders of the Segwit2x project. He wrote: “Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean block size upgrade at this time. Continuing on the current path could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin’s growth. This was never the goal of Segwit2x. Until then, we are suspending our plans for the upcoming 2MB upgrade.” Due to this halt, the price of Bitcoin hit another record high of $7,848.31 according to CoinDesk. Although, by the afternoon it hit a session low of $7,078.96.  Source: Coindesk.com As fees continue to rise in Bitcoin Transactions, the developers are hoping the community can come together for a solution to this problem.

But do you know why this digital currency is garnering national attention? It’s because bitcoin is a huge deal. Some have even gone as far as calling it ‘gold 2.0’.  And why shouldn’t they? Bitcoin is one of the biggest trends our generation has ever seen. It’s certainly one of the most important inventions since the internet.   Don’t believe me? Just ask Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, or Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group.  Branson has said that there is a massive industry surrounding the digital currency, and “people have made fortunes out of bitcoin.”  Gates believes bitcoin is exciting because it shows just how cheap it can be. “Bitcoin is better than currency because you don’t have to physically be in the same place.” What does Gates mean when he says one doesn’t have to be in the same place? Well, here’s where things really start to get interesting: There is no such thing as a bitcoin company or building. In fact, there isn’t even a bitcoin server to shut down even if one wanted too. Bitcoin is completely distributed and that’s what makes it so unique.  It’s a way to exchange value online without a third-party intermediary. While it’s true bitcoin might endure a few ups and downs – like any other emerging technology – bitcoin still appears to be here to stay. In fact, there are a few who believe that one bitcoin could be worth between half a million dollars and a million dollars in 10 years time. So, the question that remains is: is bitcoin the currency of the future? It certainly seems that way. Some have even suggested that the black chain encryption behind bitcoin has the ability to bring the world out of poverty. So what are you waiting for? Get out there and do some research; build yourself a bitcoin wallet and learn about all the ways in which this is going to improve the lives of people on this planet because bitcoin truly is one of the most important inventions of humankind.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value has seen a steady bull trend since Wednesday when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world’s largest derivatives trading house by volume, announced that they will launch trading for Bitcoin futures, before the end of this year. Analysts believe more institutional investors could potentially warm up to the digital token after Wednesday’s announcement.  Charles Hayter, Ceo of Crypto Compare told CNBC in an email: “This is bitcoin crossing the divide from the wild west of finance to the mainstream. Futures from an incumbent exchange bring bitcoin and cryptocurrencies into the regulatory fold. This allows more complex financial products to be created and will eventually open the doors to institutional money.” This skyrocketed movement following CME’s press release also saw the total value of all of all cryptocurrencies climb to over $200 billion, a new record high. The market cap of Bitcoin, being the most valued cryptocurrency by a wide margin, takes up most of the overall value sitting just at $124 billion. The price of Bitcoin has risen 640 percent since the beginning of 2017.  CNBC reported on Wednesday of this week that Amazon, the e-commerce giant, secured three new domain names in relation to cryptocurrency. The three new domain names they bought were: amazonethereum.com, amazoncryptocurrency.com, and amazoncryptocurrencies.com. Amazon already owned the domain name of amazonbitcoin.com but the VP of Amazon Pay, Patrick Gauthier, told CNBC when they inquired about this very thing last month, that Amazon has no plans on accepting cryptocurrency, as there is not any current demand. As for the buying of the domain names currently, it’s likely due to them just securing the sites to protect their brand name as cryptocurrency continues to grow. On many occasions companies buy various domains surrounded by their name to secure their brand. However, with how competitive Amazon has become on crushing their opponents, their shift into the cryptocurrency space is inevitable. Bitcoin has a higher market cap than major companies like Nike and American Express. As more and more businesses start accepting Bitcoin as well as other digital currencies, their hand will be forced in order to keep their monstrous market share intact. Bitcoin is being faced with another hard “fork” in its blockchain scheduled to occur later this month. Currently, its investors and miners, volunteers who process the transactions and add them to the blockchain, are currently split on the movement of the asset. The mining of the Bitcoin blockchain is a long procedure and a group of developers is brainstorming ways to speed up the mining process. Bitcoin has already endured two forks earlier this year, and new cryptocurrencies emerged because of them. Bitcoin Cash was created in August and just last month, another hard fork created Bitcoin Gold. There have been a number of critics recently that have expressed their doubts on cryptocurrency. On Thursday during a press conference, the New York Times reported that Tidjane Thiam, the CEO of Credit Suisse, stated that bitcoin was the “very definition of a bubble.” Credit Suisse, happens to be the second largest bank in Switzerland. In a note this morning, Oliver White, an economist at Fathom Financial Consulting, stated that as an asset, Bitcoin was “intrinsically worthless.” “Bitcoin fans will doubtless argue that it’s no different from fiat money in this respect. But that’s to do a disservice to notes and coin, in our view. Notes and coin have government backing,” White states. On the other hand, Business Insider released a video on October 19th interviewing one of Wall Street’s top strategist on his predictions of Bitcoin.  Tom Lee, Co-Founder of FundStrat Global Advisor, described in this interview his different methodologies in valuing Bitcoin. Lee has over 25 years experience in Wall Street equity research and every year since 1998, has been top-ranked by Institutional Investor. He projected Bitcoin’s value by the middle of 2018 to reach $6,000 but due to recent events, it has far surpassed his projected numbers. His long-term projection was bitcoin would reach $25,000 by 2020. You can view the full interview below:  Featured Image: depositphotos/spaxiax",120.23000000000047,1

The New York Times reports that the banking chief called Bitcoin’s anonymity a major “challenge” before saying, “From what we can identify, the only reason today to buy or sell Bitcoin is to make money, which is the very definition of speculation and the very definition of a bubble.” Bitcoin reached a record high of $7,000, which happens to be seven times its value from the beginning of 2017. Other big bankers have similar views to Thiam’s, JPMorgan Chase & Co’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, recently called Bitcoin a “fraud” that will eventually implode. Of the most notable to comment on this “bubble” theory was the one and only billionaire investor Warren Buffett.  Criminal use of the cryptocurrency and their belief of criminals being able to hide their activities with its anonymity, is another big potential drawback bankers see from the cryptocurrency and its blockchain.  Thiam said, “Most banks in the current state of regulation have little or no appetite to get involved in a currency which has such anti-money laundering challenges,” Bitcoin’s new high has been all over the news, Thiam adds that he still expects interest in the world’s largest cryptocurrency to subside. Still, while bitcoin is being stiff-armed by most banking officials, banks are in a race to develop and implement blockchain technology in their systems. Featured Image: twitter",300.72999999999956,1

This sudden interest in the cryptocurrency could have contributed to its recent rallies. This was what Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:$CTXS) CEO, Kirill Tatarinov said on Monday in response to TheStreet’s founder, Jim Cramer’s question at a panel discussing cybersecurity concerns at The Deal’s 2017 corporate governance conference. The issue at hand here are the ransomware attacks, and how various companies deal with such difficult situations. Ransomware is the act of cyber criminals hacking into a company sensitive information, and then demanding payment in Bitcoins to not destroy company data or networks. The WannaCry outbreak was such a case that cornered many companies, possibly fuelling the surge in Bitcoin value. It’s good to note that cyber criminals prefer payment in Bitcoins due to the untraceable and anonymous aspect of the currency. “We’ve seen people pay up after ransomware attacks,” said Tatarinov in an interview. “We’ve seen people who are proactively bulking up on bitcoin anticipating those attacks. We’ve seen companies proactively, we saw a couple examples in the U.K., where companies are proactively building up their Bitcoin to excesses so they can pay up. This is happening.” With over 400,000 companies, the twenty-eight-year old company that is Citrix Systems is a cloud service that provides secure digital workspaces, much like a very secure google drive, allowing users to securely access their work information from any device. The Ransomware attacks that made its rounds last month was supposedly the results of a weakness in the Windows operating system that was allegedly discovered by the U.S. National Security Agency. The information of the Windows weakness was posted by a group known as the “Shadow Brokers”. As such, with fear of a WannaCry repeat driving purchases by various U.K firms, consistent stockpiling may have something to do with Bitcoin’s surge in value from $1,692 on May 12, to its peaks of $2785 in June.  Although the value of Bitcoin has thought to have been derived from pure speculation, the reality that firms are stockpiling Bitcoin in order to pay off cyber criminals has suggested a legion of buyers that use Bitcoin for practical purposes. “Now I know why bitcoin went up so much,” – Jim Cramer, Founder of TheStreet Featured Image: depositphotos/merznatalia",172.35999999999967,1
