Currently we have a dataset with 317 data points. Each data point contains the news title and the cryptocurrency price change for the day (0 or dump 1 for pump). We don’t have a big enough dataset yet. So currently we only have a training set (80%) and a test set (20%) without the validation set. 

In order to use this dataset with machine learning, we made a nice machine learning software named “Machine Learning with Text Data” (https://github.com/edgeslab/cs418-project-slamming-squad-1/tree/master/ML_TEXT ). It has a GUI built using PyQt5 and handles most major machine learning classifiers (SVM, Neural Network, kNN, etc.) Hyperparameters can be tuned inside the software. Its core function uses all techniques we learned in the class and homework about text data handling. It is tested with the tweets train data in our homework. 

We feed our dataset to the software. We tried several types of classifiers and tuned some hyperparameters. We don’t want to use the test set too many times. So, we didn’t try all hyperparameters to avoid overfitting. Currently the best result we get is using polynomial SVM, which gives us 10-Fold Cross validation score of 0.597, and the test score is 0.703. Considering the data set is relatively small, this is a promising result. In the future, we will extend the size of our dataset, and also use each news content instead of title. We expect even better test score. 

The software will have function build-in to predict the price changing trend by feeding one(or more) news data. By then we will have the complete train-evaluate-test-predict machine learning process.
