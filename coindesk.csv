" Bitcoin (BTC) continues to gain altitude in line with the recent bullish developments on the technical charts and could soon rise above the psychological resistance of $6,000. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization crossed key resistance at $5,780 earlier today to print a high of $5,970 on Bitstamp – a level last seen on Nov. 14. Bullish sentiment is evidently strong, as evidenced by bitcoin’s quick recovery from the break below the former resistance-turned-support of $5,627 (April 23 high) on Monday. As a result, the cryptocurrency looks set to break above $6,000, as suggested by April’s bullish close above the crucial 21-month exponential moving average (EMA). As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $5,920 on Bitstamp, representing a 43 percent rise from the low of $4,120 seen on April 2. The rally, confirming a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change in the weeks, comes in the lead up to Blockchain Week NYC and CoinDesk’s Consensus 2019 event, which is set to take place May 13–15 at the New York Hilton Midtown. The cryptocurrency may remain better bid post the event, as seen in some years previously. Back in 2017, BTC rose from $1,233 to $1,207 following the conclusion of Consensus on May 24. Further, prices also rallied 21 percent and 3 percent in one month following the blockchain week in September 2015 and May 2016, respectively. In last year’s bear market, however, prices dropped from $8,700 to $5,780 in five weeks following the blockchain and crypto gathering in mid-May, indicating that broader market sentiment is the greater driving factor.  BTC is trading well above the crucial resistance of $5,780 (June 2018 low) on the daily chart (above left). It’s worth noting that the cryptocurrency has failed three times in the last four trading days to secure a UTC close above that level. The focus, therefore, is on the UTC close. The case for a sustained rise to $6,200 and above would strengthen if the price closes today above $5,780. However, a pullback to $5,000 could be seen in the short-term if we see a UTC close below $5,686 (daily opening price), leaving a candle with a long upper shadow in its wake – an early sign of bearish reversal. A bullish close looks the more likely if we take into account a diamond breakout seen in the 4-hour chart (above right), indicating the rally from the April 25 low of $4,991 has resumed and the next major resistance band of $6,100–$6,200 could soon come into play. That said, a move above $6,000 could be short-lived or remain elusive, with the long duration chart below questioning the sustainability of the recent gains.  On the 3-day chart, volume bars have consistently printed lower highs, contradicting the higher lows and higher highs on price. Further, trading volume (red arrows) on red candles (drop in prices) has been bigger than the volume on green candles (uptick in the price), which could be considered a sign of weakening buying pressure. Validating that argument is the bearish divergence of the Chaikin money flow index, which is yet to challenge the high of 0.231 seen on April 2, despite prices being at near 6-month highs. The Chaikin money flow index measures the money flow volume over a set period of time (usually 21 days) to gauge buying and selling pressure.

" Bitcoin (BTC) could be in for a price pullback, having faced rejection at key price hurdle for three consecutive days. The cryptocurrency market leader jumped above the April 23 high of $5,627 on Friday, bolstering both the short- and long-term technical setups. However, despite the odds stacked in favor of a quick rally toward $6,000, the cryptocurrency failed to find acceptance above the June 2018 bottom of $5,780 over the weekend, according to Bitstamp data. For instance, BTC clocked highs of $5,796 and $5,846 on Friday and Saturday, respectively, but closed below $5,780 on both days. Similar price action unfolded on Sunday, with BTC hitting a high of $5,782 before ending the day at $5,709. It is worth noting that $5,780 was expected to offer stiff resistance. The level is important because BTC’s sell-off from May 2018 highs near $10,000 run out of steam at $5,780 on June 24. Subsequently, a bounce from that level was followed by an over 40 percent price rise to $8,500 by July 24. Bitcoin’s recent failures to cross that threshold suggest a pullback and a bounce from the historically strong support level may be needed to recharge the engines for a sustained rise to $6,000. The case for a price pullback would further strengthen if President Trump’s re-escalation of US-China trade tensions and the resulting slide in equities ends up sending gold higher. This is because the inverse relationship between BTC and gold has recently been its strongest in over 12 months. So far, however, gold has barely benefited from the flight to safety. The safe haven asset is currently trading at $1,283 per ounce, representing a mere 0.17 percent gain on the day. That’s opposed to futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is down close to 500 points at press time. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $$5,617 on Bitstamp – a 1.48 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  BTC is currently reporting losses below the former resistance-turned-support of $5,627 (April 23 high), having failed to close (UTC) above the June 2018 bottom of $5,780 for the third straight day on Sunday. The relative strength index (RSI), which had invalidated a bearish divergence with a move above the falling trendline on Friday, has ended up creating another bearish lower high as opposed to higher high on price. As a result, a pullback to the historically strong 30-day moving average (MA) support, currently at $5,294, cannot be ruled out.  BTC seems to be creating a double-top pattern with a neckline at $5,510 on the 4-hour chart. A break below that level would create room for a drop to levels below $5,200 (target as per the measured move method). A drop below $5,510 may happen in the next 24 hours or so, as the repeated failure to find acceptance above $5,870 has been accompanied by the bearish divergence on the RSI.  Bitcoin closed last week above the 50-week moving average (MA), further strengthening the evidence for a long-term bullish reversal. The weekly chart RSI is also biased bullish, having convincingly scaled the resistance band of 53.00–55.00 last month. The 5- and 10-week MAs are trending north, also indicating a bullish setup. Notably, both MAs are located at $5,386, so that level could work as strong support this week. With the long-term chart looking bullish, a pullback to the 30-day MA or lower could be short-lived. A strong bounce from that average would likely yield a rally to $6,000. That said, the prospects of a deeper slide below $5,000 would improve if prices see back-to-back daily closes below the 30-day MA.

" With gold on the defensive and down roughly 6 percent since mid-February, bitcoin may continue to shine brightly in the near future. After all, experts have found the two assets to be inversely correlated. The 90-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin and gold – a statistical measure of linear interdependence between the two variables – is currently seen at -0.71, the lowest level since March 20. A negative number represents an inverse relationship, i.e. meaning the two variables are moving in opposite directions, which has been the case between bitcoin and gold since November.  For instance, the yellow metal found takers at $1,200 on November 13 and was flirting with the psychological resistance of $1,300 at the end of December. During the same period, bitcoin, fell from $6,200 to $3,122, according to Bitstamp data.  It is worth noting that correlation does not imply causation. When a strong correlation develops between the two variables, it does not necessarily mean that one is causing or influencing the other.  The gold rally witnessed in November-December could be associated with the broad-based US dollar weakness triggered by speculation that the Federal Reserve will pause interest rate hikes in 2019. Bitcoin, however, did not benefit from the same dollar sell-off and tanked to 15-month lows near $3,100. The negative correlation had weakened somewhat in the first quarter with bitcoin recovering to $4,000 by February end amid an extended gold price rally to a February 20 high of $1,346.  By February’s end, however, the gold market completed pricing in the Fed rate hike pause, which the central bank confirmed in March, opening doors for the “sell the news” move in the yellow metal. Gold ended March below $1,300 and has remained on the back foot ever since. As of this writing, it is trading at $1,270 per ounce, representing a 5.6 percent drop from February highs.  Interestingly, bitcoin surged past key resistance at $4,236 on April 2 – two days after gold found acceptance below $1,300 – and jumped to a five-month of high $5,622, according to CoinDesk price data. This revived the strong inverse correlation with the precious metal.  With gold looking increasingly weak, there is reason to believe that the cryptocurrency market leader may extend its ongoing rally past the psychological resistance of $6,000.  From a technical perspective, gold is indeed developing a bearish market structure referred to as the “head and shoulders” reversal pattern, which suggests more downside is likely in the near future.  The pattern generally appears as three consecutive troughs, the middle of which being the tallest, essentially depicts the failure of a trend to maintain its bullish streak of successive higher price highs.  Gold broke down from the pattern on April 16, confirmed by its price finding acceptance below the pattern’s neckline, with its scope now set for the 200-day moving average currently located at $1252. Support will need to be provided in order to avoid further depreciation. That said, we can create a measured breakdown of this pattern by subtracting the size of the head from the breakdown point, which suggests more downside is possible toward $1220.  Again, correlation is not causation, but gold’s near-term bearish outlook may be a sign of positive things to come for bitcoin’s direction. Gold image via Shutterstock",2019-05-03
" Bitcoin’s (BTC) price hit 5.5-month highs above $5,700 soon before press time, bolstering both short- and long-term bullish views. The cryptocurrency market leader rose to $5,714 at 08:340 UTC, the highest level since Nov. 18, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. BTC was last seen trading at $5,682, representing a 5.6 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. The rally to 5.5-month highs has strengthened the bullish case put forward by the cryptocurrency’s recent bounce from the crucial 30-day moving average (MA) after a drop when the recent Bitfinex controversy hit the news. Further, it validates April’s bullish close above the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month exponential moving average of the price. Last but not the least, with the recent bounce from levels below $5,000, the cryptocurrency has invalidated a strong bearish indicator pattern, as seen in the chart below. As a result, prices could rise to $6,000 over the next few days.  As seen above (prices via Bitstamp), the 30-day MA has lived up to its reputation of being strong support by reversing the price pullback from highs above $5,600 to $5,000. More importantly, with the bounce, the relative strength index (RSI) seems to have found acceptance above the descending trendline, representing a bearish divergence confirmed on April 24. In the past, BTC has suffered significant price pullbacks following the confirmation of the bearish divergence of the RSI. This time, however, the pattern failed – a sign of strong bullish sentiment. What’s more, the Chaikin money flow index, used to measure the money flow volume over a set period of time (usually 21 days), has risen from 0.0036 to 0.12 in the last few days, confirming the uptrend in price. So, BTC could close well above the April 23 high of $5,627 today, further strengthening the case for a rally to $6,000. On the way higher, BTC may encounter resistance at $5,780 (June 2018 bottom) and $5,880 (August 2018 bottom), as discussed yesterday.  Bitcoin has breached the 50-week MA resistance, currently at $5,418, on the weekly chart. However, confirmation of the breakout is needed in the form of a close above $5,418 on Sunday (UTC). The case for a pullback to levels below $5,000 would strengthen if the buyers fail to keep prices above the key average for the second week.

" Bitcoin (BTC) is on the offensive, having defended key support, but a rally to $6,000 faces a number of resistance hurdles lined up in the $5,400–$5,900 range. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell more than 5 percent to $5,000 on April 25 after the New York Attorney General’s office alleged that Bitfinex had lost $850 million and used a secret loan from affiliated firm Tether to hide the loss. The price pullback, however, was short-lived. BTC again bounced up from the crucial 30-day moving average (MA) resistance on April 30 and is currently trading at $5,350 on Bitstamp. Additionally, BTC closed last month above the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month exponential moving averages (EMA), solidifying the long-term bullish breakout, as discussed yesterday. As a result, a consensus seems to have built in the market place that BTC will likely see a quick rise to $6,000 in the short-term. While the outlook is indeed bullish, a sharp rally to $6,000 may not be so smooth with the following levels possibly offering stiff resistance.  BTC is again closing on the (bearish) 50-week moving average (MA), currently at $5,414, which proved a tough nut to crack last week. At the time, prices had risen to a five-month high of $5,627, but they ended the week well below the 50-week MA. Bitcoin’s failure to hold onto gains isn’t surprising as the average is still trending south, indicating a bearish setup. It is often observed that averages serve as resistance if they are biased bearish (sloping downwards). A sustained breakout is more often seen once the average begins to flatten out. It’s worth noting that rejection at the 50-week MA in July and August 2015 almost ended up killing the nascent bull market, as discussed last week. Another failure to close above the 50-week MA could trigger profit taking, leading a deeper drop below $5,000.  Bitcoin could face stiff resistance at $5,780, the level at which BTC’s sell-off from May 2018 highs near $10,000 bottomed out at the end of June. A bounce from $5,780 was followed by a more than 40 percent rally to $8,500 by July 24, further highlighting the importance of the price level. As a result, the former support could now act as a stiff resistance, more so, as the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from the November highs to December lows – one of the widely-tracked Fibonacci ratios – is located at nearby at $5,811.  Again, $5,880 is a former support-turned-resistance. It marks the low of the long-tailed candle created on Aug. 14, 2018, that aborted the sell-off from July highs. Similarly, the candle ended up fueling a significant price bounce to $7,411 (Sept. 4 high). So, it seems safe to say that the road to $6,000 is packed with stiff resistance levels. Traders should watch out for signs of bullish exhaustion (candlestick patterns like doji, bearish engulfing, etc.) near the key hurdles, which could mark price pullbacks. As for the next 24-hours, the focus remains on the 30-day moving average (MA), currently $5,199.  The chart shows (above left), the latest bounce from the 30-day MA is accompanied by falling volumes. Further, the hourly chart (right) is showing a bearish divergence of the Chaikin money flow indicator. As a result, a fall back to $5,199 (30-day MA) looks likely. A close below that level would put the focus back on the bearish divergence of the relative strength index, confirmed last week. In that case, BTC would likely drop below $5,030, confirming a head-and-shoulders bearish reversal pattern and slide toward the 50-day MA, currently at $4,736. The head-and-shoulders breakdown, however, would remain elusive if prices break above $5,466 (April 10 high), validating the recent bounce from the 30-day MA. In that case, April’s high of $5,627 could come into play. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin (BTC) scaled an important price resistance with double-digit gains in April, solidifying the long-term bull breakout witnessed four-weeks ago. The crypto market leader closed (UTC) at $5,269 on Tuesday, representing a 28 percent gain on the April 1 opening price of $4,092, as per Bitstamp data. That’s the biggest monthly gain since April 2018, as discussed yesterday. Importantly, April’s close put prices above the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $5,248. That EMA had emerged as a strong price floor in the five months to October 2018, forcing many to conclude that the bear market had ended near $6,000. Bitcoin, however, dived below $6,000 on Nov. 14 – falling to lows near $3,100 by mid-December – and, with that, the 21-month EMA became the level to beat for the bulls. Now that BTC has secured a monthly close above that key hurdle, the long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change confirmed on April 2 looks more credible. As a result, a rally to $6,000 in the next few weeks cannot be ruled out. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $5,300 on Bitstamp – up 2.4 percent on a 24-hour basis. As seen on above left, April’s candle closed just above the 21-month EMA, the first monthly close above the key average since October 2018. The bullish close comes four weeks after bitcoin first confirmed long-term bullish reversal by violating the most basic of all bearish patterns – the lower highs and lower lows – with a high-volume break above $4,236 on April 2. The chart also shows a falling channel breakout, which indicates a bearish-to-bullish trend change. It is worth noting that a similar bearish channel breakout in October 2015 was followed by a 2.5-year bull market (see above right). Essentially, BTC has activated twin bullish cues – a falling channel breakout and a close above the 21-month EMA – with April’s close at $5,269. These developments are remarkably similar to the ones seen in October 2015.  The above chart shows bitcoin has again bounced up from the 30-day moving average (MA), weakening the case for a deeper pullback put forward by the bearish divergence on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI). It is worth noting that BTC has suffered significant price pullbacks following the confirmation of the bearish RSI divergence in the past. This time, however, the pattern seems to have failed, with the price bouncing up from the 30-day MA, a sign of strong bullish sentiment. As a result, BTC could revisit and possibly breach the recent high of $5,627 reached on April 23. The case for a temporary pullback to the 50-day MA, currently at $4,706 would strengthen if and when the price closes below the 30-day MA at $5,184.

" Bitcoin (BTC) is on track to confirm a long-term bullish reversal with a first three-month winning streak for over a year. The crypto market leader is currently trading at $5,166, representing a 26.58 percent gain on the monthly opening price of $4,081, having gained 9.8 and 8.16 percent in February and March, respectively, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). That is the first three-month run of gains since the last quarter of 2017. Back then, the cryptocurrency appreciated by 48, 54 and 39 percent in October, November and December, respectively. !function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var e in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+e)||document.querySelector(""iframe[src*='""+e+""']"");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][e]+""px"")}})}();  April gains would have been in excess of 35 percent had the cryptocurrency managed to hold on to five-month highs above $5,600 hit on April 23. Nevertheless, BTC has achieved a feat last seen at the height of the bull market in the final months of 2017 and has extended its three-year April winning run. More importantly, with the solid double-digit monthly gain, the cryptocurrency has violated a long-term bearish channel, confirming a bull breakout. A similar pattern seen in October 2015 paved way for a 2.5-year long bull market.  As seen above (left), BTC topped out at the then-record high of $1,163 in November 2013 and fell into a bear market in February 2014, (prices via Bitstamp). In the following months, the cryptocurrency established a falling channel – bearish lower highs and lower lows – which was breached to the higher side in October 2015. That bullish breakout was followed by a rally to $20,000 by December 2017. So, bitcoin’s latest channel breakout could be considered a confirmation of the long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change first signaled by bitcoin’s convincing move above $4,236 on April 2. The probability of BTC posting a strong follow-through over the coming months is high, as the cryptocurrency is set to undergo a mining reward halving in May 2020. The process, aimed at curbing inflation by reducing the reward for mining on bitcoin’s blockchain by half, is repeated every four years and tends to put a strong bid under prices. Notably, bitcoin’s previous bull market ended with a bearish channel breakout almost a year ahead of the reward halving in July 2016. Looking forward, with the monthly chart flashing a historically bullish price pattern, BTC looks likely to register gains in a seasonally mixed month of May. !function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var e in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+e)||document.querySelector(""iframe[src*='""+e+""']"");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][e]+""px"")}})}();  The odds of BTC posting gains in May, however, would fall sharply if the price finds acceptance below the crucial 30-day MA, currently at $5,142. On the daily chart, BTC is currently hovering around the 30-day MA, which reversed pullbacks in March and has served as a base throughout the rally from lows near $3,300 seen in February. As a result, a strong bounce from that average could invite buying pressure, leading to a rally to $6,000. A deeper drop to the 50-day MA at $4,675 could be seen if prices find acceptance below the 30-day MA, validating the short-term bearish case put forward by the bearish divergence of the 14-day relative strength index.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) short-term prospects are looking bleak, but its close proximity to a historically strong price support level calls for caution on the part of the sellers. The crypto market leader faced rejection at the bearish (descending) 50-week moving average (MA) last week and ended with a 2.5 percent drop, neutralizing the short-term bullish setup. A similar rejection at that average had ended up killing the nascent bull market four years ago, as discussed on Friday. Further, with the pullback from five-month highs above $5,600 to $5,000 witnessed last week, the widely-followed 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is flashing bearish. So, the path of least resistance appears to be on the downside in the short-term. That said, investors looking to buy at lower levels may be left disappointed if the 30-day moving average (MA), which consistently applied brakes on price pullbacks in March, again fuels a strong bounce. That possibility cannot be ruled out, as the longer duration charts are still looking bullish. For instance, BTC is currently sitting well above the widely tracked barometer of a long-term trend, the 200-day MA, currently at $4,438. Other long-term indicators like the 14-week RSI are also reporting bullish conditions. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $5,163 on Bitstamp, representing little change on a 24-hour basis, while the 30-day MA is located at $5,107.  While the 30-day MA had served as strong resistance in January, on Feb. 8, BTC confirmed seller exhaustion by establishing a bullish higher low and closing well above the 30-day MA after a 7.8 percent rise. The newfound support has reversed price pullbacks ever since. The chart reveals BTC has established bullish higher lows along the 30-day MA throughout the recent rally, from lows near $3,300 to highs above $5,600. Further, the long-term bullish breakout witnessed on April 2 was preceded by a higher low formation on the 30-day MA on March 26. Hence, a bounce from that average would abort the short-term bearish view and could yield re-test of $5,627 (April 23 high). A UTC close lower would imply an end of the rally from the Feb. 8 lows near $3,300 and allow for a deeper drop, possibly to the 50-day MA, currently at $4,649. That’s supported by the short-term bearish technical setup, as represented by the lower highs on the RSI, the bearish crossover of the 5- and 10-day MAs and the downside break of the channel. BTC has created a red candle with long wicks (the gap between weekly high and opening price and weekly low and closing price) and small body (spread between open and close) on the weekly chart. The candle is widely considered a sign of indecision in the market. The candle, however, appeared following a rally from lows near $3,300 seen in February and at the crucial 50-week MA resistance. So, it could indicate, more specifically, indecision among the buyers. Any break below the 30-day MA would validate the bullish exhaustion signaled by the weekly candle and open the doors to deeper price pullback. The long-term outlook will remain bullish as long as the price is holding above the former resistance-turned-support of $4,236 (Dec. 24 high).

" Bitcoin (BTC) may revisit sub-$5,000 levels in the short-term, as a widely followed technical indicator is flashing a historically bearish pattern. With the recent rally to five-month highs above $5,600, the 50-day moving average (MA) crossed the 200-day MA from below in what’s termed a “golden crossover” – a confirmation of long-term bull market. However, short-term technical indicators, especially a bearish divergence on the relative strength index (RSI), are suggesting a drop in prices before the rally picks up pace again. The bearish RSI pattern is widely considered an early sign of trend change and has yielded notable price pullbacks in the past. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $5,430 on Bitstamp – down 3.5 percent from the high of $5,627 hit earlier this week. Bitcoin first jumped above $5,000 on April 1 and further climbed to highs above $5,400, lifting the 14-day RSI to 88.00 – the highest level since December 2017. With the indicator signaling extreme overbought conditions, bitcoin’s price retreated to $4,912 on April 12 before jumping to a five-month high of $5,627 earlier this week. Essentially, BTC created a bullish higher low at $4,912 and a higher high of $5,627. However, as bitcoin set the new higher high, the RSI instead formed a bearish divergence – a pattern confirmed with the near 2 percent price drop seen in the last 24 hours.  As can be seen above, BTC confirmed a bearish divergence of the RSI with a 2 percent drop to $9,623 on May 6, 2018, and fell 38 percent to lows below $5,800 by the end of June. Before that, the 14-day RSI diverged in favor of the bears with bitcoin’s 6.5 percent price drop to $17,700 on Dec. 19, 2017. That was followed by a quick 36 percent sell-off to $11,200 by Dec. 22. There are earlier notable examples, too (not shown). BTC fell 6.5 percent to $4,600 on Sept. 2, 2017. With the sharp slide, the RSI diverged in favor of the bears and prices tumbled to $2,972 on Sept. 15. Again that was a 36 percent price drop. Another bearish divergence of the RSI on June 12, 2017, was also followed by a quick 20 percent price slide that ended at lows near $2,120 a few days later. If history is any guide, the latest bearish divergence of the RSI could send prices down to $4,912 (April 12 low).  The 30-day moving average (MA), which served as strong support in March, is currently located at $4,969. Importantly, the average is still trending north, indicating a bullish setup. A strong defense of that average would revive the short-term bullish outlook and could yield a rally to fresh multi-month high above the recent high of $5,627. A violation there, however, could invite stronger selling pressure, leading to a drop to the 200-day MA at $4,466. The longer-term outlook will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above $4,236 – the bearish lower high created on Dec. 24 and violated on April 2.

" With bitcoin’s (BTC) move to five-month highs Tuesday, a notable bull cross of key moving averages has formed for the first time in nearly four years. The crypto market leader jumped to $5,627 on Bitstamp earlier today – the highest level since Nov. 18 – having revived the short-term bullish case with a repeated defense of key support at $5,170 last week. Meanwhile, the 50-day moving average (MA) has crossed the 200-day MA from below, confirming a long-term bullish pattern known as a “golden crossover” in technical parlance. This is the first golden crossover since October 28, 2015. Many analysts consider the indicator an advanced warning of stronger price gains in the long term. The crossover, however, is based on moving averages, which are backward-looking in nature. For instance, the 50-day MA is based on 1.5-month old data, while the 200-day MA responds to more than six-month-old price action. Hence, the indicator is more a confirmation of the recent bull run, rather than a signal of further price gains. That said, the investor community may take heart from the fact that bitcoin’s previous bull market began just two days after the golden crossover in 2015.  As can be seen (above left), the 50-day MA last crossed the 200-day MA from below on Oct. 28, 2015, and prices confirmed a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change with a close above $319 (July 12, 2015 high) two days later. The follow-through to that positive trend change was strong and BTC went on to reach an all-time high of $20,000 by December 2017. This time round, the confirmation of the golden crossover has been preceded by the violation of the bearish lower highs and lower lows pattern on April 2. While there is a reason to be optimistic, the golden crossover lags price, as discussed earlier. Further, it tends to work as a contrary indicator in the short-term if the market is looking overbought, which looks to be the case currently.  The cryptocurrency’s move to five-month highs has pushed the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) above 70 – a sign of overbought conditions. Hence, a price pullback cannot be ruled out in the short term. Supporting that argument is bitcoin’s long/short ratio, which has shed the bullish bias. The ratio of BTC/USD long to short positions on Bitfinex (right) is currently hovering just below 1.00 – the lowest level since early January – having printed a high of 1.53 on April 8. The sharp decline indicates the sentiment has turned from bullish to neutral over the last 15 days. Note that a reading well below 1.00 indicates a bearish bias, while an above-1.00 print represents a bullish market.  A close above the April 10 high of $5,466 would establish another bullish higher high and strengthen the case for a rally toward $6,000. However, with the golden crossover accompanied by the overbought readings on the RSI, as well as a bullish-to-neutral shift in the long/short ratio, prices may fail to close above $5,466 or the bullish close could be short-lived. The odds of a fallback to $5,000 would rise if today’s candle ends in the red well below $5,466, validating the lower high (bearish divergence) of the RSI.

" The stalled bitcoin (BTC) rally could again pick up the pace if a new resistance level above $5,200 is convincingly breached. The market-leading cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid at lows below $4,200 on April 2 and jumped to 4.5-month highs above $5,300 on April 8, confirming a bullish reversal. The rally, however, has stalled in the last few days, courtesy of overbought conditions and other factors, as discussed yesterday. Notably, the three-day chart’s 100-candle moving average (MA), currently at $5,238, has been proving a tough nut to crack since April 2. As a result, that lesser-known average is now the level to beat for the bulls. A convincing move above that MA resistance could bring in more buyers, reviving the prospects of the further rally. As of writing, bitcoin is trading at $5,080 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.5 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  The 100-candle moving average has recently been put to test for the first time since May 2018. Back then, the average was trending north, indicating a bullish setup and was located just above $8,400. As of writing, it is sloping downwards, representing a bearish bias, and is seen at $5,238. That bearish signal, however, is of little concern to the bulls, as longer duration averages are lagging indicators. That said, bitcoin has repeatedly failed to secure a three-day close above that average over the last 15 days. A break higher, therefore, may embolden the bulls and allow a sustained move higher toward $5,500. That, however, looks unlikely in the short-run, as the repeated failure at the 100-candle MA is accompanied by early signs of bearish reversal on the shorter duration charts.  BTC created a bearish outside reversal candle Monday – a pattern that occurs when the day begins on an optimistic note, but ends with pessimism. The candlestick is widely considered a sign of potential trend reversal, especially when it appears after a notable rally, as is the case with BTC. Traders, however, wait for confirmation in the form of strong follow-through, preferably a close below the candle’s low. So, a UTC close below $4,948 (Monday’s low) would shift risk in favor of a deeper drop toward the ascending 30-day MA, currently at $4,550. It is worth noting that the 30-day MA served as strong support throughout last month. A bearish close below $4,948 looks likely, as the 5- and 10-day MAs have produced a bearish crossover, validating the signs of buyer exhaustion seen on the weekly chart (last week’s candle was a doji). That said, the longer duration outlook will remain bullish as long as prices are trading above $4,236. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin’s out-of-the-blue bounce over the $5,000 mark this month has prompted some predictable pontificating from price-obsessed people within and outside the cryptocurrency community. Investors who are long-cryptocurrencies have gleefully pronounced that the Crypto Winter, which began when bitcoin’s bubble burst at the end of 2017, is now mercifully over. The most optimistic are forecasting a rerun of bitcoin’s fall 2015 bounce from its prior post-bubble collapse, which sent it not only back above its 2013 high of $1,150 but all the way to a December 2017 peak of $19,500. At the same time, bitcoin skeptics have pointed to the seeming lack of fundamental news behind the price rise and declared it meaningless. Typical of the genre, Matt Novak at Gizmodo penned an angry screed titled “Bitcoin Surges 15% Overnight Because Nobody Learned Their Lesson After the Last Crash.” One of Novak’s insights: “To be clear, bitcoin is absolutely worthless by any real measure. It’s fake money that’s about as practical to use in the real world as Monopoly bills.” Readers won’t be surprised to hear that I disagree with Novak’s simplistic rant. But I’m also turned off by the knee-jerk cheerleading from crypto traders whenever bitcoin’s price bounces. There’s something fundamentally wrong with reducing the measure of bitcoin’s worldwide importance to a price metric that’s denominated in a fiat currency that its advocates hope to replace. It pushes the debate into an inane all-or-nothing binary set of predictions: bitcoin is either going to zero or “to the moon.” What matters is that 10 years after an unidentified software engineer created it, this decentralized system for recording sequences of transactions continues to do its job, block after block, with no authority in charge, no user able to alter past transactions, and no person or entity able to shut it down. The more this goes on, the more it reinforces the powerful vision behind bitcoin: a peer-to-peer, disintermediated system for exchanging value around the world. And in that context, we can also think of bitcoin the cryptocurrency – differentiated from bitcoin the system – as a unique, provably scarce digital asset that expresses the overall value in that vast potential. A point that’s lost on critics like Novak is that the longer bitcoin simply survives – in the face of the $90 billion valuation that stands as a de facto bounty for hackers to try to take it down, compromise its security or corrupt it – the more its overall value is confirmed. Bitcoin is progressively proving itself to be an unstoppable, digital system of global exchange, one that functions outside of the traditional national government-mandated system of currency and banking. That status is what gives bitcoin its value. Of course, the global impact of the bitcoin value exchange system, and therefore its worth to humanity, will be significantly enhanced if adoption advances to a much wider scale and it is used frequently in the world’s transactions. And, yes, a great deal of development work is still needed if it is to ever reach that point. (Some recent technological leaps such as the Lightning Network and the emergence of decentralized, non-custodial asset exchange technologies offer hope that this scaling challenge can be achieved, though nothing is guaranteed.) However, widespread adoption in payments is not necessary for bitcoin to have value. To understand why that’s the case, it’s useful to think about gold, to which bitcoin is often compared. Similar to bitcoin, gold is a mutually agreed store of value that, for all intents and purposes, lies outside the control of nation-state governments and banks. It’s not widely used as a day-to-day currency, but it does enjoy a widespread, shared belief in its value. Where does gold’s value come from? The answer is somewhat tautological: it comes from that same widely held belief, from a shared understanding in gold’s capacity to function as a depoliticized global system of exchange that’s free of manipulation. Sure, we tend to think of gold in terms of its material qualities: that it’s durable and that it’s shiny in a way that connotes beauty. But its lasting worth really derives from the more esoteric notion that human beings have for a long time deeply held a shared belief in its value. That belief has turned gold into a system for protecting property, a system used through the centuries by refugees, dissidents and investors for moving and storing value and for hedging against lost spending power. That we now have a digital version of this concept, one that’s designed for the borderless, internet-shaped world of the 21st century, is a big deal. When dealing with debates over bitcoin’s value, it’s also worth going a little way down the rabbit hole of thinking about what money actually is. Not everyone agrees on a definition, but I think it’s useful to think of money as a societally agreed system for storing and exchanging value. The system has to have certain properties for people to reach this agreement – it must fungible, durable, transferable, divisible, etc. – but it’s the agreement itself that gives it its value. Here, too, is where many of bitcoin’s detractors get lost. Fixating on the misplaced idea of money as a thing, they exclaim that bitcoin can’t have any value as it isn’t backed by anything. This, of course, also misses the fact that it is backed by the energy and other resources that miners spend to do the computational work needed to secure the bitcoin ledger. But the bigger point is that bitcoin’s value, as with all forms of money, comes from the existence of a wide agreement in its potential use as a store of value and medium of exchange. In bitcoin’s case, the agreement is arguably one that involves 35 million people, if Cambridge University’s latest survey of authenticated users is to be believed. This large level of participation is essentially why bitcoin holds a much greater value than the altcoins that are forks of its code. So, this is why bitcoin at $5,000 is important, not because it’s a sign of that new investors are coming to push up its price again, but because it validates the core proposition of bitcoin’s resilience and promise.

" UPDATE (9, April 00:09 UTC): Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, CEO of BCB Group was given a right of reply to defend his statements regarding his findings as cited by Reuters. ——— Mainstream news coverage of cryptocurrency is often disingenuous or factually incorrect – that’s certainly no surprise given the nascent technology is widely misunderstood. But if one would have thought that recent milestones – bitcoin’s 10th anniversary, the arrival of crypto projects from the likes of JP Morgan and Facebook – would have encouraged the media to get smarter, this week’s news shows attitudes at major publishers haven’t changed much.  This is especially true during times of heavy market activity like that of bitcoin’s April 2 breakout, which saw its price rise 17 percent over a 30-minute period. As CoinDesk readers know, the move was foreshadowed by changes in market data and sentiment. With volatility hitting multi-year lows, multiple technical indicators flashings signs of a bottom and fundamental catalysts (the upcoming halving) combining, there were plenty of developments that signaled a change might be on its way.  Still, far from examining developments (or asking serious questions), much of the mainstream media’s coverage devolved into outright theory and speculation.  Here’s the worst of what was a genuinely bad bunch.   While articles like these from Gizmodo are useful in gauging retail sentiment – ie, determining where the average Joe sits in terms of understanding and valuing cryptocurrency – they, unfortunately aren’t useful for anyone who wants to be informed. Writers like Matt Novak have a point – novice retail investors were given a bitter taste in 2018, when the market for cryptocurrencies took a turn for the worse. Still, that’s no excuse for not educating yourself or your readers, who, without such learning, may repeat mistakes.  The article reads: “To be clear, bitcoin is absolutely worthless by any real measure. It’s fake money that’s about as practical to use in the real world as Monopoly bills. Bitcoin is backed by nothing and requires tremendous amounts of energy to mine using computers.” Without spending too much time on this statement, there are a few incorrect passages, that in particular, don’t ring true. For one, bitcoin definitely can act as a medium of exchange. It can be, and today is used to facilitate the commerce and trade of goods between parties, a core fundamental function of modern money.  Next, it’s backed by the computer operators that mine the network itself, all of whom invest real dollars, manpower and equipment in ensuring the network is functional.  Finally, while the cost of mining bitcoin remains high thanks to its large energy consumption, this does not mean it cannot run off renewable energy and take advantage of natural events that reduce the cost and lessen the impact to the environment.  It seems mainstream media tends to forget that the cost of mining bitcoin’s physical competitor, gold, is perhaps even more guilty of harming the earth’s environment as its miners regularly tear apart massive landscapes and leave behind loads of toxic waste. To state that this will forever be bitcoin’s final form borders on ignorance as well, as we have seen time and time again that the evolution of technologies usually comes from a solution to fix a specific problem.  One of the least offensive of the bunch, a Reuter’s report that cited a solo “mystery” buy order as the main cause for a huge price spike still offered a confused take by focusing in on a sole market irregularity.  In particular, it highlights a claim made by the chief executive of cryptocurrency firm BCB Group, Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, who argued the case that the move was the responsibility of a single buyer. The article reads: “Today’s gain (April 2) was probably triggered by an order worth about $100 million spread across U.S.-based exchanges Coinbase and Kraken and Luxembourg’s Bitstamp. There has been a single order that has been algorithmically-managed across these three venues, of around 20,000 BTC.” This is hard to corroborate with independent analysis as the article did not provide evidence of the orders, merely statements that negate other factors.   As the price climbed higher, this resulted in a snowball effect of buying as shorts were closed and limit buy orders were triggered, causing its price to rise faster and higher.  Using an hourly view of bitcoin’s price we can see just how much volume was recorded during a single trading period by looking at the volume bars and order books and then noting their readings. At 4:00 UTC on April 2, Coinbase recorded a total of 6,889 units in a single hour and Bitstamp handled close to 3,798 units while Kraken had the least at 4,121 bitcoin units traded in the same hour. This created a total of 14,808 units traded in the hour of the surge, yet Reuters and CNBC claimed 7,000 units were purchased on each of the three different exchanges in tandem by a single entity at the time of the surge. Needless to say at the time the numbers didn’t quite add up. Also of note, data shows that growing buy volume began to increase substantially across most major exchanges, not just the three highlighted in the article. However, Oliver reached out to Coindesk in order to support his claim by providing the following:",2019-04-06
" Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market have started Q2 off with an emphatic bang, having at one point increased the market’s total capitalization by nearly $40 billion since the beginning of April.  Indeed, bitcoin led the market-wide charge on April 2, surging over 20 percent in a single hour – a move that had since extended to a 136 day high of $5,304 yesterday, according to data from CoinDesk’s price data.  A common byproduct of a rallying bitcoin, however, is diminished returns of the BTC denominated trading pairs of most other cryptocurrencies, as opportunistic investors tend to shift funds into the market leader when it picks up a bid.  Such was proven Tuesday when almost all of the top 50 cryptocurrencies ranked by market cap were posting impressive 24-hour gains in US-dollar value, yet only Nano (NANO) was found to be reporting BTC denominated gains, Messari data revealed.  On Wednesday, though, it seemed investors were rotating funds back into the many other cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin, boosting both USD and BTC denominated values significantly.  !function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"")}})}();
Highlighted above were the top performing cryptocurrencies so far this month as of yesterday’s trading session, according to Messari data. As can be seen bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, once again is being outperformed by others, granted the prices of smaller cryptocurrencies are easier to move since they have smaller market caps and are more thinly traded.  Bitcoin Cash (BCH), a fork of the bitcoin blockchain, is the standout best performer so far this month, at one point flashing 94 percent price growth against the USD, roughly 50 percent of which was recorded on Wednesday alone as its BTC pair surged nearly 40 percent. Litecoin (LTC) has also aggressively extended its impressive Q1 gains into the second quarter of the year. The cryptocurrency’s trade price is now up 43 percent month-to-date, albeit the figure was above 54 percent yesterday, after rising 31 percent in USD value and coming just shy of a $100 price tag on most exchanges.  The price of the “worst” performer in this group on Wednesday was Aion (AION), which aims to act as a bridge connecting different blockchains, still reflected a strong USD denominated increase of 25 percent and a notable 16 percent jump in BTC value.  With the reasons for the recent market surge pointing to technical catalysts, the perhaps unparalleled volatility is creating a day trader’s paradise, although such volatility being back for the long haul is not quite yet a certainty.

" Bitcoin (BTC) could be in for a minor price pullback as the RSI is showing the most overbought conditions for 16 months. The crypto market leader cruised past the crucial resistance at $4,236 on Tuesday, confirming a longer run bearish-to-bullish trend change and hit a 5.5-month high of $5,345 yesterday, according to Bitstamp data. With the near 30 percent rally to 4.5-month highs seen in the last 48 hours, bitcoin’s 14-day relative strength index – a widely-followed momentum indicator – has jumped above 70.00, indicating overbought conditions. In fact, the RSI is currently seen at 89.11, its highest level since December 2017. An overbought reading on the RSI is often taken to be a sign of impending bearish reversal. In reality, however, an above-70 print merely indicates that the rally is overdone and a reaction – a price pullback – could be in the offing. These overbought indicators become valid only when the price begins to flash early signs of buyer exhaustion, which seems to be the case with BTC. The cryptocurrency witnessed a sharp drop to $4,800 within two hours of hitting highs above $5,300 at 21:00 UTC yesterday and is now struggling to hold onto price points above $5,000. As a result, price consolidation or a deeper pullback to $4,600 could be seen in the next couple of days.  The long upper shadow attached to Wednesday’s candle (above left) indicates the bullish move is running out of steam. Validating that argument is the big bearish engulfing candle seen in the 4-hour chart (lower left), which indicates that the period began with optimism but ended on a pessimistic note. Both candlesticks add credence to the extreme overbought reading on the 14-day RSI (right).  On the hourly chart, the RSI has rolled over from the overbought territory, having charted lower highs over the last 48 hours, contradicting the higher highs on price. That bearish divergence also favors a price pullback to key support levels lined up at $4,672 and $4,565 (200-hour MA). Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" The crypto market sprang back to life with bitcoin’s surge to nearly 5-month highs yesterday. But why? To those who have been paying attention to the charts, it shouldn’t come as a surprise. The leading cryptocurrency by market value jumped nearly $1,000 to $5,080 in a 60-minute window early on Tuesday, confirming a transition from bear market to bull market that it had been signaling for some time. In fact, after a year-long bear market, savvy traders were waiting on a trend change that would gain credence if and when prices established the most basic of all bullish technical patterns – a higher low and a higher high on its weekly charts. (A higher high would have been confirmed above $4,236.) Looking back, a big move was overdue, as bitcoin’s average daily trading range had slipped to two-year lows in March. An extended period of low volatility often ends up with a violent move on either side. That low volatility period ended with a strong bullish breakout, possibly due to the following three reasons: As mentioned, bitcoin’s charts have been signaling for some time that a bottom may be in the market. This first began in late February, when we reported that bitcoin’s 50-week moving average dropped below the 100-week moving average, confirming a bearish crossover – the first since April 2015. Long-Term Bitcoin Price Indicator Turns Bearish, Suggesting Bottom May Be In  At the time, we wrote that the lagging indicator had turned bearish for the first time in four years, suggesting bitcoin’s price may have bottomed out after a year of declining prices. We wrote: Put simply, it takes a great effort on the part of the bears to push the 50-week MA below the 100-week MA. As a result, the bear market is usually exhausted by the time the crossover is confirmed, which seems to be the case with BTC. That, however, was just the beginning. Several longer duration indicators, like the weekly money flow index (MFI) and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD), would add evidence to the trend. On March 4, the MFI bottomed, contradicting the lower low in bitcoin’s price. That bullish divergence is widely considered an early warning of a bearish-to-bullish trend reversal, a fact we noted at the time. A rising MFI indicates an increase in buying pressure, while a falling MFI is considered a sign of increasing selling pressures Another Bitcoin Indicator Signals Price Bottom May Be Forming  The same day, the MACD, a momentum oscillator calculated by subtracting the longer-term moving average from the shorter-term moving average, also turned bullish, a fact no doubt noticed by traders. Yet, these technical developments likely reinforced expectations of a stronger rally ahead of the incoming halving, a scheduled, programmatic reduction in the amount of new bitcoin paid to miners. Bitcoin is set to undergo a mining reward halving in May 2020 and historical data indicates the process tends to put a bid under the cryptocurrency at least a year in advance. (The protocol automatically reduces new issuance after a certain number of blocks are processed, an event that occurred most recently in 2016). What is the ‘Halving’? A Primer to Bitcoin’s Big Mining Change  Markets first took note of this possibility in December 2018 after the sell-off ran out of steam near $3,100. The particular price pattern was reminiscent of how the previous bear market had ended at lows near $150 in early January 2015 – 17 months before a reward halving in August 2016. Indeed, historical data shows that bitcoin traders generally respond to the halving, and that the event serves as a signal and potential catalyst.  The narrative that BTC is set to repeat history by breaking into a bull market at least a year ahead of the next mining reward halving (due August 2020) has only strengthened over the last three months, possibly leading to the bull breakout yesterday. Indeed, analysts had been arguing for months that with the next bitcoin halving expected to happen in May 2020, the time had come for investors to start paying attention to this pattern. Bitcoin’s Next Halving Rally: Coming Soon in 2019  One can’t rule out market irregularities, though, and there appear to have been some yesterday. Reuters reported Tuesday that a single algorithmically managed order worth $100 million spread across several major exchanges – Coinbase and Kraken and Bitstamp – triggered the sudden rally to multi-month highs. Meanwhile, Bitfinex data indicates that the unwinding of bearish bets created upward pressure on prices. BTC/USD short positions plunged from 20,654 BTC to 17,103 BTC between 04:00 and 06:00 UTC yesterday; later declining further to 16,978 BTC – the lowest level since March 2018. After falling more than 17% Tuesday, funds in short positions climbed back up 13 percent. Looking forward, BTC could witness a minor pullback to levels below $4,700 in the short-term. The overall outlook, however, will remain bullish as long as BTC remains above $4,236. BTC revisited yesterday’s high of $5,080 earlier today. The bullish move, however, was accompanied by a lower high on the relative strength index (RSI). That bearish divergence indicates scope for a pullback to the ascending (bullish) 50-hour MA, currently at $4,572.  But both the triangle breakout and the bullish higher high above $4,236 indicate the tide has turned in favor of the bulls. Validating that argument are the ascending 5- and 10-week moving averages. That said, with the short duration charts reporting overbought conditions, a break above the crucial 21-month exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $5,200, may not happen in the next few days.

" Bitcoin’s price emerged above three major moving averages for the first time in nearly 15 months on Tuesday. The development is a byproduct of the cryptocurrency’s surge above $5,000 during Tuesday’s trading session, representing an increase in excess of 20 percent. A moving average (MA), when used in financial analysis, is simply a continuously calculated average of a certain economic factor like price or trading volume over a specified period of time. The moving average is particularly useful for smoothing out short-term fluctuations in the data set to identify the direction of the longer term trend.  Certain moving average durations like the 50, 100 and 200 day MA’s are of more importance when analyzing the price of a traded asset because they tend to display if recent price action is out or under performing its recent or distant trends, which can highlight bullish or bearish market conditions. Perhaps most significant is the 200 day MA, which is commonly regarded as the dividing line between a strong market and weak one. Notably, bitcoin’s price is now trading above these three key moving averages in first since January 13, 2018.   As can be seen in the chart above, bitcoin at the time was priced closer to $15,000 before falling below the 50 day moving average, according to Bitstamp figures. Contrary to what occurred today, this was a bearish signal that pointed to a degree of loss to the strength of the short term trend.  Not long after falling below the 50 day MA, bitcoin’s price found acceptance below the remaining two moving averages, solidifying the newfound bearish trend.  Recently, however, the opposite appears to be the case.  Bitcoin’s price began trading above both the 50 and 100 day moving averages on Feb. 18 of this year, suggesting its trend was beginning to pick up strength. Roughly three weeks later 50 day MA crossed above the 100 day MA, which is an example of a moving average trading strategy called the bullish crossover that is generally considered a buy signal.  Last but not least, bitcoin’s price was able to trade above the 200 day moving average today for the first time since it fell below the MA on March 14, 2018.  Looking back at bitcoin’s historical price data, the 200 day moving average indeed appears to be an important obstacle to gain acceptance above.  As can be seen, bitcoin’s price rose 7,500 percent after finding acceptance above it as well as the 50 and 100 day MAs on October 15, 2015. Notably, its price remained above the 200 day MA for the entire uptrend, until after the market had topped in early 2018.  It’s important to note major moving averages are also touted for offering price support and resistance, so the 200 day MA is likely to be a stubborn technical hurdle until bitcoin’s price can close on a UTC basis above it.

" After today’s breakout, bitcoin (BTC) now needs to move above crucial resistance near $5,200 to solidify the case for a longer-term bull market. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization crossed the last bearish lower high of $4,236 (Dec. 24 high) at 04:30 UTC Tuesday and jumped to $5,080 – the highest level since Nov. 19 – confirming a transition from a bear to a bull market. The rally to a 4.5-month high was accompanied by a surge in 24-hour trading volumes to above $15 billion – the highest since mid-January 2018, according to CoinMarketCap. The bullish reversal, therefore, looks sustainable. Further, the spike witnessed today has reinforced the positive trend change signaled by both the weekly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and the money flow index a few weeks ago. While the path of least resistance is now to the higher side, the bulls now face taking out the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA), currently lined up at $5,200. The persistent defense of that average support in the five months to October 2018 had triggered hopes of a strong bullish move. More importantly, a convincing break below that technical line on Nov. 14 invited strong selling pressure. So the bulls need to force a convincing break above the 21-month EMA before claiming a complete victory over the bears. As of writing, bitcoin is changing hands at $4,800 on Bitstamp, representing a 15 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. Other major cryptocurrencies like ethereum’s ETH token, XRP and EOS are up at least 5 percent each. Meanwhile, names like litecoin, cardano and monero are flashing double-digit gains. As seen above, BTC’s move above $4,236 has activated twin bullish cues: A bullish higher high and a triangle breakout, both confirming a bearish-to-bullish trend change. The 5- and 10-week moving averages (MAs) are also trending north, indicating a bullish setup, while the relative strength index (RSI) is probing the former support-turned-resistance of 53.70. A break higher would further strengthen the bullish case.  BTC came close to testing the 21-month MA, currently at $5,200, earlier today. A monthly close above that average would solidify the bullish reversal and encourage further buying, possibly leading to a move above $6,000. A break above the 21-month EMA, however, may remain elusive for a few weeks, as the cryptocurrency is looking overbought on shorter duration charts.  On the daily chart, the 14-day RSI is at 86.00 – the highest level since December 2017. The overbought reading would gain credence if the cryptocurrency creates bullish exhaustion patterns (e.g. doji, bearish engulfing, or inverted bearish hammer candles) in the next few days. In that case, prices could fall back to $4,400 (Nov. 29 high) and consolidate for a period. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" The first quarter of 2019 was a breath of fresh air for the cryptocurrency market, having recorded its first quarterly increase in overall network valuations since the fourth quarter of 2017. Interestingly, however, bitcoin is among the least significant price gainers so far this year while still flashing a noteworthy Q1 increase of 10 percent. What this means is that a sizable portion of the market’s recent growth came from the many other cryptocurrencies trading on exchanges today.  In fact, data from analytics provider Messari reveals that 118 cryptos increased more in price on a year-to-date basis than bitcoin, with several boasting triple-digit percent increases during that period.  As a result, the total network value of all cryptocurrencies – excluding bitcoin – came within 1 percent of suprassing that of bitcoin’s in March. With Q1 of 2019 now in the history books, let’s dive into some of the more notable individual performances by way of breaking down their respective asset size classes and market sectors.  There is a wide spectrum of assets, in the cryptocurrency market. These range from some of the biggest, like ethereum (close to $15 billion), to the smallest, like dancoin (DAN), which is worth just over $3 million. Hundreds of networks fall in between.  The table below depicts how Messari segments crypto-asset sizes into the four groups (large cap, medium cap, small cap and micro cap), as well their respective best and worst performers for the Q1 period. !function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"")}})}(); While the highest-ranked cryptocurrencies in terms of asset size tend to be the most well-known coins in the industry (they trade with the most volume), data shows they are not always the strongest performers. As can be seen, the top performers in both the medium and small-cap segments saw significantly better Q1 performances than the leader of the large-cap segment, binance coin (BNB), the price of which nearly tripled during that period.   Ravencoin’s (RVN) performance surpassed all other medium cap cryptos, boasting a 386 percent increase in Q1, almost all of which was achieved in the month of March when its price jumped from the monthly open of $0.013 to its close of $0.061, according to data from Binance.  Pchain (PAI) was the best performer in the small-cap segment as well as the single strongest performer in the entire cryptocurrency market. PAI recorded a Q1 price increase of roughly 781 percent, Messari data reveals.  While many cryptocurrencies boasted double and even triple-digit gains in Q1, not all outperformed bitcoin or even finished the quarter with gains. Bitcoin SV’s (BSV) 26 percent loss and NEM’s (XEM) 13 percent loss was enough to establish them as the worst performers in the large and medium cap segments, respectively, while the worst performer of the broader market was the small-cap crypto Grin (GRIN), which lost 70 percent of its value since its main-net launch on January 15. It should be noted that market cap as a metric for valuing crypto-assets does have limitations not observed when used in traditional finance for valuing a publicly traded company. For example, lost bitcoins are technically accounted for in bitcoin’s market capitalization, even though they are no longer part of the “circulating” supply and can never be spent. This is not an issue when determining the market cap of a company since only outstanding and liquid shares are taken into account, leading cryptocurrency researchers to come up with alternative network valuation models like  “realized cap“, first proposed by Coinmetrics in 2018, that aims to account for such limitations. Another way to segment the cryptocurrency market is by sector, which describes the key parts of the crypto-economy.  Messari provides a number of different market sector classifications, the Q1 average and median performance of which are shown in the table below, and were calculated by taking the performance of the top 5 coins by market cap in each sector into account. !function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"")}})}(); As can be seen, the “Miscellaneous” sector was the best performing sector in Q1 on average, but this was largely due to the fact the best and near 800 percent quarterly gainer Pchain (PAI) is included in the category. Since PAI’s growth significantly skews the average performance of the sector, the median which describes the true middle value of a given sector’s quarterly performances, perhaps most honestly describes the sector with a more modest 52 percent median price increase. The strongest sector in terms of median performance in Q1 were the coins intended to act as bridges between cryptocurrencies, making those networks interoperable. That list is comprised of names like Ontology (ONT), Chainlink (LINK) and Aion (AION). The sector finished Q1 with a 78 percent increase as the median performance. In all, the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap in each sector averaged no worse than a 20 percent price increase. It’s one accomplishment to have a strong quarter. It’s another feat entirely for an asset to trade above its 200-day moving average.  Generally regarded to as the dividing line between a strong market and one that is not, the 200-day moving average is a technical hurdle that several top-ranked cryptocurrencies were able to climb above for the first time this quarter in nearly a year.  !function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"")}})}(); The last time CoinDesk conducted the same analysis on March 13, just four of the top 20 cryptocurrencies had both of its BTC and USD pairs trading above the 200 day moving average as signs of life in the market were just beginning to re-emerge.   Since then, however, four more cryptocurrencies joined the list, including Ontology (ONT), Tezos (XTZ), Cardano (ADA), and EOS (EOS) all of which now are trading with both pairs above the moving average. This indicates that a shift from bearish to bullish trends is on the rise.  Still lagging behind with neither trading pair above the MA are the first and third largest cryptocurrencies in the world by market cap, bitcoin (BTC) and XRP (XRP), as well as six others (not including USDT and Bitcoin SV, the latter of which has less than 200 days of trading history). Indeed, Q1 was an impressive stretch for the cryptocurrency market, which has seemingly renewed optimism among some of its market participants.  On March 22, CoinDesk Markets conducted a Twitter poll to gauge the public’s longer term outlook on the market leader bitcoin by asking what price it will trade closest to on the date of its next supply production halving event in May of 2020. On the day of #bitcoin's next halving, what will its price be closest to? The next halving is anticipated to occur in May of 2020. — CoinDesk Markets (@CoinDeskMarkets) March 22, 2019  Interestingly, the most popular option was a value closest to $15,000, accumulating 47 percent of the 6,450 votes.  Currently priced around $4,000, that would mean the majority of those polled believe bitcoin will increase at least 275 percent or nearly quadruple its value in less than 14 months.

" Bitcoin made double-digit gains in the first three months of 2019, marking its best quarterly performance since Q4 2017. The crypto market leader closed (UTC) yesterday at $4,096, representing a 10.91 percent gain on January’s opening price of $3,693, according to Bitstamp data. That is the first double-digit quarterly gain since the final three months of 2017 when prices had rallied a staggering 220.84 percent. Back then, the bull market was raging on hopes that listing of bitcoin futures on major US exchanges would open the doors to the yield-hungry institutional investors. That, however, did not materialize and prices fell by 73.39 percent in 2018. !function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"")}})}();  As can be seen, the latest double-digit quarterly gain has come after a prolonged bear market but looks more than the usual corrective bounce with prices mimicking the bottoming pattern seen before the 2015 bull breakout. Further, a closer look at the monthly price action indicates the cryptocurrency is likely making a slow transition from a bearish to a bullish market. January: Seller exhaustion Bitcoin fell 7.59 percent in January, but the monthly high and low fell within the trading range of the previous month. Essentially, BTC created “an inside month” candle, a sign of bearish exhaustion. February and March: Higher lows BTC established a bullish higher low near $3,300 on the weekly chart in the first week of February and jumped to a high of $4,190 on Feb. 24. The rise above $4,000, however, was short-lived and prices fell back to 3,600 at the end of February. BTC had charted its way back to $4,100 by the end of March with multiple bullish higher lows along the 30-day moving average. The bearish exhaustion followed by a steady stream of higher lows has raised hopes of BTC confirming a bull breakout with a move above $4,236 (Dec. 24 high). However, if history is any guide, then a sustained break above $4,236 may not happen for a few more months. It is worth noting that the bullish breakout seen in October 2015 was preceded by a nine-month period of consolidation. In the short-term, the path of least resistance appears to be on the higher side. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $4,122 on Bistamp – up 0.82 percent on a 24-hour basis.  As seen on the weekly chart (above left), BTC created a bullish engulfing candle last week, reinforcing the bullish view put forward by the ascending 5- and 10-week moving averages (MAs). On the daily chart (above right), BTC created a bullish higher low along the 30-day MA on March 25 and closed well above $4,055 on Friday. That strengthened the bullish case put forward by the upward sloping 5- and 10-day MAs, the bullish crossover of the 50- and 100-day MAs and the long-tailed doji created on Feb. 27. As a result, BTC look set to test the Feb. 24 high of $4,190. Even so, there is merit in being cautious, as the cryptocurrency created a doji candle on Saturday – a sign of bullish exhaustion – and so far, the cryptocurrency has struggled to find acceptance above $4,130 (doji candle high). A persistent failure to convincingly scale $4,130 would weaken the bullish case and could yield a pullback to the 30-day MA, currently at $3,938.

" Bitcoin is slowly gaining altitude with a long-term lagging indicator flashing signs similar to those seen before the 2015 bull breakout. The crypto market leader rose to $4,100 at 10:30 UTC on Bitstamp today – the highest level since Feb. 24 – validating a bullish higher low established along the crucial 30-day moving average (MA) support earlier this week. Prices, therefore, could rise further toward the February high of $4,190 in the next few days. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $4,075, representing 0.5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. While BTC’s short-term prospects seem to have improved with the move, a longer term bullish reversal above $4,236 still remains elusive. A convincing break above that level, however, could happen in the next few months, according to historical data related to bitcoin’s three-day chart 200-candle moving average (MA). That average is based on two-year-old data and tends to lag price by more than a year. For instance, bitcoin’s price topped out at $20,000 in December 2017 and has been charting lower highs ever since. The 200-candle MA, however, continued to trend north indicating a bullish setup throughout 2018 and shed the bullish bias (turned flat) this month – three months after price sell-off ran out of steam near $3,100. A similar action was seen in months leading up to the long-term bullish reversal of October 2015, as seen in the chart below.  As seen above right, the 200-candle MA continued sloping upwards through the December 2013 to January 2015 bear market and turned flat in March/April 2015 – three months after the end of the sell-off at $152. The cryptocurrency traded largely in the range of $200-$300 in the next six months before breaking into a bull run in October 2015. It is worth noting that the average had begun trending south three months before the bull breakout. If history is any guide, then BTC may spend the next few months in the recent trading range of $3,100–$4,300 and could pick up a strong bid once the key average starts trending lower.  Bitcoin’s break above the March 21 high of $4,055 is accompanied by a bull flag breakout, a bullish continuation pattern, on the 4-hour chart (above right). Further, the 14-day relative strength index is reporting bullish conditions with an above 50.00 reading (see daily chart, left). As a result, the February high of $4,190 could soon come into play. A longer-term bullish reversal would be confirmed if prices close above that level on Sunday. The short-term bullish case, however, would weaken if prices fail to close above $4,055 today.

" Bitcoin now has a high price target if it is to see a bullish reversal this month, price charts suggest. The leading cryptocurrency jumped more than 10 percent in February, snapping the record six-month losing streak. More importantly, the recovery rally seen in February engulfed the price action seen in the preceding month. Essentially, BTC created a bullish engulfing candle on the monthly chart following an 80 percent drop from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017. While that pattern is widely considered an early warning of potential bullish reversal, traders usually wait for more credible signs of a trend change, preferably a close above the candle’s high. Put simply, a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change would be confirmed if prices close (UTC) above the February high of $4,190 on March 31. That would also reinforce the bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by several longer duration indicators over the last few weeks. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at around $4,000 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.4 percent rise on a 24-hour basis.  BTC clocked a high of $4,190 and created a bullish engulfing candle last month – likely a sign of bargain hunting following a prolonged sell-off. So far, the follow-through has been positive, confirming the bear exhaustion. A UTC close above $4,190 on March 31 would confirm a longer-term bullish reversal and open the doors to the psychological hurdle of $5,000. A failure to close above that key level would weaken the bullish case and could increase selling pressure.  On the daily chart, BTC bounced up from the 30-day moving average (MA) earlier this week, invalidating Monday’s bearish close below $3,920. However, the case for a monthly close above$4,190 would strengthen if prices establish a higher high above the March 21 high of $4,055 in the next 48 hours. That would also confirm a bull flag breakout on the 4-hour chart – a continuation pattern which often accelerates the preceding bullish move. On the downside, the 30-day MA, currently at $3,900, is the level to beat for the bears. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Believe it or not, there are more ways to anticipate the future market value of bitcoin than through practicing technical analysis or by observing network activity developments.  While valuable in their own right, thanks to researchers Willy Woo and David Puell, several new experimental bitcoin valuation metrics were released in February that combine the two fields to create a more holistic view of bitcoin’s market.   Sample sizes are small in the cryptocurrency markets, with the oldest, bitcoin, having existed just 10 years, but two of the newly released metrics termed “Top Cap” and Delta Cap” have shown to be effective at identifying the tops and bottoms of bitcoin’s wild market cycles thus far.  Proposed by Puell, the metric that successfully caught both bear market bottoms in 2011 and 2015, and that is known as the Delta Cap, is calculated as follows: Delta cap = Realized cap – Average cap Average cap =  “cumulative sum of daily market cap values / age of the market in days.” Realized cap = “UTXOs are aggregated and assigned a price based on the BTCUSD market price at the time when said UTXOs last moved”  Resembling a long-term moving average that is touted for offering price support and resistance, the delta cap has shown to have the same effect by providing price support at roughly $2.50, the bottom in 2011, and $176, the bottom in 2015.  As can be seen above, delta cap is making a case for bitcoin having bottomed out once again, a point made evident by the fact that its price bounced off of the metric during its drop to $3,200 at the end of 2018, Indeed, delta cap may be pointing to bitcoin’s market leaving its bearish trend, but there could be more nuance to the situation than first meets the eye. Bitcoin has only ever bottomed out and escaped one of its infamous bear markets after the delta cap and average caps have collided with eachother, or came very close to it, as can be seen in both 2011 and 2015. At the time of writing, delta cap is about $1,600 higher than the average cap, theoretically suggesting bitcoin’s price will either have to wait for the average cap to rise and meet the delta cap, or the delta cap will need to fall to meet the average cap by way of more significant market depreciation before a true bottom can form. Proposed by Woo in collaboration with Puell, top cap aims to achieve the opposite of the delta cap, in that is has been experimentally configured to pinpoint the tops of bitcoin’s explosive bull markets.  Top cap = Average cap * 35 According to Woobull.com, the multiple of 35 was found to pinpoint bitcoin historical tops. As can be seen, the metric also resembles a moving average and effectively provided resistance at $35 in 2011, $237 in 2013 and once again at around $1,000 in the same year, all of which were precise market tops followed by significant, albeit temporary depreciation.  Most recently, bitcoin’s price came in contact with the top cap when its market reached peak euphoria and an all-time high near $20,000 in 2018. At the time of writing, bitcoin’s price is still roughly 80 percent below the all-time high.  When both delta and top cap are plotted on the same chart, a “valuation Bollinger band” is created as Woo puts it, where the two metrics create the anticipated boundaries of bitcoin’s market movement.  Currently located at $48,724, the top cap paints a rosy picture for the future of bitcoin if it indeed endures another boisterous bull market, although the creator Woo thinks $90,000 is a better estimate “at a minimum on the early trajectory” for bitcoin’s next significant market top.  Disclosure: The author holds several cryptocurrencies, please see Sam’s author profile here for more information.  Math image via Shutterstock; Charts from Woobull.com",2019-03-28
" Bitcoin (BTC) has once more rebounded from the 30-day moving average, thwarting a bearish move that saw prices drop below $3,920 on Monday. The move sees the crypto market leader return from uncertain ground 24 hours ago, having dived out of the $3,920-$4,055 trading range on Monday. That range breakdown coupled with the signs of bullish exhaustion on the longer duration charts had opened the doors for a deeper drop below the 30-day moving average (MA) at $3,883, as discussed yesterday. The MA support, however, held ground despite the bearish setup, allowing BTC to climb back to $4,000. Essentially, the cryptocurrency has established a bullish higher low along the key average for the third time this month. While the bearish case has weakened, the short-term bullish view put forward by the long-tailed doji created on Feb. 27 would only be revived if there is a strong follow through to the rebound from the 30-day MA support, preferably a break above the recent high of $4,055 hit on March 21. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $4,015 on Bitstamp, representing a 2.6 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. A high of $4,031 was clocked soon before press time.  As seen above, BTC has picked up a bid following the defense of the 30-day MA, currently at $3,889. The higher-low pattern would gain credence if the bounce ends up establishing a higher high above the March 21 high of $4,055. That would expose the February high of $4,190, above which a major hurdle is seen at $4,236 – the bearish lower high created on Dec. 24. On the downside, a UTC close below the 30-day MA is the target for the bears.  On the 8-hour chart, BTC has breached the falling channel on the higher side and the breakout is backed by a bullish relative strength index (RSI) reading of 61.00. So, prices may find acceptance above $4,040 in the next few hours. The bullish case, however, would weaken if the rising trendline hurdle proves a tough nut to crack.

" Bitcoin (BTC) is on the defensive after briefly falling below $3,900 at around 07:00 UTC this morning. The cryptocurrency fell to a 10-day low of $3,850 on Monday, confirming a downside break of the recent trading range of $3,920–$4,055. Further, BTC closed (UTC) yesterday below $3,920, reinforcing the bearish outside reversal candle created on March 21. The repeated failure to scale $4,000 in a convincing manner followed by the drop below $3,920 validates the bearish view put forward by the historically strong resistance of the downward sloping 21-week moving average (MA). As a result, the cryptocurrency risks falling below the 30-day MA, currently flatlined at $3,883, in the short-term. Notably, that average has put brakes on the sell-off at least three times in the last three weeks. Hence, a break below $3,883 could further strengthen the bear grip around the cryptocurrency. The bearish case, however, would weaken if the price bounces up strongly from the 30-day line. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,906 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.73 percent drop on a 24-hour basis. As seen on the 4-hour chart, BTC has found acceptance below the 100-candle MA support, having dived out of the sideways channel yesterday. While the 200-candle MA has held ground in the last 12 hours, its repeated defense has failed to produce a stronger bounce – a sign that bullish sentiment has waned. Validating that argument is the fact that the major averages (50, 100 and 200) have shed bullish bias (are flatlined). On the daily chart, BTC has breached the ascending trendline and the 5- and 10-candle MAs have produced a bearish crossover, validating yesterday’s bearish close below $3,920. Hence, both the 200-candle MA on the 4-hour chart and the 30-day MA, currently at $3,888 and $3,883, respectively, could take up the role of resistance in the next 24 hours.  The previous three-day candle closed below $3,920 – the low of the preceding doji candle – confirming a bearish reversal. As a result, the path of least resistance appears to be on the downside.

" Bitcoin’s average daily trading range so far in March is its lowest in nearly two years when, at the time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency was worth roughly a quarter of what it is now.  At the time of writing, bitcoin’s average 24-hour trading range so far this month, defined as the average difference between the high and low price of each day in a given month, has been just $85, its lowest average range since the same metric recorded $32 in April of 2017, according to CoinDesk data. Notably, the average trading range (also known as the average daily volatility) segmented by month has fallen much faster than bitcoin’s market prices as can be seen below.  Indeed, bitcoin is currently trading across exchanges at an average price of $3,943, comparable to levels seen in September 2017, while volatility has returned to levels observed when bitcoin’s price was roughly $1,000. Yet, periods of low volatility tend to precede a big move in either direction in a market, as was the case in 2017. In fact, April of 2017 was the first month to close sufficiently above the top of its previous bull run in 2013 and was followed by a multi-year bear market. After April closed with an average daily trading range of $32, the price of bitcoin went on to surge 65 percent the following month with an average daily trading range of $153 – nearly four times higher than that seen the month prior. Just as bitcoin’s price was indecisive in April as it approached the key technical hurdle of a previous all-time high, bitcoin is now approaching another major technical hurdle in the form of long term downtrend resistance.  As shown above, bitcoin’s current price is just below a crucial downtrend line, which if broken could be a sign its market has shifted from bearish to bullish or at-least bearish to neutral, just as it did in 2015 when prices surpassed a near identical downtrend line.

" Chart signals of bullish exhaustion suggest bitcoin’s (BTC) narrowing trading range could soon be breached to the downside. The leading cryptocurrency by market value is sidelined below $4,000 for the fourth straight day, and has been restricted to the narrow range of $3,920–$4,055 since March 17, according to Bitstamp data. More importantly, prices clocked a high and low of $4,055 and $3,920, respectively, last week before closing Sunday (UTC) largely unchanged at $3,970. The price swing formed what’s termed a doji candle on the weekly chart, which is usually taken to represent indecision in the marketplace. The candle, however, has appeared following a 20 percent rally from lows near $3,300 seen at the end of January. So, it could be argued that the indecision, as represented by the doji, is predominantly among the buyers. As a result, the probability of BTC ending the ongoing consolidation with a convincing break below $3,920 appears high. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,970 on Bitstamp, largely changed on a 24-hour basis.  As seen above, BTC created a doji candle at the crucial 21-week moving average (MA) resistance, validating the bearish view put forward by that still-downward sloping momentum indicator. The case for the downside break of the $3,920–$4,055 trading range looks stronger if we take into account the price action seen over the last five weeks. To start with, BTC hit a high of $4,190 and created a bullish inverted hammer candle in the third week of February – a sign the market is bottoming out. That candlestick is usually followed by a quick move to the higher side. In the last four weeks, however, BTC has failed to again challenge $4,190, weakening the bullish case.  On the daily chart, the short-term MA studies are now biased toward the bears, with the 5-day MA having dropped below the 10-day MA. Further, with the price well below the March 21 high of $4,055, the bearish outside-reversal candle created on that day is still valid. So, the sideways channel seen in the 4-hour chart could be breached to the downside in the next day or two. A range breakdown if confirmed would open the doors for a deeper drop toward $3,658 (Feb. 27 low). A UTC close well above $4,055 would revive the short-term bullish view and could yield a rally toward $4,200, although gains may be short-lived, as the 21-week MA is still trending south.

" Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped back from levels over $4,000, but the short-term outlook will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above key support at $3,920. The crypto market leader jumped to a 25-day high of $4,055 yesterday, having secured a bullish UTC close above the psychological hurdle of $4,000 on Wednesday, going by Bitstamp data. The breakout above the crucial three-day chart resistance of $4,040, however, was short-lived with prices falling back to a five-day low of $3,920 before closing the day at $3,974. Notably, the negative price action engulfed the trading range seen in the previous four days, which is widely considered an early sign of bull exhaustion. That said, the path of least resistance is still to the higher side, as the bounce from lows near $3,920 has left the bullish higher lows pattern intact along the trendline connecting the Feb. 8 and Mar.4 lows. For the immediate outlook to turn bearish, the engulfing price action seen yesterday needs a strong follow through in the form of a convincing break below $3,920. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,980, representing a 1.28 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  On the daily chart, BTC created a bearish outside reversal candle yesterday as trading began on an optimistic note but ended with pessimism. A bullish-to-bearish trend change, however, would be confirmed only if prices close below $3,920 (low of the bearish candle) today. A move below $3,920 would confirm a downside break of the ascending trendline and shift risk in favor of a deeper drop toward the Feb. 27 low of $3,658. On the higher side, a break above $4,055 would reinforce the short-term bullish setup and could fuel a rally toward the recent high of $4,190.  The odds of a rally toward $4,235 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline) would strengthen if the current three-day candle closes (today) above $4,040, validating the bullish engulfing candle created in three days to March 16.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) 14-month bear market has ended up creating a similar price pattern to one that paved the way for a bull run in 2015. The cryptomarket leader is currently trading at $4,030 on Bitstamp, having hit a low of $3,122 in December. Despite the recovery rally, the price is still down 79.85 percent from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017. Throughout the sell-off, the cryptocurrency has charted a series of lower highs and lower lows, known as descending channel in technical parlance. Bitcoin produced a similar pattern during the previous bear market witnessed in 2014–2015. More importantly, the upside break of that falling channel, confirmed in October 2015, was followed by a two-year bull market. Therefore, a potential upside break of the latest falling channel could be considered a sign of a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  As can be seen above, the price action seen over the last 14 months looks very similar to that seen in 2014 and early 2015. The previous bear market had stalled with the 14-week relative strength index (RSI) hitting oversold levels below 30 in January 2015. Similarly, the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 hit in December 2017 also ran out of steam with the RSI falling below 30 in December 2018. So, if history repeats itself, the cryptocurrency may see a sustained channel breakout later this year. An early move above the upper edge of the channel, currently at $4,070, could be seen as several indicators are flashing early signs of bullish reversal. Further, BTC is trading just below the breakout price at press time. Such an early move, however, could be short-lived or may lack a strong follow-through as long as the 21-week moving average (MA) is trending south. As of writing, the MA resistance is seen at $4,073.  Both the higher lows-higher highs pattern and the ascending 5- and 10-day MAs seen on the daily chart indicate the path of least resistance is to the higher side. As a result, the cryptocurrency may soon validate the bullish outside reversal candle on the three-day chart with a convincing move above $4,040, as discussed yesterday. That would allow a rally to recent highs near $4,200. The short-term bullish case would weaken if prices drop below $3,927 (Mar. 17 low).

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) bulls need to break key resistance at $4,040 to force a continued rally, the three-day chart indicates. The leading cryptocurrency by market value is trapped in the range of 3,920-$4,020 for the fourth consecutive day, having created a bullish outside-reversal or “engulfing” candle in the three days to March 16. A bullish engulfing candle occurs when the period begins with pessimism but ends on an optimistic note, engulfing the preceding period’s price action. While it is widely considered a bullish signal, traders usually wait for confirmation in the form of strong follow through, preferably a convincing move above the high of the engulfing candle. Put simply, a break above $4,040 – the high of the candle – is needed to validate the indicator. That would further reinforce the short-term bullish outlook put forward by the long-tailed doji candle created on Feb. 27 and allow a re-test of the recent highs near $4,200. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,986 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.3 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  The small doji candle created in the last three trading days has taken the shine off the preceding bullish outside reversal candle. A convincing move above $4,040 (candle’s high) will likely invite strong buying pressure and yield a rally to the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance, currently at $4,230. That possibility looks likely, as the 5- and 10-candle moving averages (MAs) are biased bullish and BTC’s price is still holding above the ascending trendline. However, any gains above the 21-week simple moving average (SMA) at $4,073 could be short-lived, as that average is still trending south, as discussed earlier this week.  On the 4-hour chart, BTC is struggling to force a descending triangle breakout, which, if confirmed, would boost the prospects of prices finding acceptance above the crucial resistance at $4,040. A break below the triangle low of $3,927, however, could yield a deeper pullback to $3,850. That said, a bearish reversal would be confirmed only if the support at $3,658 (Feb. 27 low) is breached.

" Bitcoin’s dominance rate, or its share of the total cryptocurrency market, is on the verge of falling below 50 percent for the first time in over seven months.  At press time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency accounts for 50.9 percent of the total capitalization of the entire market and fell as low as 50.54 on March 17, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Before 2017, bitcoin’s dominance rate was perpetually in excess of 70 percent, but it began to deflate as new cryptocurrencies were created and sold to investors in initial coin offerings (ICOs), causing bitcoin’s dominance rate to drop to a low of 32.48 percent on Jan. 13, 2018.  Since, Aug. 11 of last year, however, bitcoin’s share of the cryptocurrency market has not fallen below 50 percent.  Having traded between $3,200 and $4,300 since Dec. 2018, bitcoin’s recent drop in market dominance can be attributed to a strong performance from the broader altcoin market, comprised of all cryptocurrencies excluding bitcoin, rather than any significant depreciation to its own market.  In the past 90 days alone, names like enjin (ENJ), binance coin (BNB) and litecoin (LTC) have witnessed significant price increases of 406, 181 and 97 percent respectively, according to data from Messari. As a result, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding bitcoin has grown 33 percent since hitting a 2019 low of $51 billion on Feb. 6 to its current value of roughly $69 billion.  In the same time span, bitcoin’s market capitalization has also seen notable growth, but to a lesser extent than the altcoin market. Since Feb. 6, bitcoin’s market cap has increased from $59 billion to its current value of $71 billion – a jump of 20 percent. Bitcoin’s shrinking dominance could be seen as a sign the crypto markets are shifting to a “risk-on” environment where investors prefer riskier assets, as altcoins are perceived to be. The rate falling below 50 percent would be a greater indication of this type of sentiment coming to fruition. As it stands, the total capitalization of the broader cryptocurrency market records $140.6 billion, down 83 percent from its all-time high of $835 billion set on Jan. 7, 2018.

" Bitcoin (BTC) is showing signs of buyer exhaustion and could see a minor pullback unless resistance at $4,000 is scaled in the next few hours. The crypto market leader witnessed two-way business yesterday before closing (UTC) on a flat note at $3,969 on Bitstamp. Essentially, BTC created a doji candle, which is widely considered a sign of indecision in the marketplace. Notably, the fact that the doji candle has appeared close to the historically strong resistance of the 21-week simple moving average (SMA), currently at $4,073, suggests the indecision is predominantly among the bulls and could be considered a sign of buyer exhaustion. So, a price pullback could be on the way, especially if support at $3,930 is breached in the next few hours. That said, the rally from the March 14 low of $3,775 could resume if prices rise above the resistance at $4,000, invalidating the doji candle. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,975, representing a 0.4 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  On the daily chart, BTC looks to be creating the right shoulder of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, having bounced up from the rising trendline last week. The 5- and 10-day MAs are also trending north, indicating a bullish setup. Even so, the rally has stalled near $4,000 and a doji candle has appeared, validating the bearish view put forward by the descending 21-week SMA, currently at $4,073. BTC, therefore, risks falling back to the rising trendline support at $3,890. A break lower would expose the March 14 low of $3,775. It’s worth noting that bitcoin may have a tough time scaling or holding onto gains above the 21-week SMA as long as that average is trending south.  As can be seen, BTC has created a minor bull flag – a continuation pattern that usually accelerates the preceding bullish move. A break above the upper edge of the flag, currently at $4,000, would open the doors to $4,305 (target as per the measured move method) However, the bullish exhaustion signaled by the doji candle would gain credence if prices fall below the flag support at $3,930. In that case, BTC will likely revisit key support levels at $3,890 and $3,755. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) four-week price rally now faces a former support-turned-resistance level that repeatedly capped gains in 2018. The crypto market leader closed (UTC) yesterday at $3,965, representing a 1.73 percent gain on a weekly basis, according to Bitstamp data. That was the fourth straight weekly gain and the longest winning streak since April 2018. With strong volumes backing bitcoin’s move to a three-week high of $4,040 over the weekend, the case for an extension of the ongoing recovery rally from January lows looks strong. However, a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change above $4,236 may remain elusive for few weeks, as the 21-month simple moving average (SMA) – a technical line which acted as strong resistance in 2018 – is currently located at $4,073. More importantly, the average line is still trending south in favor of the bears, and bitcoin is not likely to breach it with a 90-degree rally. Further, with BTC struggling to hold on to gains above $4,000 for the third day running, the bullish momentum is beginning to wane. As of writing, the BTC is changing hands at $3,955 on Bitstamp, having hit a high of $4,016 earlier today.  On the weekly chart, bitcoin printed bullish higher lows along the 21-week SMA throughout the 2016-2017 uptrend. The average support was breached on Jan. 29, 2018, and has reversed rallies ever since. As such, a convincing move above that SMA, currently at $4,073, could be considered an early sign of a long-term bullish reversal. It is often observed that markets tend to consolidate post-break above a downward sloping MA and pick up a strong bid once the average has shed bearish bias (bottomed out). For instance, BTC jumped above the descending 100-day MA on Feb. 19, but the follow-through quickly fizzled out near $4,200 and prices fell back to the long-term MA on March 4. More importantly, bitcoin lacked clear directional bias and rose back to $4,000 only after the average turned flat on March 14. Thus, any break above the 21-week SMA needs to be viewed with caution as long as the average line is trending south. A repeated rejection at the average line could invite selling pressure, as seen in November.  On the daily, BTC closed above $3,950 (Mar. 9 high) on Saturday, bolstering the short-term bullish setup as indicated by both the ascending trendline and the upward sloping 5- and 10-day MAs. So far, however, the follow-through has been anything but bullish, which adds credence to the possibility of a pause in upward momentum suggested by the weekly chart.

" Bitcoin’s user growth, as represented by active addresses, has spiked in the last eight weeks leaving the price far behind, a move that contradicts the popular belief the two tend to move in tandem. The 30 day average of active addresses on bitcoin’s blockchain, or the number of accounts that made cryptocurrency transactions at any point during the last 24 hours, total 664,064 as of March 16– up 17 percent from 569,812 seen on Jan. 20. Bitcoin’s 30 day average price, however, has increased just 1 percent during the same time span, according to Coinmetrics. An uptick in active addresses is taken by many as a sign of the cryptocurrency’s increasing popularity or investor confidence. The active addresses count, however, tends to rise even when long-term dormant “HODLers” move out of the cryptocurrency and into fiat. So, betting on a price rise every time active addresses spike could prove costly. Other network activity metrics like the network volume and the transaction amount to active addresses ratio (TAAR) tend to shed more light on how network activity impacts bitcoin’s price.  *coinmetrics.io As can be seen above, the divergence between active addresses and bitcoin’s price has become quite large, which perhaps comes as a surprise given the two rose and fell in unison for much of 2018. But while the divergence between the two metrics is indeed growing, it’s hardly been the first time such a development has occurred. For instance, active addresses maintained notable growth throughout the entire bear market that spanned nearly two years from 2014 to early 2016, which implies active addresses may not be the most predictive fundamental metric for bitcoin’s price. Since active addresses are only a measure of how many accounts are actively making transactions, other metrics like network volume and TAAR can be used to provide insight into the actual amount of funds the addresses are spending. As can be seen in the chart below, the 30-day average of bitcoin’s network volume, or the amount of funds (USD) transmitted through its blockchain, appears to have a much stronger relationship with the price of BTC/USD than the trend of active addresses. Perhaps not coincidentally, when viewed on Coinmetrics’ semi-log graph, the 30-day avg. of transaction volume has been quite precise in identifying bitcoin market tops and bottoms, as depicted by the average line either falling below or rising above prices.  *coinmetrics.io Upon closer examination, it can be seen the network volume has also seen an uptick over the past couple of weeks. The 30-day average of network volume has increased from $2.24 billion on Feb. 17, to $2.86 billion on March 16, an increase of roughly 27 percent. In the same time bitcoin’s average price increased just over 8 percent from $3,568 to $3,862. Indeed, bitcoin’s transaction volume appears to track prices more accurately, but since the number of active addresses is also a valid reflection network usage, it’s worth viewing how the interplay between the two impact bitcoin’s price, if at all. First introduced by founder of Pugilist Ventures, Chris Brookins, the TAAR metric “acts as an “equilibrium” gauge of bitcoin’s price to fundamentals valuation, where transaction volume and active addresses both represent “quantity and quality” growth of the bitcoin network” In other words, TAAR represents how the interplay between the two metrics that measure the quantity (transaction volume) and quality (active addresses) of network activity impacts bitcoin’s price as opposed to viewing their effects in isolation.  While the sample size is small, spanning only a few years, it is clear that bitcoin’s market reacts positively when the TAAR is in an uptrend and reacts negatively when it is not. As can be seen, however, the TAAR is still in an apparent downtrend and has deviated from bitcoin’s price trend, indicating the fundamental metrics that measure the quality and quantity of activity on bitcoin’s blockchain is not at equilibrium with its price. Active addresses are indeed growing faster than bitcoin’s price is increasing, but the metric only tells half the story. The amount of funds passed through the blockchain, known as network volume, is also a key measure of network activity, as it shows how much is being transferred, not just how many accounts are conducting transactions. When the interplay between the two is depicted, the TAAR metric shows bitcoin’s network activity has room to grow before confirming a bullish effect on the market.

" Daily trading volume for the world’s largest cryptocurrency bitcoin exceeded $11 billion Friday, the most observed in a 24-hour period since April 25 of last year. At that time, the average price of bitcoin was $8,845, while today the crypto asset is listed for less than half the price, currently trading at $3,951 as per CoinMarketCap. However, the return in volume is potentially a sign investors aren’t losing interest in bitcoin despite the less than favorable market conditions. Interestingly, the amount of bitcoin trade volume had closely aligned with it’s price trend for years, but upon closer examination, the close connection ended during the latest market rout in November when trade volumes failed to sink along with the quickly depreciating broader cryptocurrency market. As can be seen below, the divergence between trading volume is evident for not only bitcoin, but other top-ranked cryptocurrencies like the fourth-largest in the world by market cap, litecoin (LTC).    Just before the plunge to $3,000, bitcoin was priced at $6,385 on Nov. 10 when it accumulated $3.70 billion in 24-hour exchange volume, according to data from Coinmarketcap. Today, however, bitcoin’s price is nearly half of what it was in November, yet its trading volume is just above $11 billion, which is 200 percent more than the trading volume seen on Nov. 10 and a value last commonly observed in April 2018. Coinmarketcap data further reveals the most exchange volume the world’s largest cryptocurrency ever saw in a single day was $23.84 billion when bitcoin’s price was $17,429.50 on Jan. 05, 2018.    Litecoin’s exchange volume is following a similar trajectory as bitcoin’s exchange volume. As can be seen above, exchange volume began to deviate from litecoin’s price trend around November once again, when the cryptocurrency was trading in the $50 dollar range and exchange volume figures spanned from roughly $300 million to just over $600 million, according to data from Coinmetrics. Litecoin’s is now trading at $58 and its 24-hour exchange volume registers $1.79 billion – again, more than double the values frequently observed before the cryptocurrency plunged below $30 in November. The slight difference between litecoin and bitcoin’s trading volume and price relationship is that litecoin’s price has increased over 100 percent since its December low along with the rise in exchange volume, while bitcoin has seen a more seldom 20 percent increase from its low.

" Bitcoin’s current period of price consolidation may end with a bull breakout, price-volume analysis indicates. While the cryptomarket leader is lacking a clear directional bias for the tenth straight day, 24-hour trading volume remains elevated near the 10-month high of $10.75 billion seen on Feb. 24, contradicting the popular theory that investor interest drops in a rangebound market. As a result, the pullback from recent highs near $4,200 appears likely to be nothing more than a bull breather and BTC could soon draw bids. Validating that argument is the fact that the recovery rally from the lows near $3,400 seen on Feb. 8 was backed by high volumes. Daily trading levels jumped above their 50-day moving average 35 days ago and have remained above the key metric ever since – a feat last observed during the height of the bull market in the third quarter of 2017, according to CoinMarketCap data. Hence, the probability of BTC ending the ongoing consolidation with a strong move to the downside is quite low. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,930, representing a 0.5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinMarketCap. Twenty-four-hour trading volume is seen at $10.62 billion, while the 50-day moving average of daily trading volume is seen at $7.615 billion.  As seen above, BTC jumped 7.5 percent on Feb. 8 (arrow), invalidating the immediate bearish setup. The strong move was backed by a hike in trading volumes above their 50-day MA. Since then, volume bars have consistently printed above the key average, validating the corrective rally from $3,400. The setup looks even more bullish if we take into account the higher lows and higher highs on volume chart. Recent price pullbacks were accompanied by a drop in volumes (lack of bear support), explaining the weak follow-through to the rising channel breakdown witnessed on Feb. 24. The failed breakdown coupled with elevated volumes amid price consolidation indicates scope for a re-test of $4,208 (Feb. 24 high). That said, the long period of consolidation could test the bulls’ resolve, and a brief drop below the immediate support of $3,865 (March 12 low) could be seen before a continuation of the rally.

" Bitcoin’s struggle for direction continues amid growing signs of a bull reversal in alternative cryptocurrencies. The leading cryptocurrency by market value is trapped in the range of $3,800 to $3,900 for a ninth straight day, contradicting the quick move toward the recent high of $4,190 suggested by the long-tailed doji candle created on Feb. 27. The immediate outlook, therefore, is neutral. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is flatlined at $3,847 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.10 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. Further, BTC is reporting a meager 4 percent gain on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, as opposed to stellar gains in few altcoins. For instance, litecoin, the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently up 83.9 percent on a YTD basis. Binance coin (BNB) and holochain (HOT) are up at least 140 percent each, while EOS (EOS) and ontology (ONT) have gained 40 percent and 69 percent, respectively, according to OnChainFX. Meanwhile, both the BTC and USD pairs of LTC, BNB, Tron (TRX) and Maker (MKR) have found acceptance above their respective 200-day moving average (MA) – a widely followed barometer of bull/bear markets. As a result, speculation that the altcoin market has entered the bull market is gathering steam. However, while few alternative cryptocurrencies seem to have witnessed a bull reversal, the altcoin market as a whole is yet to violate the bearish trend, as seen in the chart below.  On the weekly chart, the altcoin market capitalization (market cap) printed a higher low near $45 billion in early February, signaling bearish exhaustion. However, the trendline connecting January 2018 and April 2018 highs is still intact. A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $64.28 billion (trendline resistance) could be considered an early sign of longer-term bullish reversal. A bearish-to-bullish trend change, however, would be confirmed, if and when, the market cap jumps above $68.61 billion – a bearish lower high created on Dec. 24.  The week-long price consolidation in the range of $3,800-$3,900 seen in the above chart has weakened the bullish case put forward by the long-tailed doji candle created on Feb. 27. As a result, the 100-day MA support at $3,670 could again come into play. On the higher side, a UTC close above $3,950 is needed to revive the short-term bullish outlook.

" Bitcoin is trapped in a key trading range defined by the 200-week simple moving average and the 200- week exponential moving average, currently at $3,404 and $4,106, respectively The cryptocurrency needs a break above the upper edge needed to confirm a longer-term bull reversal. Conversely, a move below the lower bound of the range could revive the bear market. Prices fell below the 200-week EMA in the third week of November, bolstering the bearish view put forward by the high-volume breach of the crucial support at $6,000 on Nov. 14. The ensuing sell-off, however, ran out of steam in mid-December with prices bouncing up from the SMA, then located near $3,100. Notably, that average has served as strong support at least three times in the last three months. So far, however, seller exhaustion has failed to produce strong buying pressure, as is evident from bitcoin’s repeated failure to break above the EMA over the last 13 weeks. With prices stuck between key MAs, bitcoin’s immediate outlook as per the weekly chart is neutral. The crypto market leader is currently trading at $3,850 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.4 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  On the weekly chart, BTC witnessed corrective rally after defending the 200-week SMA support in mid-December and early February. However, on both occasions, the bounce failed to secure a close above the 200-week EMA. With several weekly indicators now reporting early signs of bull reversal, the probability of bitcoin confirming a bearish-to-bullish trend change with a weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above the 200-week EMA at $4,106 appears high. That could pave way for a bullish higher high above $4,236 (Dec. 24 high) and a rally toward $5,000.  The odds of BTC challenging the lower edge of the trading range would rise if prices find acceptance below $3,658, invalidating the bullish long-tailed doji candle created on Feb. 27. A weekly close below the 200-week SMA at $3,404 could yield a sell-off to levels below $3,000. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Several well-known cryptocurrencies are trading above their 200-day moving averages, a development typically considered a sign of a healthy market. A moving average (MA) is simply an ongoing calculation of the closing prices of an asset over a specified period of time, but is also a tool traders use to gauge the asset’s trend direction as well as support and resistance levels.  While a moving average of any length can be used, the 200-day moving average is a standard in financial analysis. Put simply, an asset trading above the 200-day MA is considered bullish (likely to move higher), while one trading below it is considered bearish (likely to move lower).  Since the long-time market leader bitcoin is not currently trading above its 200-day moving average, one could be forgiven for assuming all other cryptocurrencies are following its footsteps.  However, that is not the case.  !function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"")}})}();
Of the top 20 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization as per CoinMarketCap, both the BTC and USD pairs of litecoin (LTC), binance coin (BNB), Tron (TRX) and Maker (MKR) are currently trading above their respective 200-day moving averages. Both pairs trading above the moving average indicates the markets for LTC, BNB, TRX, and MKR are much stronger than those with acceptance above just one trading pair moving average or those with acceptance above neither – most of which fall under the latter category. Indeed, the four cryptocurrencies have the most bullish markets, but as can be seen above, their performance is not yet the norm. Twelve of the top 20 cryptocurrencies have neither their BTC or USD trading pairs above the 200-day MA, and as the data below shows, several are still very far away. !function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"")}})}(); Of the remaining top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap that are not trading above their USD-denominated 200-day MA, bitcoin cash (BCH) is by a large margin the farthest away from achieving a healthy market while EOS is the closest. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the price of BCH/USD would need to increase 124 percent in order to reach its 200-day moving average while EOS/USD would need to increase just 8 percent. It’s worth noting Bitcoin Cash underwent a hard fork in November resulting in the creation of two new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Cash ABC and Bitcoin SV. Bitcoin Cash ABC retained the BCH/USD ticker on most exchanges so its longtime price history may not be the best reflection of the current state of the Bitcoin Cash ABC market, given the fork has existed less than 200 days. While it does express a weak market, an asset trading excessively far below its 200-day moving average is not always a negative indication. It can also be a sign of extreme oversold market conditions, similar to how the Mayer Multiple is used to gauge bitcoin’s market conditions based on its relation to the 200-day MA. With that in mind, the assets that are farthest from their respect 200-day moving averages like bitcoin cash and Zcash, which needs to increase 71 percent to reach its 200 day MA, could be seen as the most overdue for a positive correction.

" A widely-followed bitcoin (BTC) price indicator is about to turn bullish for the first time in seven months. Bitcoin’s 50-day moving average (MA) – currently located at $3,669, according to Bitstamp data – could soon move above the 100-day MA at $3,670. The event would confirm the average’s first bullish crossover since the end of August 2018. However, the bull cross is a lagging indicator, being based on past data, and in this instance is likely more a product of bitcoin’s recovery rally from lows near $3,100 seen in December. That said, with several key indicators, like the weekly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and the money flow index flashing early signs of bullish reversal, the probability of the cross trapping the bulls on the wrong side of the market seems low. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,860, having clocked a low of $3,791 earlier today.  As seen above, the 50-day MA is taking an upward turn and is about to cross the 100-day MA from below. Further, BTC’s repeated defense of the 100-day MA over the last 12 days has strengthened the bullish case put forward by the long-tailed doji candle created on Feb. 27. As a result, BTC could soon rise toward the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance, currently located just below the bearish lower high of $4,236 printed on Dec. 24. A UTC close higher would confirm a bearish-to-bullish trend change and could yield a rally to $5,000.  On the weekly chart, the 5- and 10-candle MAs produced a bullish crossover two weeks ago. BTC also defended the 10-candle MA in the previous two weeks, reinforcing the bullish reversal signaled by the MA studies. In the near-term, BTC looks likely to challenge the recent high of $4,190.

" Bitcoin (BTC) needs to climb at least anther $350 to confirm a long-term bullish reversal, technical charts suggest. The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $3,903 – having rallied 24.8 percent from this year’s low of $3,122 seen in December. This positive trend has spurred hopes that the sell-off from the late 2017 record high of $20,000 is over. Validating that argument are a number of long duration technical indicators flashing early signs of bullish reversal. To name a few, the weekly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is at its most bullish for over a year. The money flow index, which takes into account both bitcoin’s price and trading volume, is also trending north, validating the bullish divergence created in December. That said, BTC is yet to invalidate the most basic of all bearish technical indicators – a lower high, lower low.  On the weekly chart, BTC has been charting regular bearish lower price highs and lower price lows since January 2018. These were essentially shallow bounces that ended up recharging the engines for a drop to further lows. The last lower high of $4,236 created on Christmas Day, however, failed to challenge the preceding lower low of $3,122. And since then, BTC has been creating higher lows in the region of $3,300. While the latter is evidence of seller exhaustion, a bullish reversal would only be confirmed if and when BTC prints a higher high above the Christmas Day lower high. Put simply, a break above that level is needed to mark a successful transition from bearish to bullish trend change. So, with bitcoin’s price currently trading at $3,890, that target is still $350 away.  As seen above, the previous bear market ended with bitcoin charting a higher low near $230 in April 2015. The bullish reversal was confirmed in November 2015 when BTC convincingly breached the bearish lower high of $297 carved in March 2015. It’s worth noting the failed breakout above $297, witnessed in July, which was followed by a drop all the way back to $200.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) repeated failure to beat resistance at $3,900 is a slight cause of concern for the bulls. Having bounced up strongly from the 100-day moving average (MA) support on Tuesday, bitcoin was expected to make a quick move toward the psychological hurdle of $4,000. In the last two days, however, the bullish momentum faded near $3,900 – the high of the candle with long upper shadow created on Feb. 28. Further, the spike to a 12-day high of $3,924 seen earlier today was short-lived with prices quickly falling back to lows near $3,860. BTC’s inability to force a convincing break above $3,900 may invite selling pressure. That said, the short-term outlook would turn bearish only if prices drop below the Feb. 27 low of $3,658. As of writing, BTC is trading largely unchanged on the day at $3,880. BTC witnessed a symmetrical triangle breakout on the hourly chart at 07:00 UTC. The follow-through, however, was bearish with the following candle closing back inside the triangle pattern. Still, the failed breakout has not done significant damage to the bullish view, as prices have again bounced up from the 50-hour moving average. A deeper pullback to $3,750 could be seen if another failure at $3,900 is followed by a break below the bullish higher low of $3,826.  On the daily chart, BTC bounced strongly from the 100-day MA support on Tuesday, restoring the short-term bullish view put forward by the long-tailed doji candle created on Feb. 27. The bullish outlook would be invalidated if prices see a UTC close below $3,658 (Feb. 27 low). That would expose levels below $3,500, although the drop could be short-lived as the longer duration indicators are flashing early signs of bull revival.

" Bitcoin still needs to beat several key resistance levels to confirm a longer-term bull reversal. The leading cryptocurrency is currently trading at $3,840 on Bitstamp, having hit a high of $4,190 last week. At that level, BTC was up 34 percent from the lows near $3,100 seen in December. With the recovery rally, a number of longer-term bitcoin price indicators like the moving average convergence divergence and the money flow index are flashing early signs of bull revival. The trend change, however, would gain credence if and when prices establish the most basic of all bullish technical patterns – a higher low and a higher high. BTC has carved out a higher low near $3,300 in the last two months and a higher high would be confirmed above $4,236 – a bearish lower high created on Dec. 24. So, the focus is on $4,236 and two more resistance levels – $4,190 and $4,388 – which, if breached, will generate strong bullish cues. Let us now explore all three levels in detail.  BTC created an inverted bullish hammer candle with a high of $4,190 during the week ended Feb. 24. That candlestick pattern occurs when the bulls test bears’ resolve to keep prices lower and is widely considered an early warning of potential bullish reversal if it appears after a prolonged sell-off, as is the case with BTC. A bullish trend change, however, would be confirmed once prices cross $4,190.  As noted earlier, a longer-term bull revival would be confirmed if prices violate the bearish lower high of $4,236 created on the Christmas day. It is worth noting that a break above $4,236 would also confirm an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout, which essentially represents a successful transition from the bearish lower high-lower low pattern to the bullish higher low-higher high pattern. The breakout would open the doors to $5,100 (target as per the measured move method).  The cryptocurrency is still trapped in a bearish channel. The upper edge of the falling channel is currently located at $4,388. Notably, the downward sloping 50-candle MA is also located there. A 3-day close above $4,388 would confirm twin bullish cues: a falling channel breakout implying a long-term bullish reversal and an upside break of the bearish moving average resistance. That would further raise the odds of a rally towards $5,000. It is worth noting the probability of BTC breaching the second resistance would rise once the first resistance is scaled.  Bitcoin’s strong bounce from the 100-week moving average witnessed earlier this week restored the short-term bullish view put forward by the “long-tailed” doji candle created on Feb. 27. Further, the 5- and 10-week MAs have produced a bullish crossover for the first time since August 2018. So, a re-test of January high of $4,190 could be on the cards. That bullish case, however, would weaken if prices find acceptance below $3,658 (Feb. 27 low). Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" With bitcoin’s (BTC) quick reversal of the losses seen on Monday, the technical charts are again pointing to a rally to $4,000. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization jumped to a high of $3,877 yesterday, before seeing a UTC close at $3,844, according to Bitstamp data. The 3.9 percent gain engulfed the 2.4 percent drop registered on Monday. The bounce from the 5-week moving average (MA) support at $3,703 has reinforced the bullish view put forward by the ascending indicator. The average is also bullishly holding above the 10-week MA for the first time since August 2008, as discussed yesterday. Further, BTC’s persistent defense of the 100-day MA line, seen below $3,700, in the last nine days has weakened the high-volume bearish outside reversal witnessed on Feb. 24. So, the doors look open for BTC to revisit $4,000 – more so, as the hourly chart is showing a bullish continuation pattern. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,840, representing a 3 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  Bitcoin’s strong bounce from the 100-day MA support line on the daily chart has strengthened the bullish signal of the long-tailed doji candle created on Feb. 27. Prices could soon rise above $3,897 – the high of the doji candle with long upper shadow created on Feb. 28. That would further raise the odds of a rally to the psychological hurdle of $4,000. The 100-day moving average (MA) is also now flatlined (has shed bearish bias), which adds credence to the long-term bearish exhaustion signaled by the longer duration indicators.  A bull flag breakout seen in the above chart indicates that the rally from lows below $3,700 has resumed and could yield a rally to $4,040 (target as per the measured move method). Supporting that bullish case is a relative strength index (RSI) of 67.00. A failed breakout is possible, though, which would take the shine off the bounce from key support at $3,700 and weaken the immediate bullish case. That said, a bearish reversal would be confirmed only if prices find acceptance under $3,658 (low of the long-tailed doji on the daily chart).

" Bitcoin (BTC) has returned above crucial support at $3,700 and could bounce higher if it can defend that level going forward. The crypto market leader fell 2.4 percent yesterday to $3,670, raising the odds of the bears coming out victorious from the ongoing tug-of-war with the bulls in the range of $3,658-$3,900. Prices, however, are still trapped in that trading range, so the immediate outlook is neutral. Notably, sellers have been struggling to secure a convincing break below the widely-followed 5-week moving average (MA) located at $3,703. The MA is now trending north and is holding above the 10-week MA for the first time since August 2018, indicating the path of least resistance is to the higher side. A repeated defense of that level could invite a wave of buying and a re-test of recent highs near $4,200. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,720 on Bitstamp  As seen above, the 5- and 10-week MAs have produced a bullish crossover for the first time in six months. Further, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is printing a strongest bullish signal in over a year, while the money flow index has breached the upper edge of its current channel, validating a bullish divergence confirmed in December. A strong bounce from the 5-week MA could yield re-test of $4,190 (last week’s high). A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above that level would confirm a bullish reversal and open the doors to the psychological hurdle of $5,000.  On the daily chart, the 5- and 10-candle MAs are trending south, indicating a bearish setup. Prices, however, are still holding above $3,658 (low of the long-tailed candle created on Feb. 27). A UTC close below that level could put the focus back on the big bearish outside reversal candle charted on Feb. 24 and trigger a sell-off to levels below $3,400. The sell-off, however, could be short-lived, unless it is backed by a surge in trading volumes. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) has become the latest charting indicator to signal bitcoin may soon see a trend reversal that could put an end to its months-long price decline. As reported, the money flow index (MFI), an indicator used to identify buy and sell pressure, created a divergence Sunday widely considered to be an early sign of a bearish-to-bullish trend change, while last week, bitcoin saw a bearish crossover of its 50- and 100-week moving averages, a first since 2015. As such, the MACD became the latest in a series of indicators, that when applied to bitcoin point to seller exhaustion and a potential trend reversal as of Monday. The MACD, by definition, turns two trend-following moving averages into a momentum oscillator by subtracting the longer-term moving average from the shorter-term moving average. The price trend is considered to have turned bullish when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, the 9-period exponential moving average of the MACD line, at which point the histogram rises above the zero line. The higher the histogram, the father apart the MACD and signal line are, indicating stronger momentum. As can be seen in the chart below, both bullish indications have indeed taken place.  Bitcoin’s MACD line and signal line completed a bullish cross in early February suggesting a reversal to the predominant downtrend may be in order. Since then, the histogram, representing the space between the two lines, has gradually increased to where it stands now at 102.38 – its highest value since January of 2018. Further, the histogram failing to set lower lows during its plunge from $6,000 to roughly $3,000 is another form of bullish divergence that points to weakening bearish momentum. It’s worth noting the MACD did make a bullish cross accompanied by a positive histogram value in September of last year before the fall to $3,000, but the lack of separation between the MACD and signal line was evident and an indication the crossover was weak or invalid. This time around, the follow-through after the crossover is much more substantial.  It can be seen in bitcoin’s weekly price chart from 2015 that the strong bullish MACD crossover accompanied by rising, positive histogram values indeed confirmed the cryptocurrency’s price bottom had been set. What’s more, bullish divergence within the histogram was evident before the positive cross of the MACD and signal line, similar to how it is in bitcoin’s current MACD readings. While indications of bitcoin’s price having bottomed out continue to emerge, caution is still the name of the game, so a break to new price lows backed by high sell volume would invalidate the bullish MACD signals.

" Bitcoin (BTC) has taken a knock Monday and the sell-off could intensify if key support near $3,650 is breached. The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $3,700 on Bitstamp, down more than 3 percent on a 24-hour basis, having clocked a low of $3,670 earlier today. Essentially, BTC has revived the sell-off from the highs near $3,900 hit on Feb. 28 with a drop to six-day lows below $3,700 and bearish pressures would further strengthen if prices find acceptance below the support at $3,658. That would invalidate the bullish view put forward by the “long-tailed doji” created on Feb. 27. It is worth noting that the longer duration indicators are increasingly calling an upside move. For instance, the weekly chart moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram has jumped to its highest level since January 2018. Therefore, any dip below $3,658 (low of long-tailed doji) could be short-lived, unless the breakdown is backed by a surge in daily trading volumes to levels above the recent high of $10.79 billion. As seen above, BTC is currently probing the support at $3,683, which marks the confluence of the former resistance-turned-support of the upper edge of the triangle and the 100-day moving average (MA). A UTC close below $3,658 (low of long-tailed doji) would put the focus back on the high-volume bearish outside reversal candle carved out on Feb. 24 and open the doors to recent lows near $3,300. On the higher side, a move above $3,897 (high of the candle with long upper shadow) would strengthen the bullish case and allow a rally to $4,190 (February high). The bullish scenario looks likely, courtesy of growing signs of seller exhaustion on longer duration charts.  The 5- and 10-candle MAs on the weekly chart have produced a bullish crossover for the first time since the third quarter of 2018. Further, the money flow index has taken out the upper edge of the triangle, validating the bullish divergence
carved in December. The MACD histogram is most bullish in over 12 months, as noted earlier. And last but not least, the bearish crossover of the 50- and 100-week MAs – a big-time lagging indicator – is signaling seller exhaustion, as discussed last month.

" A technical indicator that incorporates both bitcoin’s price and trading volume is signaling the cryptocurrency may have bottomed in December. The money flow index (MFI), also known as the volume-weighted relative strength index, is used to identify buying and selling pressure and oscillates between zero to 100. A rising MFI indicates an increase in buying pressure, while a falling MFI is considered a sign of increasing selling pressures. Essentially, the MFI validates or confirms price trends. Many times, however, the indicator diverges from the prevailing market trend. For instance, BTC dashed hopes of a long-term bullish reversal with a break below $6,000 on Nov. 14 and hit a 15-month low of $3,122 on Dec. 15. The 14-week MFI also nosedived from the high of 43.00 in mid-November, confirming the sell-off in prices. The indicator, however, bottomed out with a higher low at 22.00, contradicting the lower low in bitcoin’s price. That bullish divergence is widely considered an early warning of a bearish-to-bullish trend reversal. Supporting that argument is the fact BTC snapped its record six-month losing streak with a 10 percent gain in February and the MFI rose from 25 to 44. Other indicators like the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and the bearish crossover of the 50- and 100-week moving average are also signaling long-term bearish exhaustion. These tools, however, don’t incorporate trading volumes. The MFI, therefore, stands out as a more reliable technical tool. That said, with a number of indicators pointing to bullish reversal, the probability of BTC picking a strong bid a year ahead of the mining reward halving appears high. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,785 according to CoinDesk data.  As seen above, the MFI diverged in favor of the bulls in mid-December, despite BTC sliding to lows near $3,100. Further, it carved out another higher low at 25 at the end of January and is now rising toward the upper edge of the channel. A breakout on the MFI, if confirmed, would reinforce the bullish divergence witnessed in December. When it comes to BTC, $4,190 is the level to beat for the bulls, as it is the high of the inverted bullish hammer carved out last week. That candlestick pattern indicates the bulls are beginning to test bears’ resolve to keep prices low – a sign the market is bottoming out. A convincing move above $4,190, if backed by a rise in the money flow, could yield a rally toward the psychological resistance of $5,000. The bullish case presented by the MFI would weaken if the February low of $3,328 is breached with high volumes. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin has witnessed indecisive trading in the last 48 hours and would turn bullish again if prices rise above $3,897. The crypto market leader jumped to a high of $3,897 yesterday, according to Bistamp data, having shown strength with a “V-shaped” recovery from lows near $3,650 on Wednesday. That bullish follow-through, however, was short-lived with prices closing (UTC) largely unchanged on the day at $3,791. So, with buyers and sellers battling it out in the range of $3,650-$3,900, the immediate outlook is neutral. The probability of bulls coming out victorious with a move above $3,900 is high, as the dip demand witnessed on Wednesday reinforced the high-volume bullish triangle breakout, confirmed on Feb. 19. Also, so far, the follow-through to the pullback from yesterday’s high of $3,897 has been anything but bearish. BTC is currently trading at $3,810 on Bitstamp, having snapped the record six-month losing streak with double-digit gains in February.  BTC created a candle with a long upper shadow yesterday, establishing $3,897 is a level to beat for the bulls in the short-term. A UTC close above that level would validate the “buy the dip” mentality signaled by Wednesday’s long-tailed doji and open the doors to $4,190 (last week’s high). A bull breakout, however, may remain elusive, if prices find acceptance below $3,658 (Wednesday’s low). That would put the focus back on the big bearish outside reversal candle carved out on Feb. 24 and possibly yield a deeper drop toward $3,400.  As seen above, the ascending 100-candle moving average (MA) has been limiting the downside since Feb. 24. The average is also holding above the 200-candle MA, meaning the trend is bullish. The bullish case, however, would weaken if the 100-candle MA, currently at $3,778, is convincingly breached. However, with the longer duration charts flashing early signs of a bullish reversal, as discussed earlier this week, the odds of BTC suffering deeper losses toward $3,400 appear low.

" With February’s crypto market activity now etched in the record books, signs are emerging that a long crypto winter may be close to an end. The total market value of all cryptocurrencies jumped 14.14 percent over the 28-day period – the first monthly gain since July, according to CoinMarketCap, largely due to signs of life in bitcoin. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, BTC appreciated by 12.1 percent to end February by breaking its record six-month losing streak. But while BTC lifted the broader market, lesser-known names like Maker (MKR), Theta Token (THETA), Enjin (ENJ) and Metronome (MET) outshined with double-digit gains. Of the four, MKR was the month’s best performing large-cap cryptocurrency, defined as one with a market capitalization above $500 million. THETA was the outperformer from the mid-cap group, while ENJ and Metronome (MET) were the top entries from the small- and micro-cap groups, respectively. The data and analytics website Messari segments cryptocurrencies on the basis of their market cap as follows: large caps (>$500 million), medium caps ($100 million -$500 million), small caps (<$100 million) and micro caps (<$10 million). Let us now dive into their individual performance details:  Monthly performance: 83.6 percent
All-time high: $1,763.64
Closing price February 28: $675
Market capitalization February 28: $668.1 million Maker (MKR) topped the large-cap segment with an 83.6 percent gain over the course of February and was able to reach $773 on February 24 – its highest price since early October. As it stands, MKR is the second most expensive cryptocurrency in the entire market after the world’s largest, bitcoin. MKR is one of two separate digital assets operating within the MakerDAO ecosystem along with its subsidiary stablecoin Dai (DAI).  MKR tokens are created or destroyed depending upon certain price fluctuations of DAI in order to keep the stablecoin pegged to the USD. CoinDesk recently reported a substantial increase in Maker’s Collateralized Debt Positions, with the total amount of ether locked up in MakerDAO loans now having crossed above 2 million, a notable feat amid the crypto winter. The monthly price chart indeed reflects the degree of bullishness that took place. As can be seen above, the monthly candlestick has engulfed the three prior months and closed above its 14-month long falling channel – both of which suggest more bullish price action will be seen in MKR’s near future.   Monthly performance: +167 percent
All-time high: $0.31
Closing price February 28: $0.1414
Market capitalization February 28: $123.8 million Theta token dominated the mid-cap segment this month, boasting a 167 percent rise to close out February as one of the top performing cryptocurrencies in the entire market.  The nearest mid-cap contender to Theta’s impressive showing was Ontology (ONT) which stood at 64.1 percent over the 28-day period. Theta is an open-source protocol that enables a decentralized streaming network which, in partnership with SLIVER.tv, offer esports entertainment, peer-to-peer streaming and allows for decentralized apps (dapps) to be built on top of the platform. It could be speculated that the majority of Theta’s bullish momentum is attributed to positive project developments within the Theta ecosystem. For instance, It’s likely investors have been and still are pricing in Theta’s airdrop of Theta Fuel tokens set to occur on March 12 and its upcoming mainnet launch on March 15. While Theta’s recent technical price developments are undoubtedly bullish, including its breaking of a 9-month downtrend and printing its first positive value on the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) since June, investors may want to proceed with caution as the price is now overextended on the smaller time frames and is at risk of witnessing a “sell the news” reaction.  Monthly performance: +180 percent
All-time high: $0.49
Closing price February 28: $0.08201
Market capitalization February 28: $62.5 million Enjin Coin (ENJ), the cryptocurrency for virtual goods powered by Enjin, saw a 180 percent increase in February’s to conclude the month atop the list of the best performances by small-cap coins. Not only that, ENJ was able to record its most trading volume in a single month of 244 million, which is a total roughly four times than its entire market capitalization.  The reason for ENJ’s significant price boost is easier to pinpoint than the other cryptocurrencies, largely due to the fact ENJ surged over 190 percent from Feb. 25 to Feb. 26 on the back of a rumored partnership with tech giant Samsung.  While the partnership is not yet confirmed, ENJ’s price chart has indeed broken its bearish trend on the high time frames. As can be seen above, February monthly candlestick has set a higher price high above multi-month resistance levels, effectively shifting the trend from bearish to bullish favor.  Price will now look to close on a monthly basis above the next significant resistance level of $0.10 in order to provide confirmation of more upside.   Monthly performance: +43 percent
All-time high: $4.56
Closing price on February 28: $0.89
Market capitalization February 28: $8.49 million Metronome (MET) outperformed all cryptocurrencies with a market cap below $10 million in February, boasting a 44.38 percent price increase. The next best performer in the micro-capp segment, Numariarire (NMR) came a close second with a 41 percent increase on the month of Feb.  MET didn’t set any notable trading volume records or witness any outlier single day performances as its price increase was gradual throughout the entire month, but was able to break its weekly bearish trend by setting a high above the previous swing high of roughly $0.97. There is reason for caution, however, since there was no increase in volume upon the change in trend. This could be seen as a false breakout without proper validation from an increase in trading volumes.

" Bitcoin is heading into a historically weak month on a positive note and could see gains if resistance at $4,190 is breached. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization has had a tough time in the final month of the first quarter for the last five years. Prices fell 15.7, 4, 4.9, 9.3 and 32 percent in the month of March from 2014 through 2018, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. This time, however, March may turn out to be a good month, especially if the early signs of bullish reversal seen in February yield quick progress to levels above the crucial resistance of $4,190 in the next week or two. Further, BTC has posted gains in February in the previous four years and is all set to extend that winning streak to the fifth year with 10 percent gains. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,820, having defended key support of $3,700 yesterday. !function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"")}})}();   On the 3-day chart, BTC has bounced up from the ascending 10-candle moving average (MA), reinforcing the bullish view put forward by that MA. Further, both the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) histogram and the Chaikin money flow (CMF) are printing bullish above zero. Meanwhile, the daily chart shows the cryptocurrency has defended the former resistance-turned-support of the upper edge of the triangle pattern with a long-tailed doji – a sign of dip demand. As a result, a re-test of $4,000 could be on the cards. A violation there would expose the next major resistance lined up at $4,190.  The inverted bullish hammer seen in the weekly chart suggests the bulls are beginning to test the bears’ resolve to keep prices lower – a sign the market is bottoming out. That said, a bullish reversal would be confirmed only if prices end the current week (Sunday, UTC close) or the next week above the hammer’s high of $4,190. That would validate the bullish divergence of the MACD and the relative strength index’s (RSI) upside break of the falling trendline and allow a stronger rally toward $4,833 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from November highs to December lows). However, an inability to produce quick gains above $4,190 would shift focus back to the primary bearish trend, as seen on the monthly chart, and would shift risk in favor of a drop to recent lows below $3,400.

" View Bitcoin (BTC) looks set to end its record six-month losing streak with modest gains in February. The crypto market leader is currently trading at $3,800 on Bitstamp, representing a 10 percent gain on the monthly opening price of $3,434, according to CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Had BTC remained bid at highs above $4,100 seen over the weekend, the monthly gain would have been close to 20 percent. Nevertheless, a 10 percent rise – assuming prices stay at $3,800 till UTC close tomorrow – will be the first positive monthly performance since July. Prices dropped 9, 6, 4.4, 37, 7 and 7.5 percent, respectively, in the previous six months, the longest stretch of monthly losses on record. Notably, November’s double-digit drop did the most damage, with prices tumbling below the long-held support of $6,000 and dashing hopes of a long-term bullish reversal from that level. The sell-off, however, ran out of steam near $3,300 in the last two months, allowing BTC to post a notable bounce in the historically positive month of February. More importantly, as we enter the final month of the first quarter, signs of bearish exhaustion have emerged on longer duration charts, as discussed earlier this week. BTC, therefore, could remain better bid in March – a weak month for the leading cryptocurrency since 2014. A green candle has appeared on the monthly chart after six months in the red. The trend, however, is still to the downside, as indicated by the downward sloping 5- and 10-month moving averages (MAs). A break above the descending trendline connecting the December 2017 and November 2018 highs is needed to invalidate the bearish view.  On the above chart, the 50-week MA has dropped below the 100-week MA for the first time since early 2015. That long-term bearish crossover is widely considered a lagging indicator. Further, historical data shows the previous bear market ended with the bear cross of the same two averages. Further, the cryptocurrency created an inverted bullish hammer last week, validating the seller exhaustion signaled by the long-term MA crossover. BTC, therefore, may remain on the offensive next month.  BTC created a bearish outside reversal (engulfing) candle yesterday, countering the bullish outside reversal created in three days to Feb. 8. A bullish-to-bearish reversal, however, would be confirmed only if BTC finds acceptance under $3,714. That looks unlikely, as the 10-candle MA, currently placed just below $3,700, is trending north and could recharge engines for a re-test of $4,000.

" Bitcoin risks a further sell-off if the bulls’ defense of $3,700 fails to produce quick recovery. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization created a big bearish outside reversal candle on Feb. 24, weakening the bullish case put forward by last week’s high-volume breakout above $3,800. The sell-off was likely driven by the unwinding of long positions (profit taking), as the notional value of short positions fell 12 percent to 11-month lows, according to Bitfinex. Notably, the long-short ratio is still holding near the high of 1.5 seen earlier this month, signaling bullish market sentiment. Further, the bullish higher low of $3,550 set on Feb. 17 is intact. Therefore, the path of least resistance is still to the higher side. So far, however, the bulls have not taken advantage of better entry levels offered by Sunday’s price drop, leaving the cryptocurrency directionless around $3,800. So an upward move is needed soon, as the short duration technical studies are turning bearish and a break below $3,700 could yield deeper losses. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,800 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  BTC seems to have carved out a bear flag on the hourly chart, which often ends up accelerating the preceding bearish move. An hourly close below $3,764 – the confluence of the lower edge of the flag and the rising trendline – would confirm a flag breakdown and, with RSI back in the undersold territory (50-30), there is enough room for a drop to levels below $3,400 post-breakdown. The chart also shows a bearish crossover between the 50- and 200-hour MAs, which would gain credence if the cryptocurrency fails to pick up a strong bid in the next few hours.  A UTC close below $3,714 would validate both the downward sloping 100-day moving average (MA) and Sunday’s bearish outside day candle and confirm a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change. That could be followed by a drop to $3,531, a bullish higher low carved out on Feb. 14. The probability of BTC witnessing a bearish close below $3,714 would rise if prices confirm a flag breakdown with a move below $3,764 in the next few hours.

" The number of short bets placed against the price of bitcoin on at least one notable exchange declined to their lowest total in 11 months on Sunday. Data from Bitfinex shows that bitcoin’s 8 percent drop in price on Sunday was accompanied by a 12 percent drop in the notional value of open short positions, with the total amount of such trades dropping from a daily high of 19,604 to 17,085 BTC, the lowest amount allocated on the platform since March 12 of last year. The development comes just a week after the total value tied up in all short trades on the exchange reached a six-month low, one of a number of signs that would suggest investors are losing confidence in the idea that bitcoin’s price will further decrease. Still, the market has appeared inconclusive in its reading of what would appear to be positive indicators. Up until 3:00 UTC on Sunday, bitcoin was boasting a near 15 percent week-over-week price increase, but it ended just 3 percent higher as a result of Sunday’s sell-off, according to pricing data from CoinDesk.  When such a harsh rejection from a key technical resistance occurs, strengthened bearish sentiment can usually be quantified by an increase in the total amount of funds allocated to BTC/USD short positions, or bets that profit from future declines in price, yet the developments on Sunday contradicted this notion.  At the same time, the bitcoin-denominated value of all BTC/USD long positions on Bitfinex Sunday fell to just 26,433, which was less than 1 percent lower than it started.  As a result, that lack of short interest following the considerable drop in bitcoin’s price is more likely a sign of investors taking profit after the bullish start to the week rather than fresh selling hitting the market. What’s more, the ratio of the total BTC/USD long to short positions on Bitfinex currently reads 1.43 to 1, making it clear the drop has not completely scared off those favoring a near-term bullish outlook.

" Bitfinex has announced that some of the bitcoins stolen in a major 2016 hack have been returned after they were retrieved by the U.S. government. In a blog post published Monday, the exchange said that 27.66270285 BTC – worth just over $104,000 at time of writing – have been received from the U.S. government, and come as the result of U.S. law enforcement efforts. Bitfinex said that, since the hack, it has been collaborating with international law enforcement agencies “to provide intelligence and assist with investigations,” adding: “Bitfinex was alerted in November 2018 that the U.S. government had obtained bitcoins believed to be proceeds from the 2016 hack.” The August 2016 hack, in which a total of 119,756 BTC were stolen, shocked the crypto market with the largest loss of bitcoins by an exchange since Japan’s Mt. Gox huge breach in early 2014. The returned funds represent about 0.023 percent of the total taken in the attack. As pledged in its recovery strategy formulated after the 2016 breach, the returned funds are being converted to U.S. dollars and will be paid to current holders of its RRT (Recovery Right Token) token. To compensate for the hack losses in 2016, the exchange generalized the losses across all accounts and credited BFX tokens to customers at a ratio of 1 BFX to every dollar stolen. “Within eight months of the security breach, all BFX token holders had their tokens redeemed at 100 cents on the dollar or exchanged their tokens for, directly or indirectly, shares of the capital stock of iFinex Inc. All BFX tokens were destroyed within this process,” Bitfinex said in Monday’s post. Bitfinex created the tradable RRT token for BFX holders allowing them to convert BFX tokens into shares of iFinex, it added. After any outstanding or unconverted BFX token holders have been reimbursed, as per the recovery plan, recovered funds were set to be distributed to RRT holders, up to 1 dollar per RRT. “As all BFX tokens have been redeemed and destroyed, the full amount of recovered bitcoins today is being distributed pro rata to the RRT holders,” Btfinex stated. Thanking the U.S. federal law enforcement agencies for their efforts in investigating the attack and returning the stolen funds, Giancarlo Devasini, chief financial officer at Bitfinex, said: “Over two years following the hack of the Bitfinex platform, today we see the results of a clear and robust response strategy and the efforts of the U.S. government. It gives us great pleasure to be able to reimburse our traders that were loyal to us and believed in us at a very difficult time.” The exchange, he continued, will continue to assist law enforcement with their inquiries. With much of the stolen bitcoin still missing, Devasini called for the hackers, or anyone with information about the breach, to make contact “to finally resolve the situation in a mutually beneficial manner.” Correction: This article previously incorrectly stated the percentage of the total bitcoins that have been returned. This has now been corrected. Bitfinex image via Shutterstock",2019-02-25
" Bitcoin (BTC) nosedived overnight, clouding the interim bullish outlook, and a deeper drop could unfold if key support near $3,700 is breached. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose to highs near $4,200 in the Asian trading hours yesterday, as expected, only to fall back to levels below $3,800 by UTC close. That 9.31 percent slide is the biggest single-day drop since Jan. 11. Notably, trading volumes across all cryptocurrency exchanges totaled $10.79 billion on Sunday – the highest since April 25, 2018, according to CoinMarketCap. The high-volume sell-off erased gains seen over the previous five days, thereby weakening the bullish case put forward by last Monday’s break above $3,800. That said, a bullish-to-bearish trend change would be confirmed only if the sell-off seen yesterday is extended to levels below $3,700. Further, the losses following a potential bearish reversal could be short-lived, as signs of seller exhaustion have emerged on longer duration charts. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,780 on Bitstamp, representing a 7.78 percent drop on a 24-hour basis. As seen above, BTC created a widely-followed candlestick pattern called “bearish outside-day” yesterday – invalidating the triangle breakout seen on Feb. 18. A bearish reversal would be confirmed if prices close today (UTC) below $3,714 (Sunday’s low). That could yield a drop toward the recent lows below $3,400.  The probability of BTC closing today below $3,714 would rise if the pennant pattern seen on the 4-hour chart is breached to the downside. A break below the lower edge of the pennant, currently at $3,740, would confirm a breakdown and could be followed by a sell-off to $3,360 (target as per the measured move method). BTC, however, may rise back to $4,000 if the pennant is breached to the higher side.  The inverted hammer seen in the above chart indicates that the buyers managed to eke out gains last week despite the sell on the rise mentality. Put simply, the bulls are beginning to test bear’s strength, which is a sign the market is bottoming out. As a result, sellers need to be cautious even if prices break below $3,700 today, as the ensuing losses could be short-lived.

" A lagging indicator has turned bearish for the first time in four years, suggesting bitcoin’s price may have bottomed out and that a new bull run could begin this year. As of press time, bitcoin’s 50-week moving average has dropped below the 100-week MA, confirming a bearish crossover – the first since April 2015. Long-term bearish crossovers, however, tend to occur at the end of a big bear move, with prices rallying soon after, as MAs are based on past data. For instance, the 50-week MA responds to price action seen over the last 12 months, and the 100-week MA tracks much older data. Therefore, the bearish cross of the two is the product of a prolonged bear market – BTC dropped from $20,000 to $3,122 in the 12 months ending December 2018. Put simply, it takes a great effort on the part of the bears to push the 50-week MA below the 100-week MA. As a result, the bear market is usually exhausted by the time the crossover is confirmed, which seems to be the case with BTC. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $3,749, up more than 19 percent from the lows near $3,100 seen 11 weeks ago. Further, bitcoin’s historical data shows the previous bear market ended with the 50-week MA falling below the 100-week MA in April 2015.   As seen above, the 50-week MA fell below the 100-week MA in April 2015 – three months after the bear market stalled at lows near $150.  The cryptocurrency spent the following five months consolidating in a range of $200-$300 before breaking higher into a fresh bull market in October 2015. Interestingly, all this happened a year before bitcoin underwent its second mining reward halving in July 2016. With the third reward halving due in less than 12 months, history looks to be repeating itself.  The latest bearish crossover has happened nearly three months after the sell-off from December 2017 highs ran out of steam near $3,100.  The relative strength index (RSI) has breached the falling trendline, warning the bear cross could trap sellers on the wrong side of the market. Further, the cryptocurrency is now looking north, having witnessed a high-volume bullish breakout last week. So, there is a strong possibility that BTC will begin a new bull run later this year by violating the bearish lower highs pattern, as represented by the trendline sloping downwards from December 2017 highs.

" Bitcoin’s price climbed back above $4,000 on Saturday for the first time in over two months as the broader cryptocurrency market flashed green. At 18:00 UTC on Saturday, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization surpassed the $4,000 mark to ultimately reach $4,146 – its highest price since Dec. 24 of last year, according to pricing data from CoinDesk.  Bitcoin’s price has since pulled back slightly, now trading at $4,104, but current figures still represent a considerable 20 percent increase since the beginning of the month.  Bitcoin is usually accompanied by the broader cryptocurrency market when its picks up a strong bid and the developments on Saturday were no exception.  As a result, many other well known cryptocurrencies we able to record notable gains. Names like NEO, QTUM, and NEM have all appreciated more than 9 percent in the past 24-hours.  Meanwhile, lesser known cryptocurrencies out of the world’s 100 largest are flashing even more impressive price growth, including NEXO and S4FE (S4F), who are up 24 and 78 percent at press time, according to data from Coinmarketcap. The capitalization of the entire cryptocurrency market has increased 16 percent over the past seven days to reach it highest value in over eight weeks of $141 billion. Also of note, the global weekly cryptocurrency trading volume is currently registering $176 billion, which is its most in a single week since the first week in May of 2018, Coinmarketcap data further reveals.

" Bitcoin’s three-day price consolidation looks to be a bull breather before a continuation of the recent rally to above $4,000. The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading largely unchanged on the day at $3,920 on Bitstamp. Notably, prices are trapped in a narrowing price of $4,000 to $3,860 for the third consecutive day. As a result, traders may feel tempted to question the reliability of the high-volume triangle breakout, confirmed on Monday. The bearish-to-bullish trend change, however, will remain valid as long as prices are held above $3,614, as discussed yesterday. Trading volumes have dropped 43 percent from the nine-month high of $9.93 billion seen on Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap. So, the pullback from highs near $4,000 to $3,900 is likely nothing more than temporary bullish exhaustion. Further, BTC seems to have created a bull flag pattern – a pause which often refreshes on the higher side – on the technical charts. Therefore, the cryptocurrency could soon pick up a strong bid and rise above $4,000.  A 4-hour close above the upper edge of the flag, currently at $3,930, would confirm a bull flag breakout and open the doors to $4,330 (target as per the measured move method). The RSI, currently at 63, is again reporting bullish conditions, as opposed to overbought readings seen three days ago. Major averages – 50, 100 and 200 – are also trending north indicating a bullish setup.  On the daily chart, BTC has bounced upwards at the ascending 5-day moving average (MA), reinforcing the bullish view put forward by the short-term MA studies. A high-volume break above $4,000 would bolster the already bullish technical setup and allow a rally to December highs above $4,200. A less-likely close below Monday’s low of $3,614 would abort the bullish view. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" A much-followed bitcoin (BTC) price indicator has turned bullish for the first time in seven months, indicating a trend change in the market. On the three-day chart, the 5-candle exponential moving average (EMA) has crossed the 10-candle EMA from below – the first decisive bullish crossover since July 17, 2018. Back then, BTC was trading above $7,300 and the crossover was followed by a rally to highs above $8,400 on July 24. Moving average crossovers help identify shifts in momentum. A bearish-to-bullish trend change is confirmed when a short-term moving average crosses through a long-term average from below. Many would argue that EMA crossovers are lagging indicators. While that is true, crossovers between the short duration averages help traders distinguish between bullish and bearish scenarios. The long-term MA crossovers like the “golden cross” (bullish crossover of the 50-and 200-day MAs) often work as contrary indicators. The latest positive crossover seen in the three-day chart validates the bullish break above $3,800 witnessed earlier this week. As a result, December highs above $4,200 could soon be put to the test. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,894 on Bitstamp, having clocked a high of $3,990 earlier today.  As seen above (left), the 5- and 10-day EMAs have produced a decisive bullish crossover, i.e. the averages are trending north following the bull cross. The chart to the right shows July’s bullish cross. After a brief rally following the cross, the averages became flat-lined in the three months up to Nov. 14, offering little directional bias. In the current scenario, BTC’s last three-day candle closed at $3,936, confirming a triangle breakout, which also indicates a bearish-to-bullish trend change. Further, the candle closed well above $3,711, validating the bullish outside reversal created in the three days to Feb. 15. Even so, December highs above $4,200 may not come into play immediately, as the short duration charts have turned bearish.  The long upper shadows attached to multiple candles on the 4-hour chart signal bullish exhaustion near $4,000. The relative strength index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart has also rolled over from the overbought territory and is pointing southwards. Meanwhile, the RSI on the hourly chart has turned bearish below 50.00. As a result, BTC could revisit $3,800, before resuming the rally toward $4,236 (Dec. 24 high), as suggested by the three-day chart. The stacking order of the 50-hour MA, above the 100-hour MA, above the 200-hour MA, also indicates that any dip to $3,800 could be short-lived.

" Bitcoin (BTC) could revisit December highs above $4,200 in the near-term as the recent rally is backed by a surge in trading volumes. The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $3,930 on Bitstamp, having clocked a 5.5-week high of $4,000 yesterday. The 20 percent appreciation witnessed over the last 12 days is accompanied by a 28.4 percent rise in daily trading volumes, according to CoinMarketCap. Notably, total trading volumes across all exchanges jumped 40 percent to $9.91 billion on Monday, validating BTC’s bullish breakout above $3,800. Further, investor interest in the cryptocurrency has increased post-breakout, with volumes rising further to $9.93 billion yesterday – the highest level since May 3, 2018. So, the recent rally appears to have substance and prices could rise towards $4,236 (Dec. 24 high) in the near-term.  Both the inverse head-and-shoulders breakout and the triangle breakout seen in the above chart indicate a bearish-to-bullish trend change. The 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are trending north, indicating a short-term bullish setup. The 50-day MA has bottomed out (shed bearish bias) and the 100-day MA hurdle has been scaled. While the path of least resistance is to the higher side, a rise toward the Dec. 24 high of $4,236 may not happen immediately. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has moved into overbought territory above 70.00, while the long upper shadow attached to the previous day’s candle is sending a similar message.  On the 4-hour chart, the RSI is reporting overbought conditions and has diverged in favor of the bears (does not mirror the higher price highs) However, the stacking order of the 50-candle MA, above the 100-candle MA, above the 200-candle MA is a classic bullish indicator. So, pullbacks, if any, could be short-lived – especially as the longer duration charts are looking increasingly bullish.  BTC’s current 3-day candle looks set to close well above $3,711. That would add credence to the bullish outside reversal candle created in three-days to Feb. 8 and bring potential for a move towards $4,429 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from November highs to December lows). Supporting that scenario are a bullish crossover between the 5- and 10-day MAs, confirmed earlier this month, and an RSI of 51.00.

" The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may make an initial decision on not one, but two different bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETFs) proposals by April 5. A bitcoin ETF proposal submitted (for a second time) by VanEck, SolidX and the Cboe BZX Exchange is expected to be formally published in the Federal Register Wednesday, kicking off the initial 45-day clock for approval, rejection or extension. The proposal was first posted on the SEC’s website on Feb. 13. Once the proposal is officially published, the general public will have three weeks from Feb. 20 (meaning until March 13) to file their initial responses to it. Then the SEC will have another three weeks, until April 5, to make a decision or give itself an extension. At the moment, the proposal appears in the Public Inspection section of the Federal Register website, meaning it has not yet been officially published. As the current page notes, “only official editions of the Federal Register provide legal notice to the public and judicial notice to the courts,” while the most recent version of the proposal itself says that it is scheduled to be published Wednesday. The VanEck/SolidX proposal will join one filed by Bitwise Investment Management and NYSE Arca, which was published in the Federal Register on Feb. 15, meaning the SEC has until the beginning of April to decide on it or postpone the decision. The VanEck/SolidX proposal was previously filed last year, and was widely expected to be the first proposal to be approved by the U.S. securities regulator. However, this proposal was withdrawn during the longest U.S. government shutdown in history and re-filed at the end of January. If approved, an ETF could potentially bring new liquidity into a bitcoin market that is starting to show signs of recovery. However, it’s important to remember that the SEC can give itself up to three extensions on any rule change proposal, meaning it could still be months before a final decision is reached on either ETF. While the formal comment period has not officially opened yet, the VanEck/SolidX proposal is already receiving feedback. The filing’s first response, listed as from Sam Ahn at Hana Trading, asks how the companies are defining bitcoin’s intrinsic value. The question of intrinsic value is important for investors who may consider buying into the ETF, Ahn explains. Ahn’s response links to seven previous responses on different ETF proposals, all of which also question bitcoin’s intrinsic value. Gabor Gurbacs, VanEck’s digital asset strategy lead, declined to comment on this response. Correction (03:50 UTC, Feb. 20, 2019): This article previously said the Bitwise proposal was filed last year. The VanEck/SolidX proposal was first filed in 2018.

" The amount of money allocated to short bets against bitcoin fell to a more than 6-month low during Tuesday’s trading session, data from the popular cryptocurrency trading platform Bitfinex reveals. At 13:00 UTC today, the total funding in BTC shorts, or positions that would profit from a decline in the price of the underlying bitcoin asset, fell beyond the recent low of 18,992 BTC set this past November to reach 18,888 BTC – the lowest amount seen since Aug. 4, 2018. The development comes a day after bitcoin’s price increased 8 percent, which likely trapped investors with a bearish outlook on the wrong side of the market, causing them to cover a large number of short positions. Current figures show a 28 percent drop in the amount of funds in bitcoin shorts since the beginning of the day yesterday.  Interestingly, bullish bets on Bitfinex, known as “longs,” have also witnessed a sharp decline in the past 48 hours. Data from Bitfinex further reveals the amount of BTC/USD longs have dropped by a similar 29 percent from yesterday’s high, which is likely a sign of investors are deleveraging, or taking profit after bitcoin’s near 18 percent price increase over the past 11 days. As it stands, the ratio of long to short positions is 1.42 to 1, meaning there are 1.42 BTC in a long position per every 1 BTC is a short position on Bitfinex. The ratio is a slight decline from the most recent high of 1.54 to 1 set on Feb. 15. As previous analysis from CoinDesk notes, an unusually high long/short ratio can be a sign of an impending “long squeeze,” or rapid covering of long positions which increases the rate at which price declines. However, the current ratio of 1.42 is lower than both the ratio of 1.8 to 1 set in August and the all-time high ratio of 3.74 to 1 set in February of 2018.

" Bullish bets on bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by value, reached 11-month highs on Monday, according to the data from the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. The number of long positions on bitcoin’s US dollar-denominated exchange rate (BTC/USD) jumped to 38,237 BTC at 04:10 BTC – the highest level since March 30, 2018 – and were last seen at 36,176 BTC. While long positions have risen by 35 percent in the last three weeks, short positions have remained largely unchanged. As a result, the long-short ratio, a barometer of market sentiment, has improved to 1.5 from 1.18. The market mood has indeed turned bullish but hasn’t reached extremes, as long positions are still at least 8 percent short of the record high of 40,193 registered on March 26, 2018. That said, BTC’s rally to 5.5-week highs above $3,900 has likely opened the doors to a convincing move above $4,000. That would only attract buyers, pushing BTC/USD longs to fresh record highs. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,912 on Bitfinex, the highest level since Jan. 10. The cryptocurrency would become vulnerable to “long squeeze” –  a sudden pullback in prices due to an unwinding of long positions – if and when the bullish sentiment reaches extremes.

" Bitcoin’s high-volume move to one-month highs could be the start of a stronger rally to above key resistance near $3,760. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose to $3,727 at 07:00 UTC, the highest level since Jan. 19, according to Bitstamp data, validating Friday’s falling wedge breakout. With a move to levels above $3,700, bitcoin has also witnessed an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on the 4-hour chart – indicating a bearish-to-bullish trend change – and has opened up upside toward $4,000. On the way higher, however, BTC could encounter stiff resistance near $3,760 – the upper edge of a contracting triangle (higher lows and lower highs) carved out over the last eight weeks. A failure to take out that hurdle would weaken the short-term bullish case. That said, BTC is likely to cross that resistance this week, as the rally to one-month highs is backed by a pickup in both trading volumes and long positions (bullish bets). Bitcoin’s 24-hour trading volume has jumped to highs above $8 billion for the first time since Dec. 20, according to CoinMarketCap data. Further, BTC/USD longs on Bitfinex rose to 38,237 BTC earlier today – the highest level since March 30, 2018. Notably, long positions are still down at least 7 percent from record highs above 40,000 BTC witnessed in March last year. Therefore, the probability of a “long-squeeze” – a sudden price drop due to the unwinding of long positions – is quite low. So, the odds of BTC confirming the contracting triangle breakout with a move above $3,760 appear high. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $3,700 on Bitstamp, representing a 3 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  A bearish-to-bullish trend change on the daily chart would be confirmed if prices see a UTC close above the upper edge of the symmetrical triangle, currently at $3,760. That looks likely as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is currently located at 61.00, the highest level since September. Further, the 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are trending north indicating a bullish setup.  The inverse head-and-shoulders breakout seen in the 4-hour chart indicates scope for a rally to $4,030 (target as per the measured height method). Key averages are beginning to align in favor of the bulls too. The 50-candle MA is now sloping upwards and the 100-candle MA looks set to cross the 200-candle MA from below forming a bullish crossover. The RSI, however, is reporting overbought conditions. Hence, a minor bout of consolidation or pullback could be seen before the contracting triangle resistance at $3,760 is breached.

" Calling precise market tops and bottoms is next to impossible in the volatile cryptocurrency markets. That said, some traders believe identifying speculative bubbles and moments of bearish exhaustion can be made possible through the use of a fairly new metric known as the Mayer Multiple. Created by noted investor and podcast host Trace Mayer, the Mayer Multiple is defined as “the multiple of the current bitcoin price over the 200-day moving average.” Mayer Multiple Formula: Bitcoin market price / 200 day MA value = Mayer Multiple In technical analysis, it’s generally considered a bullish (or positive) indicator when prices are above the long-term moving average (MA), whereas it’s considered bearish (or negative), when the price is below the moving average.  However, the implications are not that binary. For example, if the price is significantly higher than a long-term moving average, it’s often a sign that the underlying asset has become overvalued or what is commonly referred to as “overbought.” The opposite is the case when the price falls excessively below the moving average. The Mayer Multiple essentially quantifies the gap between the price and 200-day MA to identify historical values at which point bitcoin enters a speculative bubble. In other words: when its price significantly exceeds its intrinsic value or points of seller exhaustion.   When using Mayer Multiple, the two specific values to pay keen attention to are 1 and 2.4. The significance of a 1 multiple is simple: any value above 1 means bitcoin’s price has risen above the 200-day MA and any value below 1 means price has fallen beneath it.  By comparing multiples below 1 to its corresponding price action, it is evident that extensive bear markets take place when price finds acceptance below the 200 MA. On the other hand, bitcoin’s market favors the bulls when the Mayer Multiple is above 1 – but there’s an exception.   Any multiple above the 2.4 threshold has historically shown to signify the beginning of a speculative bubble, which is significant because all bubbles eventually burst, causing a rapid depreciation. By conducting simulations based on historical data, Mayer deduced that the best long-term results were gathered by accumulating bitcoin when the Mayer Multiple was below 2.4. As can also be seen above, the Mayer Multiple has never fallen below 0.237, the value that marked the bottom of bitcoin’s first significant bear market in 2011.  For reference, the 2013-15 bear market reached a price bottom when the multiple showed 0.407 and the lowest multiple since then was 0.509, when bitcoin’s price fell to $3,122 on Dec. 15, according to CoinDesk pricing data.  As the data suggests, bitcoin’s price is now reaching historically oversold levels so its presumed a bottom is in sight, but is still capable of falling further away from the 200-day MA, which is currently sitting at $5,343. Further, evidence suggests that it’s highly likely the price finding acceptance above the 200-day MA, creating a Mayer Multiple above 1, would confirm the beginning of a bull market.  An above-1 Mayer Multiple could be considered a sign of a bull market. A very high number represents extreme overbought conditions or bubble. BTC, therefore, could see a corrective pullback or an outright sell-off, in which case prices may eventually drop below the 200-day MA, driving the Mayer Multiple below 1. However, that could turn out to be a bear trap, as a sharp drop from extreme overbought conditions to levels below 200-day MA is usually accompanied by short-term overbought conditions. An unusually low number could be considered an advance indicator of bitcoin nearing a major bottom. Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, ZIL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) six days in the doldrums has weakened the bull case in the short term, leaving a target of $3,700 for a resumed rally. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization was expected to make a quick move to the psychological resistance of $4,000, having witnessed a falling wedge breakout last Friday on the back of strong volumes. BTC, however, has remained directionless near $3,600 in the last six days and is currently trading largely unchanged on the day at $3,570 on Bitstamp. So weak has been the follow through to the wedge breakout that prices have failed to challenge even the highs above $3,700 seen last Friday. The immediate outlook, therefore, is neutral and $3,711 (Feb. 8 high) is the new level to beat for the bulls. A convincing move above that resistance would put the focus back on the high volume falling wedge breakout and open the doors for a stronger corrective rally. The bears may feel tempted to hit the market with fresh offers if the sideways action continues over the weekend, which could push price toward $3,400.  BTC created a bullish outside reversal candle on Feb. 8, meaning the price action seen during that three-day period engulfed the highs and lows of the preceding three days. As the name implies, that candlestick is widely considered an early sign of bullish reversal. The trend change, however, is only confirmed after prices find acceptance above the high of that candlestick pattern. A move above $3,711 (Feb. 8 high) would confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and open the doors to levels above $4,000.  On the 4-hour chart, BTC is currently trading above the upper edge of the falling wedge – a breakout indicating a resumption of the rally from lows below $3,400 seen on Feb. 8. The positive move means BTC could confirm the bullish outside reversal with a move above $3,711 over the weekend. The bears will likely capitalize and drive prices back toward $3,400 if the breakout fails and prices move below $3,531 (wedge low).

" A long-term price indicator validates a growing consensus among investors that bitcoin (BTC) is close to bottoming out. BTC fell below $6,000 on Nov. 14, dashing hopes of a long-term bullish reversal from that long-held psychological support. The subsequent sell-off came to a halt near $3,100 in December – 18 months ahead of the mining reward halving – triggering speculation that the cryptocurrency could bottom out in 2019. It is worth noting that BTC created a long-term bottom in January 2015 before undergoing a reward halving in July 2016. While investors are betting that history will repeat itself, bitcoin’s corrective rally from December lows is struggling to pick up the pace. That, however, could change in the near future, as the bitcoin’s moving average convergence divergence (MACD) – a momentum indicator based upon price moving averages – is signaling waning bearish pressures. The MACD  usually moves in the direction of the price trend and indicates the strength of a move. Bitcoin’s weekly MACD, however, has diverged from the primary bearish trend, i.e. the price hit a lower low near $3,100 in December, while the MACD carved out a higher low. A bullish divergence is widely considered a sign of seller exhaustion and is often followed by trend reversal. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,570 on Bitstamp, having hit highs above $3,700 last week. On the weekly chart, the MACD has produced a higher low in favor of the bulls. It is worth noting that a similar bullish divergence was charted over the five months leading up to January 2015, when BTC bottomed out near $150. So, there is a reason to believe the cryptocurrency is nearing, or has already reached, a major bottom. As a result, the probability of BTC witnessing a bullish reversal in the next few months is high. A convincing move above the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) – a level which acted as strong support last year – would confirm a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change. As of writing, that average is located at $5,334. Meanwhile, the prospects of a short-term rally to $4,000 would improve if BTC clears the resistance at $3,735.  BTC has carved out a falling wedge pattern – a bullish continuation pattern – on the 4-hour chart. A move above $3,585 would confirm a wedge breakout and could yield a rally to $3,735, which is the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern. A violation there would open up upside toward $4,100 (target as per the measured move method). A wedge breakdown, however, would weaken the bullish case put forward by last Friday’s high-volume bullish breakout and shift risk in favor of a drop to $3,400.

" Bitcoin’s struggle to cross a key moving average lined up above $3,600 is a cause of concern for the bulls. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $3,575 on Bitstamp, having faced rejection at the widely followed 50-day moving average (MA) hurdle at $3,629 earlier today. Notably, that average line has been capping upside since Friday, countering expectations of a quick move toward $4,000 built following the high-volume falling wedge breakout. The sideways action below the 50-day MA has also invalidated the bull flag pattern created on the 4-hour chart over the last three days. So, the bullish case appears to have weakened and the probability of a drop to levels below $3,400 would rise if the 50-day MA hurdle remains intact for another 24 hours.  As seen above, the odds are stacked in favor of the bulls: the 5- and 10-day MAs are trending north, validating the falling wedge breakout. The 14-day RSI is reporting bullish conditions above 50.00. Even so, BTC is struggling to find acceptance above the 50-day MA, currently at $3,629. As a result, the bears may feel tempted to hit the market with fresh offers, driving the prices down to the ascending 10-day MA at $3,521. It is worth noting that the 50-day MA had worked as stiff resistance multiple times in the second half of the last month. As a result, a convincing move above that average is needed to revive the short-term bullish outlook.  BTC is likely creating the right shoulder of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the 4-hour chart. A break above the neckline resistance, currently at $3,730, would confirm a bullish breakout and could be followed by a move higher to $4,130 (target as per the measured move method). So, while a break above the 50-day MA would revive the bullish outlook, only an acceptance above the neckline hurdle of $3,730 would put $4,000 back on the table.

" Bitcoin’s overnight pullback from three-week highs hit on Friday doesn’t mean the rally is over. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $3,560 on Bitstamp, having clocked a three-week high of $3,711 on Feb. 8. The 4 percent correction was preceded by repeated failures at the 50-day moving average (MA) resistance, currently at $3,633. Even so, the prospects of a stronger short-term rally toward $4,000 look strong, as the price pullback has carved out a bull flag on the technical charts. That pattern represents a pause, which often ends up extending the preceding bullish move. A break above the upper edge of the flag, currently at $3,630, would confirm a breakout and could be followed by a rally to $4,000 (length of the preceding bullish move added to the breakout price).  BTC’s move to highs above $3,700 on Friday confirmed a falling wedge breakout on the 4-hour chart. The short-term outlook, therefore, is bullish. Validating that positive development is a bull cross of the 50- and 100-candle moving averages. Put simply, the bulls appear to be in control and could soon force a flag breakout. It’s worth noting, though, if the bulls don’t act soon, then the flag’s horizontal length (duration) would exceed the pole’s height in the next few hours, deeming the bullish continuation setup invalid. The RSI has also dropped into bearish territory below 50 and the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) is close to turning negative. So, the bulls need progress soon to stop BTC finding acceptance below flag support at $3,546. That would shift risk in favor of a drop to $3,400.  On the daily chart, the 5- and 10-candle MAs are trending north, indicating a short-term bullish setup. A bull flag breakout, if confirmed, could yield a convincing move above the 50-candle MA – a level, which has acted as stiff resistance in the last 72 hours.

" Bitcoin (BTC) saw a high-volume bullish move Friday that may have opened the doors for a rally above $3,800. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization jumped to $3,711 on Feb. 8 – the highest level since Jan. 19 – and ended the day with a 7.8 percent gain, according to Bitstamp data. That’s the biggest single-day rise since Dec. 28 The rally to three-week highs confirmed an upside break of the falling wedge – a bullish reversal pattern carved out in the last five weeks. Notably, trading volumes jumped 54.6 percent to $7.73 billion on Friday, according to CoinMarketCap data. The rise represents the first time volume has passed $7 billion since Dec. 24 and the highest reading in nearly three months. Further, the three-day average of 24-hour trading volumes has jumped well above $6 billion for the first time since Dec. 25. The bullish breakout, therefore, looks to have legs and prices could soon crack the 50-day moving average (MA), which has has been serving as a strong resistance since Friday. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,595 on Bitstamp, representing an 8.2 percent gain on the January low of $3,322. The 50-day MA is currently located at $3,642. BTC’s jump to highs above $3,700 confirmed a falling wedge breakout, but failed to close above the 50-day MA, as per the daily chart. While that average hurdle, currently at $3,642, has capped upside in the last 48 hours, the strong volumes suggest it could be passed soon. Further, the 5- and 10-day MAs are trending north, having produced a bullish crossover over the weekend and the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is also reporting bullish conditions with an above-50 reading. As a result, BTC could soon rise toward $3,800 (Jan. 19 high) and possibly to the psychological resistance of $4,000.  A convincing break above the 50-candle MA on the 6-hour chart also supports the bullish reversal seen on the daily chart. Acting as resistance, the MA had blocked several attempted corrective rallies over the last three weeks.  BTC rose by 6.9 percent last week – the biggest weekly rise since mid-December – amid bearish exhaustion signaled by the slide in volumes in the last 10 weeks. The cryptocurrency closed last week above the 10-week MA, neutralizing the immediate bearish view. Further, the 5- and 10-week MAs have shed bearish bias (are flatlined).

" Bitcoin (BTC), which continues to languish near seven-week lows, is being outshone by a surge in litecoin prices. BTC, the world’s leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently trading at $3,390 on Bistamp and risks falling to December lows near $3,100, having charted bearish higher low at the crucial 6-hour chart 50-candle moving average (MA) this week. Meanwhile, litecoin, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is currently changing hands at $37.70 – a 12.7 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. LTC’s BTC-denominated exchange rate jumped to 0.011404 BTC on Binance earlier today marking the highest level since July 21, 2018. The rally looks sustainable, too, as trading volumes across exchanges have increased by 34 percent to $879 million in the last 24 hours. While the exact reason for double-digit gains is not clear, the cryptocurrency may have picked up a strong bid in reaction to the news that the Litecoin Foundation is in talks to implement privacy features for litecoin via the Mimblewimble protocol. So far, litecoin’s double-digit jump has not had a positive rub off on the broader market, and the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are still trading flat or with minor gains. The broader market sentiment, however, may improve if BTC responds to LTC rally by climbing the crucial resistance of the 6-hour chart 50-candle moving average (MA), currently located at $3,417. That would boost the odds of a corrective bounce toward the resistance at $3,658.  On the daily chart, LTC/BTC is trading well above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline level of 0.010182 BTC. A bull breakout would be confirmed if prices close today above that level. The inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern works best when it appears at the bottom of the sell-off, as is the case with LTC/BTC currently. Therefore, a breakout, if confirmed, could yield a rally to 0.0134 BTC (target as per the measured move method) – albeit after a minor bout of consolidation, as the 14-day relative strength index is reporting overbought conditions.  As seen above, the 5- and 10-week moving averages (MAs) are trending north, indicating a bullish setup. Further, the 14-week RSI is reporting bullish conditions with an above-50 reading. So, the probability of LTC confirming an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout is high. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" With bitcoin (BTC) closing yesterday at the lowest level in 7.5 weeks, the gradual sell-off is showing no signs of abating. On Wednesday, the leading cryptocurrency by market value ended the session (as per UTC) at $3,328 – the weakest daily close since Dec. 16 – according to Bitstamp data, dashing hopes of an upside break of the falling wedge pattern carved out over the last six weeks. Further, BTC created a bearish lower high at the crucial resistance of the 50-candle moving average (MA) on the 6-hour chart. That average line has thwarted several fledgling rallies over the last three weeks, as discussed yesterday. As a result, the slow drip sell-off from December highs above $4,200 witnessed over the last six weeks is likely to continue. BTC could soon challenge recent lows near $3,300 and may extend the decline toward the low of $3,100 seen in December. At press time, BTC is trading largely unchanged on the day at $3,380.  As seen above, yesterday’s high and low engulfed Tuesday’s price action as indicated by a bearish outside candle. Effectively, the day began with optimism but ended on a pessimistic note, meaning the “sell-on-rise” mentality is still strong. Hence, the cryptocurrency risks falling to the descending channel support, currently at $3,230. Supporting that bearish case are the 14-day relative strength index of 38 and downward sloping 20-day moving average (MA).  On the 6-hour chart, the 50-candle MA has proved a tough nut to crack for close to three weeks. A convincing break above that average, currently at $3,434, might lead to a stronger rally toward resistance at $3,658 (high of the bearish gravestone doji created Jan. 26).

" Bitcoin (BTC) price gains may be capped by a key moving average that has been acting as stiff resistance since mid-January. The leading cryptocurrency by market value jumped to $3,445 earlier today, confirming an upside break of a falling wedge – bullish reversal pattern – carved out over the last six weeks. The breakout failed, however, and BTC ended up charting a bearish lower high near the 50-candle moving average (MA) on the 6-hour chart. Notably, that average line has put the brakes on a number of attempted corrective rallies over the last three weeks. For instance, bitcoin’s quick recovery from lows near $3,400 on Jan. 22 had triggered hopes of a stronger recovery rally. That price bounce, however, failed to clear the 6-hour chart 50-candle MA for four days straight and the repeated bull failure was followed by a drop to $3,322 on Jan. 29. Hence, the bulls will likely feel emboldened if and when that MA hurdle is convincing scaled. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,367 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.6 percent drop on a 24-hour basis. The 50-candle MA on the 6-hour chart is seen at $3,450.  As seen above, BTC has charted bearish lower highs (red arrows) along the downward sloping (bearish) 50-candle MA over the last three weeks. What makes it a strong short-term resistance is that after every rejection the price has hit a bearish lower low. So, the probability of BTC printing fresh multi-week lows below the Jan. 29 low of $3,322 in the next day or two is high. After all, the cryptocurrency faced rejection at the 50-candle MA earlier today, invalidating the bullish view put forward by the falling wedge breakout. Also supporting the bearish case is the Bollinger band breakdown (acceptance below the lower band) and the relative strength index (RSI) of  35.00. Bearish pressures would possibly weaken following a convincing 6-hour close above the 50-candle MA at $3,450. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

" The current calm in the bitcoin (BTC) market is reminiscent of the lackluster trading witnessed in October. Bitcoin’s daily trading range, the spread between the highest and lowest prices, fell to $33 yesterday – the lowest since Oct. 31, according to CoinMarketCap data. On that date, the leading cryptocurrency had witnessed a daily trading range of $32. Back then, BTC was squeezed above $6,300 for four weeks leading up to Nov. 14, when the cryptocurrency dashed hopes of a long-term bullish reversal with a convincing break below the crucial support of $6,000. The latest bout of sideways trading below $3,500 is just seven days old and was preceded by a gradual sell-off from late December highs above $4,200. The odds of the consolidation ending with an upside move are high, as the cryptocurrency has charted a falling wedge – a bullish reversal pattern – on the daily chart. As of writing, BTC is trading largely unchanged on the day above $3,420 on Bitstamp.  On the daily chart, BTC is probing the upper edge of the falling wedge, currently at $3,430. A daily close (UTC) above that level would confirm a wedge breakout and allow a rally to $3,658 – the high of the bearish gravestone doji created on Jan. 26. A violation there would validate the wedge breakout and open up upside toward the psychological hurdle of $4,000.  As seen above, BTC cleared the lower edge of the channel yesterday in favor of the bears. Even so, the psychological support of $3,400 continues to hold ground, signaling seller exhaustion. Hence, BTC could well make a falling wedge breakout in the next 24 hours. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

" The slow drip bitcoin (BTC) price sell-off seen over the last six weeks has produced a bullish pattern on the daily chart. The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently down more than 20 percent from highs above $4,200 seen on Dec. 24. The pullback may have reinforced the primary bearish trend, as represented by the long-term moving average studies. Still, all is not lost for the bulls, as the lower highs and lower lows created over the last six weeks have converged, creating a downward sloping cone or a falling wedge on the daily chart. The falling wedge is a bullish reversal pattern, that is, the price will often break above the upper edge of the pattern and rally. A breakout, if confirmed, could open the doors for a strong corrective move. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,400 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.66 percent drop on the day. The falling wedge resistance is seen at $3,450.  BTC is trapped in a falling wedge – a bullish reversal setup – on the daily chart. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency has created a minor rising channel inside the wedge, as seen in the 4-hour chart. The prospects of BTC confirming a falling wedge breakout above $3,450 would drop if the current 4-hour candle closes below the rising channel support of $3,410. That would open up downside towards $3,314 (200-week moving average). A wedge breakout, if confirmed, would allow a rally toward $3,658 – the high of the bearish gravestone doji candle created on Jan. 26.  On the weekly chart, the 5- and 10-candle MAs are trending south indicating a bearish setup. The falling volume bars, however, signal bearish exhaustion. BTC, therefore, could witness a falling wedge breakout, despite the bearish primary trend. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin’s price fell for a record sixth consecutive month in January, after an early bounce to $4,000 failed to entice mass buying. The leading cryptocurrency by market value closed yesterday at $3,413 on Bitstamp – down 7.59 percent from the monthly opening price of $3,693. Prices dropped 9, 6, 4.4, 37 and 7 percent, respectively, in the previous five months. The second longest run of monthly losses dates back to 2011 when prices dropped 81 percent during the five months from July to November. BTC has fared a little better in the last six months, with a 63 percent loss over the period. That number, however, could rise in the coming months, as the primary trend is still bearish, as discussed yesterday. Further, the price action witnessed over the last four weeks indicates that the sell-on-rise mentality is still intact. The cryptocurrency jumped above $4,000 on Jan. 6, after establishing a bullish higher-low near $3,550 at the end of December. The bullish breakout, however, failed to entice the buyers. In fact, bullish bets tanked on Jan. 10, driving prices back to $3,500 That said, BTC may end the six-month downward trend in February if the 200-week moving average (MA) support, currently at $3,298, fuels a strong move above crucial resistance near $3,650. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,400.  On the monthly chart, the 5- and 10-candle MAs are trending south, indicating a bearish setup. These averages are currently located at $4,154 and $5,599, respectively, and could cap rallies, if any, in the near-term. Validating the bearish averages is the 14-month relative strength index (RSI), which has hit record lows below the low of 44.50 seen in January 2015. The bearish setup would be invalidated only above $4,210 – the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the record low-record high. That level has capped the upside in the last two months.  As seen above, the 200-week moving average (MA) served as strong support seven weeks ago. Another defense of the long-term MA will likely weaken bearish pressures and could yield a break above $3,658 (the high of last Saturday’s gravestone doji candle). A convincing move above that level would invalidate short-term bearish setup and open the doors for a sustained move to $4,000. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin could end its four-year February winning streak unless prices see a strong bounce from key support. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization gained 16, 18, 23.5 and 1.6 percent in the second month of 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). BTC generally posts losses in January before putting on a good show in February. The January losing streak looks certain to extend to the fifth year running with a close tonight in the negative. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,414, representing a 7 percent drop from the monthly opening price of $3,693. However, the odds of bitcoin posting gains in February for the fifth year straight are quite low, as the recent drop to six-week lows has put the bears back in a commanding position. The bearish setup, however, would weaken if the crucial 200-week moving average support, currently at $3,298, holds ground for the second time in two months. That could yield a sustained rally to $4,000.  The above chart shows the 5- and 10-month MAs are trending south and BTC is trading well below these averages for the first time since 2015. Put simply, the primary trend heading into February is bearish, while bullish conditions prevailed in the previous three years. Hence, BTC may have a hard time posting sustainable gains in the next four weeks.  BTC jumped above $4,000 in mid-December, confirming a bullish divergence of the RSI – a strong indicator of a bearish-to-bullish trend change. The follow-through to that trend reversal, however, has been anything but bullish. Moreover, prices fell to six-week lows earlier this week. BTC’s inability to produce significant gains despite the RSI divergence indicates the bearish sentiment is still quite strong.  On the weekly chart, BTC has carved out a bearish-lower high above $4,000, reinforcing the negative view put forward by the downward sloping 10-week MA. The cryptocurrency, therefore, could soon revisit December lows near $3,100. A violation there would establish fresh lower low and open the doors for a deeper drop below $3,000. The probability of BTC posting gains in February would improve if the 200-week MA, currently at $3,298, again serves as strong support. That average had put brakes on the sell-off in December and was followed by a corrective bounce to levels above $4,000. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered slightly from six-week lows seen yesterday and could see a short-term corrective bounce to $3,500. The leading cryptocurrency is currently trading at $3,416 on Bitstamp, having hit a low of $3,322 on Tuesday – a level last seen on Dec. 17. The 2.8 percent recovery could be associated with the oversold readings on the short duration technical indicators seen 24-hours ago. Moreover, Monday’s high-volume range breakdown and the drop to multi-week lows had pushed the relative strength indices on the hourly and 4-hour charts below 30.00 With the minor rally, however, those RSIs have moved back to undersold territory and are now in line with the bearish view put forward by a convincing break below $3,500 seen on Monday. Even so, the drop to December lows near $3,100 may not happen immediately as stronger signs of temporary bearish exhaustion have emerged on the longer duration charts.  As seen above, BTC has reported losses in the last five trading sessions – the longest losing streak since mid-November. Notably, the ascending triangle breakdown on the 4-hour chart confirmed on Monday signaled a resumption of the sell-off from the Jan. 10 high of $4,036. The 5- and 10-day MAs are trending south and the 14-day RSI is reporting bearish conditions with a sub-50 reading. So, the doors look to have been opened for a drop to December lows near $3,100. The cryptocurrency, however, may test bears’ resolve by rising to the bearish 10-day MA of $3,511, as the long-tails attached to the previous three daily candles signal a lack of conviction on the part of the bears. A long-tailed candle occurs when there is a big gap between the daily low and UTC close, that is, when sellers fail to secure a close near the lowest point of the day.  The bullish divergence of the RSI and the falling channel breakout indicate the sell-off from the high of $3,658 has likely paused. BTC, therefore, could rise to $3,500 and above. The outlook, however, will remain bearish as long as BTC is held below $3,658 (the high of Saturday’s bearish reversal candle). Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin (BTC) is on the defensive after a drop to six-week lows and could soon test crucial long-term support below $3,300. The cryptocurrency fell to $3,322 – the lowest level since Dec. 17 earlier today – bolstering the bearish view put forward by Monday’s high-volume range breakdown. Trading volumes jumped to 18-day highs near $7 billion yesterday, according to CoinMarketCap data. The high-volume sell-off has likely opened the doors to re-test of December lows near $3,100. Moreover, the long-term support level put the brakes on a sell-off back in December, and was followed by a corrective bounce to levels above $4,000. A strong bounce from the 200-week SMA line would likely embolden the bulls, but the probability of a bull reversal from that SMA support looks low, according to technical indicators. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,380 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.5 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  As seen above, BTC is again trading within striking distance of the 200-week SMA of $3,298. The support had held ground on a weekly closing basis (Sunday, UTC) in mid-December, possibly because the relative strength index (RSI) was reporting oversold conditions at the time. This time, however, the SMA support could be breached, as the RSI is currently in undersold territory.  The RSI on the daily chart is also biased toward the bears, as opposed to the record oversold conditions seen in November and December. The 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are also trending south, indicating a bearish setup. Hence, a drop to the December low of $3,122 could be on the cards.  The RSIs on the 4-hour and hourly charts are reporting oversold conditions below 30.00. Therefore, a convincing break below the 200-week SMA of $3,298 could be preceded by a minor bounce. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin ended a two-week period of consolidation with a drop to six-week lows earlier today. The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell below $3,470 at 04:45 UTC, confirming a downside break of a triangle pattern. That range breakdown was followed by a quick slide to $3,357 – the lowest level since Dec. 17 – according to Bitstamp data. A prolonged period of consolidation usually yields a big move in the direction of the breakout. For instance, BTC ended a multi-week-long trading range with a move below $6,000 on Nov. 14 and what followed was a violent sell-off to levels below $4,000. However, the duration of the recent consolidation was shorter than the one seen before the big bearish move of Nov. 14. So, the magnitude of any post-breakdown move would likely be smaller too. Nevertheless, the latest range breakdown could at least yield re-test of December lows near $3,100, as the primary trend represented by the downward sloping 10-week moving average (MA) is negative. The bearish case looks even stronger if we take into account the bull failure seen over the weekend. Prices had turned in favor of the bulls with a move to $3,658 on Saturday. That triangle breakout, however, petered out, with prices falling back to $3,500 yesterday. A failed breakout is widely considered a strong bearish signal. Possibly adding extra downward pressure on prices, safe-haven asset gold – which has been inversely correlated with BTC since November – found acceptance above $1,300 on Friday. At the time of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,430, representing a 3 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  On the daily chart, BTC charted a bearish gravestone doji on Saturday, meaning the day began with a positive move but ended flat on the day. Adding to the bulls’ woes is the negative follow-through as represented by the drop to six-week lows today. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is also reporting a range breakdown below 40.00. So, the path of least resistance looks to be to on the downside, and the bulls will likely feel emboldened only above $3,658 (the high of the gravestone doji).  As seen in the above chart, BTC’s triangle breakout on Saturday was short-lived and the cryptocurrency has now found acceptance under the lower edge of the triangle. The chart also shows a Bollinger Band breakdown, with a convincing break below the lower band. The RSI, however, is reporting oversold conditions. As a result, BTC may revisit $3,500 before resuming the drop toward the December lows.  The 10-week MA is still trending south, indicating a bearish setup. There are, however, signs of indecision in the marketplace, as represented by last week’s classic doji candle. Further, a sustained drop in trading volumes likely indicates bearish exhaustion. The outlook, therefore, would turn bullish if BTC ends this week above the doji candle high of $3,658. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

" Edward Woodford is the co-founder and CEO of Seed CX, which, offers a licensed exchange for institutional trading and settlement of spot digital asset products and plans to offer a market for CFTC-regulated digital asset derivatives. ——— While 2018’s falling bitcoin prices led many observers to write off digital assets altogether, the correction should actually help force the market as a whole to mature. That maturation is exactly what the space needs to attract more institutional investors, whose arrival en masse will improve the market for everyone by increasing liquidity, both directly, via the funds they invest, and indirectly, via the fact of their adoption. Their entry will signal to other traders that the market is stable and trustworthy. Between 2015 and late 2017, when the price of bitcoin was steadily rising, there was bullish euphoria in the market. Traders were willing to rely on little-known or unregulated exchanges despite the risks – the potential upside made those risks worthwhile. In the early days, digital assets presented a unique scenario by conventional trading standards: the operational risk (risk of loss from inadequate procedures, security, and policies used to conduct operations) of trading was greater than the market risk (risk of financial loss due to the prevailing conditions of a market an investor is invested in). Loss of some money (or digital assets) here and there to hacking, for example, could be outweighed by the fact that returns were astronomical and investors were indifferent to the price of bitcoin and other digital assets as it was increasing, exponentially, in a very short period of time. For example, bitcoin experienced a price increase of 460+ percent over the six-month period from July 1, 2017 ($2,492.60) to January 1, 2018 ($14,112.20). Trading on platforms with very high operational risks could be entirely logical using an “adjusted” Sharpe Ratio, a risk-weighted measure. The adjusted Sharpe Ratio would take into account the return of investing in bitcoin over a period of time and the risk-free rate of investing in a risk-free asset (such as a U.S. Ttreasury bond) and determine the risk of the portfolio (market and operational risks) to determine the risk-adjusted return. Using the example above, taking a risk-free rate of approximately 1.5 percent, the portfolio’s return, which exceeds 460 percent, and the portfolio’s risk of, let’s say, 135 percent (35 percent for market risk and 100 percent for operational risk), would yield a Sharpe Ratio of approximately three. This Sharpe Ratio would represent an attractive risk-weighted return as the return exceeds the risk by a multiple of three. Today, returns have normalized for arbitrage opportunities as liquidity has increased across exchanges. Those who employed a purely long strategy and enjoyed exponential returns would now be experiencing losses if employing the same strategy over the last six months. Aside from a purely directional strategy, traders will tell you that “easy returns,” such as simple arbitrage opportunities (buying the same asset on one exchange and selling it at a much higher price on another) have disappeared. When the returns they’re seeing are closer to what they’d expect from more established asset classes, traders’ willingness to accept the op-risk, or potential of losses from hacking and other preventable causes, is greatly diminished. In short, the change to the risk-reward ratio means that exchanges are no longer given a pass for poor operations, lax security, troubling conflicts of interest, and insufficient oversight. For example, most exchanges use a single wallet to hold assets for all participants. Even with the bulk of assets held in cold storage, a single wallet creates a tempting target for hackers and other criminals. Now, we’re seeing more exchanges introduce segmented wallet infrastructure (as at Seed CX, where we create a dedicated wallet for each exchange participant). This attitude shift means exchanges that offer dedicated wallets and other security-focused features – those that have the lowest operational risk – will attract more institutional investors, who must consider not only financial and operational risks but also risks to their reputation when trading digital assets. It also means exchanges have to offer the surveillance and account infrastructures required to prevent inefficient or suspect trading: trade alerts, circuit breakers, order book audit trails, and so on. As we mentioned above, changes in the market since 2017’s rally mean that “long-only” strategies are no longer workable and “easy return” opportunities are much harder to come by because more groups are chasing the same opportunities. For example, DeVere Capital recently announced the launch of an actively managed cryptocurrency fund that will be focused on arbitrage opportunities between exchanges. This means exchanges that want to attract and keep traders must build the infrastructure to offer more sophisticated trading strategies, including swaps, derivatives, and options, not to mention combinations of those and spot markets. The transformation of the market infrastructure still has an overhang of its history. In the first three quarters of 2018, hackers stole $927 million of cryptocurrency from exchanges and other trading platforms. And while many exchanges still fall short on security measures, others are making significant strides forward. In addition to segmented wallets, we’re seeing greater use of multi-signature security (at Seed CX we require two keys, generated by independent parties, to access wallets), more enforcement of whitelisted withdrawal IP addresses, and the increased pursuit of regulatory licenses. Two years ago, the entrance of institutional investors to the digital asset space seemed distant and unlikely. Today, thanks to falling prices, institutional investors are not only entering the market but are increasingly dictating the terms of the marketplace – to the benefit of everyone trading in it.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is largely unchanged on the day and maybe building for a strong exit from the weeks-long period of consolidation. The leading cryptocurrency hit highs above $4,100 on Jan. 8 before moving lower to around $3,500, where it’s become trapped in a tightening trading range. The bears have persistently failed to keep prices below $3,500, weakening the bearish case put forward by the 9 percent drop seen on Jan. 10. That strong support level has seen the formation of a descending triangle pattern over the last 2.5 weeks, with an upper edge at $3,600 and the base located near $3,500. Bitcoin is currently trading at $3,550 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.4 percent change on a 24-hour basis. The probability of a bullish breakout appears high, as the sluggish price action suggests the sellers have run out of steam. Further, prices barely moved following the withdrawal of Cboe’s exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal on Wednesday. It worth noting that, on Thursday, the trading range (spread between the price high and low) stood near the three-month low of $45.17 registered on Jan. 12. That was the fourth sub-$50 trading range of this month, according to CoinMarketCap.. On the previous three occasions, the trading range widened sharply on the following day, so if history repeats, we may see some movement in the next 12-24 hours.  A convincing break above $3,600 on the 4-hour chart would confirm a triangle breakout and open the doors to $3,774 (Jan. 19 high). A violation there would expose the psychological hurdle of $4,000. The descending triangle is widely considered a bearish continuation setup and it often ends up accelerating the preceding move. As a result, a downside break, if confirmed, could prove costly.

" With bitcoin (BTC) showing resilience to negative news flow, a strong bullish move is looking increasingly likely. On Wednesday, the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s (CBOE) BZX equity exchange withdrew its request for a rule change by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that would have allowed it to list a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) backed by VanEck and SolidX. The market narrative with respect to the ETF is that its approval could trigger the next bull run in the leading cryptocurrency by market value. Moreover, in the past, markets have responded negatively to delays or rejections in ETF approval. The latest ETF withdrawal, however, has barely moved the needle for BTC’s price. The cryptocurrency continues to trade in a sideways manner above the crucial support at $3,500. The calm response to the bearish news could be considered a sign of seller exhaustion – more so, as the primary trend is still bearish. As a result, the cryptocurrency could soon end the 14-day-long consolidation with a bullish breakout. Further, the Cboe ETF – first filed with the SEC in June 2018 – had experienced several delays in the past. As a result, the bar of expectation was set low and was likely priced in by traders. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,540 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.70 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  On the daily chart, BTC has created a descending triangle, which comprises a horizontal line connecting a strong support level and a falling trendline representing lower highs. A UTC close above the upper edge of the triangle, currently at $3,630, would confirm the breakout and could yield a rally to the psychological resistance of $4,000. The odds of the bull breakout look good, as the ETF news failed to embolden the bears and gold is feeling the pull of gravity (as discussed yesterday, BTC and gold look to be inversely related).

" Bitcoin (BTC) traders could get cues from an apparent negative correlation that has developed between bitcoin and gold prices. Gold picked up a strong bid at $1,196 on Nov. 13 and jumped to $1,300 on Jan. 4, possibly due to a sell-off in the weakening U.S. dollar. The greenback was down against most currencies in last two months of 2018 on growing speculation that the Federal Reserve (Fed) could decrease or pause interest rate hikes in 2019. Bitcoin, however, did not benefit from that broad-based sell-off in the dollar. The cryptocurrency instead saw a revived bear market with a convincing move below $6,000 on Nov. 14 – a day after gold found takers around $1,200 per ounce. That price action indicates that the two assets are inversely correlated. Validating that argument is the 90-day correlation coefficient of -0.593. The statistical measure ranges from -1 to 1, with a negative number representing the inverse relationship between the two variables, while a positive number implies direct correlation. As a result, the leading cryptocurrency by market value could be influenced by the next move in gold prices. Currently, the safe haven metal is trading at $1,285, having hit a three-week low of $1,276 earlier this week. Meanwhile, BTC is trading in a narrow range above $3,500 for the 13th straight day. The prolonged period of consolidation could end with a strong bullish move if the corrective pullback in gold worsens. It is worth noting that correlation is not causation and only describes the relative change in one variable when there is a change in another. As seen above, bitcoin and gold have moved in opposite directions since late November. Gold rallied 8.33 percent in seven weeks leading up to Jan. 4. During the same time, BTC depreciated by 50 percent. Further, gold’s repeated failure at $1,300 has established that psychological level as a stiff near-term resistance. Meanwhile, BTC has defended $3,500 since Jan. 11. The cryptocurrency could see a strong bullish move if the pullback in the yellow metal gathers steam.  On the daily chart, BTC created a “long-tailed” candle at the crucial support of $3,500, signaling bearish exhaustion. A positive follow-through – that is, a convincing move above $3,615 (Tuesday’s low) – would confirm bullish bias. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin (BTC) is witnessing the longest stretch of range-bound price activity in three months. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been largely restricted to trading between $3,700 and $3,500 since Jan. 11 – the longest stretch at such a narrow range since the end of October. Back then, the market had gone quiet, with prices staying within the $6,500–$6,350 range in the 12 days leading up to Oct. 28. On the following day, BTC dropped to $6,208. After another period of sideways movement, bitcoin fell well below the crucial support level of $6,000 on Nov. 14. The current period of consolidation may also end with a big move to the downside, as BTC reinforced the primary bearish trend – as represented by the downward sloping 10-week moving average – with a 10 percent slide on Jan. 10. The potential post-breakdown drop toward December lows near $3,100 could be rapid, too, as a prolonged period of consolidation often ends with a violent move. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $3,515 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.40 percent drop on a 24-hour basis. As seen above, BTC’s 12-day-long range play is the longest since Oct. 28. Back then, Bollinger bands (standard deviation of +2,-2 on the 20-day moving average) were flat-lined, representing a neutral bias. As of now, Bollinger bands are signaling a bearish bias with a slight tilt to the downside. Another major difference is that prices had consolidated around the 20-day MA in October. This time, however, the moving average is working as stiff resistance, as indicated by BTC’s failure to secure a UTC close above that level on Jan. 19.  The outlook remains bearish while BTC is held below the downward sloping 10-week moving average (MA), currently at $3,715. The long upper shadow (spread between high and close) attached to the previous weekly candle indicates that the “sell-on-rise” mentality is still intact, meaning the brief price bounce soon ran into offers. That candle also confirmed the end of a corrective bounce from December lows signaled by the preceding bearish engulfing candle.

" Evidence is emerging that bitcoin has yet to truly earn its reputation as an “uncorrelated asset.” Case in point, bitcoin’s latest sell-off from $6,000 to nearly $3,000 was accompanied by a surge in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). The VIX measures the 30-day forward-looking volatility of the S&P 500 to gauge the market’s fear and risk tolerance, which is why it is commonly referred to as the “fear gauge” for the broader U.S. stock market.  In theory, the VIX should be low when the S&P 500 is in a steady uptrend and should only rise as does fear, causing panic selling and for either smart or weak hands to be shaken out of the market. Bitcoin, being a store of value that isn’t the product of a government, is advertised to be unaffected by the perceived fear or risk in any market, yet as the chart below shows, that is not yet the case.  The VIX printed two significant peaks in 2018. The first occurred on Feb. 6 when it reached 50.3 and the second on Dec. 24 when it reached 36.1. At the first peak, the S&P 500 was down nearly 10 percent from its January highs and on the second peak it was down closer to 20 percent from the record highs achieved just two months prior.  Needless to say, fear was, and still is, prevalent in the broader U.S. Stock market, which should have resulted in either a stable or bullish bitcoin, right? Wrong. Bitcoin inversely correlated with the VIX on both occasions. When the VIX reached its first peak, bitcoin had just finished falling 70 percent from its January highs and during the second peak, its price had just declined another 50 percent.  Bitcoin’s negative correlation with the VIX shows it performs poorly when fear in the U.S. equities market creates a “risk-off” environment – by definition, the opposite of a safe haven asset. For reference, the globally recognized safe haven asset, gold, positively correlated with the VIX during its two major peaks in 2018. During the VIX’s February high, gold (US$/OZ) largely traded sideways between $1,300-$1,370 and only began to fall toward $1,160 in May as the VIX sank and the S&P 500 regained strength.  Gold, again, correlated with the VIX during its December peak. As equities began crashing and fears of a global economic recession circulated, the shiny metal had already been in a 20 week long and more than 10 percent uptrend.   Indeed, the physical physical store of value is still earning its name as a safe haven asset while the digital alternative has yet to be able to.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) weekly gains were wiped out at the weekend at a key moving average that previously offered support. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization jumped to highs above $6,750 on Saturday, having weakened the immediate bearish case with a repeated defense of the psychological support level of $3,500 last week. BTC, however, failed to secure a UTC close above the 21-day MA. More importantly, rejection at that MA hurdle proved costly – BTC fell 3.8 percent to $3,470 yesterday. So, it could be argued that the MA line, which served as strong support in the two weeks leading up to Jan. 10, has now taken on the role of stiff resistance. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,527 on Bitstamp, representing a 4.30 percent drop on a 24-hour basis. Meanwhile, the 21-day MA is seen at $3,732. The strong pullback from the 21-day MA indicates that the “sell on rise” mentality is still quite strong. After all, the primary trend is still bearish, as represented by the downward sloping 10-week moving average (MA). The probability of a sustained break below $3,500 remains high while BTC is held below the newfound resistance of the 21-day MA.  As seen above, BTC failed at the 21-day MA on Saturday and fell back to $3,500, reinforcing the bearish view put forward by the downward sloping 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) and the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) of 42.00. As a result, the probability of a drop below $3,500 has increased. That would only bolster the bearish technical setup and open the doors to December lows near $3,100. However, the bearish case would weaken if BTC secures a UTC close above the 21-month MA of $3,732.  The long upper shadow (spread between high and close) attached to last week’s candle represents the “sell on rise” trader mentality – after a quick rise, a selloff erased the gains. The primary trend remains bearish as long as BTC is trading below the downward sloping 10-week MA. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin’s eight-day stretch of consolidation looks to have weakened the prospects of a drop back to December lows near $3,100. The leading cryptocurrency by market value has been restricted to a narrow range of $3,500 to $3,700 since Jan. 11. That range play is somewhat surprising, as BTC had set the stage for a quick slide toward December lows near $3,100 with a 9 percent drop on Jan. 10 – the biggest single-day decline since Nov. 24. Notably, prices fell to $3,500 that day, erasing the hard-fought gains of the preceding two weeks. Despite the sharp bearish reversal, a convincing break below the psychological support of $3,500 has remained elusive for eight days. That could be considered a sign of sellers unwilling to offer the cryptocurrency so low in the bear market. Put simply, the probability of a drop to December lows has diminished, courtesy of the range bound activity. As a result, range breakout and a re-test of $4,000 could be in the offing. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $3,620 on Bitstamp. 
As seen above, BTC fell sharply on Jan. 10, confirming a bearish doji reversal. The relative strength index (RSI) also fell back into bearish territory below 50.00. Still, the psychological support at $3,500 has held ground.  The descending triangle breakout on the hourly chart could be considered evidence of bear failure at $3,500 resulting in positive price action. More importantly, the triangle breakout has opened the doors to $3,724 – the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. A move above $3,724 would confirm a bearish-to-bullish trend change on the hourly chart and allow a stronger rally to $4,000 (target as per the measured move method).

" Bitcoin price volatility has crashed in the last 12 months as the bear market killed off the speculative frenzy. Daily volatility, the spread between the price high and price low, stood at $61 yesterday – down a hefty 98 percent from the figure of $3,468 observed on Jan. 16, 2018 – according to CoinMarketCap data. Meanwhile, bitcoin’s price is also down 74 percent year-on-year. Generally, with a sharp drop in price, volatility in dollar terms tends to fall in parallel. Notably, volatility was extremely high in percentage terms 12 months ago. The trading range was 26 percent on Jan. 16, 2018, indicating that the crypto market frenzy was at its peak. Volatility, however, subsided as the year progressed: dropping from $973 in the first quarter to $345, $245 and $195, in the following quarters, respectively. Meanwhile, in percentage terms, average daily volatility fell from 9.14 percent to 3.6 percent over 2018. This year has begun on a much more calm note. Daily volatility has remained largely below $200 and hit a 2.5-month low of $45.17 on Jan. 12. Many consider the slide in volatility a sign of speculative froth leaving the market and the cryptocurrency nearing a bottom. It is worth noting that an extended period of low volatility usually ends up paving way for a big move. Therefore, BTC could soon violate the six-day-long trading range of $3,500 to $3,700. Moreover, a range breakdown looks likely as the long-term technical charts are biased toward the bears. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,585 on Bitstamp.  As seen above, BTC fell 13 percent last week, reinforcing the bearish view put forward by the descending 10-week moving average, currently at $3,919. The outlook remains bearish as long as BTC is held below the 10-week MA.  BTC has created a neutral diamond pattern on the 4-hour chart. The prospects of BTC breaking the $3,700-$3,500 range to the downside would rise significantly if the diamond is breached on the lower side. The relative strength index (RSI) is biased bearish at 41. So, there is plenty scope for a sell-off post-breakdown. Put simply, the prospects of BTC breaching the $3,700-$3,500 range to the downside would rise significantly if the diamond breakdown is confirmed.

" Bitcoin (BTC) has reported losses in January for the last four years, and a fifth now looks on the cards. The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell 32 percent, 14.6 percent, 0.10 percent and 26.64 percent in the first month of 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Notably, the odds are stacked in favor of BTC extending the four-year January losing streak this year. BTC fell 13 percent last week, signaling an end of the corrective bounce from the December low of $3,122. The sell-off reinforced the bearish view put forward by the downward sloping 10-week simple moving average. As a result, a drop to $3,122 in the next couple of weeks cannot be ruled out. That said, the probability of BTC beating the trend this month would rise if the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-day moving average (MA), currently at $3,768, is convincingly scaled in the next few days.  A breach there would strengthen the short-term bullish case.  As seen above, BTC’s 32 percent drop in January 2015 marked an end of the four-year January winning streak. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,611 – down 2 percent from the monthly opening price of $3,689.  As seen above, BTC failed to cut through the 21-candle MA earlier this month, strengthening the bearish view put forward by the downward sloping line. Further, the drop to $3,476 (Jan. 13 low) invalidated the bullish trend change signaled by an outside reversal candle on Dec 20. As a result, the path of least resistance looks to be to the downside.  The 21-candle MA on the daily chart acted as strong support on multiple occasions before it was breached on Jan. 10. The bearish pressure would weaken somewhat if prices cross back above the 21-candle MA, currently at $3,768, in the next day or two. That would boost the prospects of BTC closing above the monthly opening price of $3,689 on Jan. 31. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Signs are emerging that the futures market may not be impressed by bitcoin’s recovery from 15-months lows in December – at press time, the cryptocurrency’s spot price is higher than the futures price.  As of writing, the global average or spot price calculated by CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) is currently $3,650 – up 16.9 percent from the low of $3,122 reached on December.  Meanwhile, futures contracts are trading below the spot price. As seen above (CME chart), January futures are reporting a $20 discount (futures price-spot price). Further, contracts expiring in February, March and June are trading at a discount of $30, $40 and $80, respectively.  A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell a something at a future specified price and date, allowing for investors to hedge or speculate on the performance of the underlying asset. Hence, BTC futures trading at a discount to spot price (also known as market inversion) is a clear indication that the participants are still bearish.  Put simply, bitcoin’s price in one month, two months and six months from now is expected to be lower than its current price. So, it could be argued that the bear market is alive and kicking.  The outlook would turn bullish if the futures start trading at a premium to spot price. Moreover, that is a classic trait of the bull market.  That said, an unprecedented rise in premium serves as a warning sign of market nearing a long-term top. For instance, BTC futures were carrying a staggering $2,000 premium over spot price in December 2017. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" That bitcoin (BTC) may be closing on a long-term bottom is generally accepted by now. After all, the leading cryptocurrency by market value has dropped by close to 70 percent over the last 13 months. The challenge now is to pick up early signs of a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change, which may be possible with the help of the 10-week simple moving average (SMA). Acting as resistance, that moving average proved a tough nut to crack in the eight weeks to Nov. 14 – the day BTC reentered the bear market with a big drop below $6,000. Further, BTC has charted bearish-lower highs above the 10-week SMA in the last 13 months. Hence, acceptance above that hurdle could be considered a sign that the process of bearish-to-bullish trend change has begun. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,630 on Bitstamp, representing a 2.5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. Meanwhile, the 10-week SMA is located at $3,919. It is worth noting that a full confirmation of a longer-term bullish reversal would be a convincing break above the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $5,400.  As seen above, BTC repeatedly failed to cross the 10-week SMA on a weekly closing basis (Sunday’s, as per UTC) before falling below $6,000 on Nov. 14. Prior to that, BTC did cross the 10-week SMA in the last week of both February and April, the third week of July and in the last week of August. These bullish breakouts, however, were short-lived: BTC fell back below the 10-week SMA in the following two weeks, trapping the bulls on the wrong side of the market (marked by arrows). Put simply, the cryptocurrency has struggled to breach the 10-week SMA throughout the ongoing bear market. As a result, only a sustained break above the 10-week SMA (at least four weekly candles above the average) would imply bullish reversal. The outlook remains bearish as long as prices are trading below the downward sloping 10-week SMA of $3,919.  BTC closed back above $3,566 (Dec. 27 low) yesterday, establishing a sideways channel on the daily chart. With the weekly chart still biased toward the bears, the lower end of the channel, currently at $3,465, could be breached soon. A channel breakdown, if confirmed, would boost the prospects of a drop to the December low of $3,122.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" After breaching key support on Sunday, emboldened bears could soon push bitcoin (BTC) prices back towards $3,100. Following a drop to a 3.5-week low of $3,476 at 16:00 UTC yesterday, the cryptocurrency closed at $3,516, effectively invalidating the bullish view put forward by the higher low of $3,566 carved out on Dec. 27. That move also added credence to the bearish reversal signaled by the 9 percent price drop witnessed last Thursday. Put simply, the bears have strengthened their control of the market, after the bulls failed to penetrate the head-and-shoulders neckline resistance of $4,130 and build a stronger rally last week. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,530 on Bitstamp, representing a 2 percent drop on a 24-hour basis. As seen above, BTC found acceptance below $3,566 (Dec. 27 low) yesterday, validating the bearish doji reversal confirmed on Jan. 10. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is reporting bearish conditions at 42.00, having breached the ascending trendline last week. Further, the 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are trending south, indicating bearish setup. So, it could be argued that the recovery rally from the December low of $3,122 has only ended up recharging the engines for a fresh sell-off.  BTC’s fall back to $3,500 has invalidated the positive view put forward by the three-day bullish outside-reversal candle of Dec. 20. Moreover, the cryptocurrency’s failure to produce a significant price rally despite the positive divergence of the RSI, confirmed on Dec. 14, indicates that the bearish sentiment is still quite strong.  On the weekly chart, BTC has created a bearish outside-reversal candle (last week’s price action engulfed the previous week’s high and low) signaling a resumption of the primary bearish trend, as represented by the downward sloping 10-week  moving average (MA).  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) price saw its biggest drop for seven weeks on Thursday, weakening the prospects of a bullish breakout above $4,100. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value hit a 3.5-week low of $3,503 yesterday, before closing (as per UTC) at $3,627 – down 9.4 percent on the day. That was the biggest single-day drop since Nov. 24 and the fourth biggest daily loss of the last two months, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Essentially, the hard-fought gains of the last two weeks have been erased in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency had carved out a bullish-higher low near $3,550 on Dec. 27 before crossing $4,000 on Jan. 6. The follow-through to break above $4,000, however, was anything but encouraging. Moreover, signs of bullish exhaustion emerged near the crucial resistance of $4,130 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline) and demoralized bulls started to exit the market yesterday, leading to a sharp drop in prices. As a result, the bears may be feeling emboldened and could attack the crucial support lined up near $3,550. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,630. Bitcoin fell to $3,500 yesterday, confirming a bearish doji reversal on the daily chart. The cryptocurrency also closed below the crucial 50-day moving average (MA) support, Adding credence to the bearish move, trading volumes jumped to the highest level since Dec. 21 and 14-day relative strength index (RSI) breached the ascending trendline to the downside. With the odds stacked in favor of the bears, the immediate support of $3,566 (Dec. 27 low) could be breached soon. That would only bolster the already bearish technical setup.  On the weekly chart, BTC has created a bearish outside reversal candle – this week’s price action has engulfed the previous week’s high and low – having failed to penetrate the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) hurdle for four weeks straight. The candlestick pattern indicates that the week began with optimism, but is approaching a more pessimistic close. As a result, it is widely considered a sign of bearish reversal. Put simply, the doors have been opened for a re-test of the 200-week MA lined up at $3,250. Supporting that bearish case is the downward sloping 10-week MA.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" The price of bitcoin fell more than 10 percent during Thursday’s trading session as the cryptocurrency erased a large portion of its recent gains.  At 6:00 UTC, bitcoin opened the trading hour at a price of $4,018, but fell to $3,748 before the hour was complete. After trading sideways until 16:00 UTC, the sell-off accelerated to a low of $3,570, according to CoinDesk pricing data.  Bitcoin’s current price of $3,610 reflects a $367 difference and more than 9 percent drop from its 24-hour opening price of $3,995, CoinDesk data further reveals.   In the last 24-hours, a total of $6.4 billion of bitcoin was traded across exchanges as its total market capitalization fell roughly 7 percent from $70 billion to $64 billion.  The broader market has accompanied bitcoin in its latest dip as it usually does when bitcoin markets show weakness.  According to Coindesk’s Crypto-Economic Explorer (CEX), 18 of the 19 tracked cryptocurrencies are reporting double-digit 24-hour losses, with several extending depreciation beyond 15 percent including litecoin (LTC), neo (NEO) and cardano (ADA).  Cardano is the worst performers today, currently printing an 18 percent loss. As it stands, the total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market is registering $122 billion, down 10.2 percent on the day according to CoinMarketCap.

" Bitcoin is losing altitude as an unwinding of bullish bets is creating downward pressure on prices. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,780 on Bitstamp – down 5 percent on a 24-hour basis – having found offers above $4,000 at 06:00 UTC. Notably, the price drop is accompanied by a decline in the bullish bets. For instance, the BTC/USD long positions on the Bitfinex exchange fell to an eight-day low of 31,237 earlier today and are currently down 8 percent at 31,255 – the biggest single-day drop since Dec. 19. Further, the long-short ratio has pulled back to 1.35 from the five-month high of 1.5 reached yesterday, indicating waning bullish sentiment. What’s more interesting is that the “long squeeze” comes after repeated failure on the part of the bulls to clear the key resistance above $4,100. So, it seems safe to say that the demoralized bulls are exiting the market and that could attract sellers.  As seen above, long positions have dropped sharply, while short positions are largely unchanged on the day. That said, today’s sell-off could entice the bears, leading to a rise in shorts and a deeper drop in prices.  The bearish doji reversal – back-to-back doji candles and a negative follow-through – seen in the above chart indicates that the recovery rally from the December low of $3,122 has stalled and the bears have regained some control. Validating that argument is the breakdown of the trendline connecting the Dec. 28 low and Jan. 6 low. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is also rolling over in favor of the bears. Moreover, the failure on the part of the bulls to force an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout could be considered a strong bearish signal, especially since the bull flag breakout, witnessed in the 4-hour chart earlier this week, had set the stage for a break above $4,300. As a result, BTC risks falling to the major support lined up at $3,566 (Dec. 27 low).  With prices trading well below $3,934 (flag low), the bullish view put forward by the bull flag breakout on the 4-hour chart earlier this week is no longer valid.

" The ratio of long-to-short positions placed on bitcoin (BTC) has reached its highest level in over five months on cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. At press time, the BTC long positions placed on the exchange total 33,750 units, worth $137.3 million at current market prices, whereas the number of short positions is roughly 11,000 units less at just 22,787 – now worth just under $93 million. This creates the long-to-short ratio of nearly 1.5:1 – its highest since August 6th of last year. Bitcoin longs and shorts (Bitfinex)  The drop in short positions is not exactly surprising, considering the price of bitcoin fell roughly 50 percent between Nov. 14 and Dec. 14, giving traders ample time to lock in profits while awaiting further opportunities. A bullish technical reversal pattern known as the “inverse head and shoulders” pattern is also evident on the bitcoin’s price chart, which may be playing another factor in scaring bears out of the market for now. Although the long/short ratio being at multi-month highs may seem encouraging for bitcoin bulls, the market will likely witness another sharp decline if key support near $3,200 is breached, as it would signal the latest corrective bounce to nearly $4,400 has ended. This would put the market at risk of experiencing a “long squeeze” or rapid closure of long positions, which could have a rapid and bearish effect on the price of bitcoin since the only way to terminate a long position is to sell back the longed BTC.

" With the bitcoin (BTC) market showing signs of indecision, prices could soon retreat back below $4,000. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization witnessed two-way business yesterday before ending largely unchanged on the day (as per UTC) at $3,995 on Bitstamp. Worryingly for the bulls, BTC created a doji candle on Tuesday – widely considered a sign of indecision in the market – even though a bull flag breakout, witnessed yesterday, had seemingly set the stage for a move above $4,300. Notably, the candlestick pattern appeared at the top of the recent recovery rally and near crucial resistance above $4,100, representing bullish exhaustion. The bears, therefore, have an opportunity to make a slight comeback, especially if buyers fail to keep prices above the previous day’s low of $3,934. As of writing, bitcoin is changing hands at $4,010 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.80 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  As seen above, BTC has carved out a doji candle at the confluence of the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) and the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance. The prospects of a bull breakout above $4,130 (neckline + 50-day EMA) would drop sharply if BTC confirms a bearish doji reversal with a UTC close below $3,934. That will likely put the focus back on the long-term bearish technical setup and allow a drop to $3,566 (Dec. 27 low). It is worth noting that a drop towards $3,566 would imply inverse head-and-shoulders failure, which is widely considered a strong bearish signal. Put simply, the bulls need progress soon. A UTC close above $4,130 would confirm an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout and open the doors for a stronger rally.  BTC witnessed a bull flag breakout on the 4-hour chart yesterday, signaling a resumption of the rally from the Jan. 6 low of $3,753. So far, however, a break above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance of $4,130 has remained elusive. That said, the bull flag pattern is still valid and would lose credibility only below the previous day’s low of $3,934. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Christopher Brookins is the founder of Pugilist Ventures, a quantitative crypto fund founded out of Carnegie Mellon. ———————————————————————————————— Since the end of 2018, price action has been demonstrably negative, which surprised many expecting the end of Q4 historical “pump” in prices. The price plummet appears largely driven by negative sentiment and swathes of selling pressure after the 2018 support level of $6,000 finally broke (dashed black line). This selling pressure kept prices well into the oversold range (using RSI and SWTO) for several weeks. Only recently, has price begun to rebound. Even so, RSI and SWTO are still trending downward (black arrows), which may point to further price weakness at the beginning of Q1 2019 while bitcoin searches for a sustainable bottom.  Charts via Tradingview.com As mentioned prior, many market commentators and participants assumed, incorrectly, that Q4 was always a strong period for market price growth, specifically from mid-November to the end of December. However, what many viewed as historically consistent price growth during this period, was in fact historically consistent volatility growth. The graphic below shows historical daily volatility trends of bitcoin on a yearly basis since 2013. Thus, the supposition that many bulls were wrongly betting on was that higher volatility always equates to higher prices.  *Gdax/Coinbase Pro As the volatility chart illustrates, the volatility trends of BTC, since 2013, do follow predictable patterns, culminating in higher volatility during Q4. This dynamic unfolded again in 2018 as price volatility compressed from October to mid-November (black lines), which typically precedes a breakout in price action. However, this time, volatility broke out to the downside for bitcoin. After analyzing the overall trend in 2018 (demonstrably bearish), price volatility compression, historical volatility patterns, and fundamental indicators, it should have been more clear to market participants that the probability of a negative price breakout was far higher than to the upside. Fundamental indicators can be quite useful for ascertaining a “narrative” of price movements and patterns, as long as the narrative is rooted in non-subjective data exploration. However, given the small sample size of bitcoin market cycles (n=10), each indicators output and predictive ability should be taken with a “grain of salt”. Nic Carter from Castle Island Ventures / CoinMetrics and Antoine Le Calvez from Blockchain.info recently pioneered a new concept called realized cap (capitalization). The differentiation between realized cap and market cap being “instead of counting all of the mined coins at equal, current price, the UTXOs are aggregated and assigned a price based on the BTC/USD market price at the time when said UTXOs last moved.” David Puell and Murad Mahmudov do an excellent job explaining these terms and significance further in their article. Using data from CoinMetrics, the significance of realized cap compared to market cap can be visualized quite dramatically, albeit via a small sample size. The crossover points between market cap and realized cap can be viewed almost similar to golden crosses, whereby market cap breaching above realized cap is a re-ignition of a bull cycle, while a cross beneath may indicate the final stretch of a bear cycle. Beyond the aforementioned, this comparison offers lessons which may bear out or “repeat” in 2019. Looking at the graphic, market cap went beneath realized cap on December 28, 2014, and stayed beneath realized cap until October 28, 2015, which coincides with the data-validated, high volatility period for bitcoin. In this case, volatility coincided with price growth for bitcoin and kicked off the start of an amazing two-year bull run for bitcoin. This time around, market cap fell beneath realized cap on November 20, 2018. So, if history repeats itself (which is a tepid assertion), an investor might expect further price declines in 2019 followed by sideways trading, until a reignition of a new bull cycle at the end of Q4 2019 (November to December 2019).  Correlation to Δprice of 0.19 Additionally, using realized cap, an additional ratio or oscillator can be created that further explains bitcoin’s market cycles, market cap to realized cap (MVRM). The MVRM provides a useful indicator that visualizes the above dynamic via one ratio. For example, historically, a value beneath 1.0 is undervalued while a value above 3.0 is overvalued; and above 4.0 is a negative inflection for prices. Currently, MVRM is 0.82 and the all-time low is 0.56. So, despite bitcoin being in undervalued territory, MVRM still possibly has further room to fall, which is consistent with the end of Q4 2019 narrative. Further support of the significance of MVRM for price movements can be seen by the correlation between price and MVRM of 0.19, and correlation between price and MVRM of 0.98, which is extraordinarily high.  *coinmetrics.io This ratio acts as an “equilibrium” gauge of bitcoin’s price to fundamentals valuation, where transaction volume and active addresses both represent “quantity and quality” growth of the bitcoin network; validated by 0.15 and 0.07 correlation between price, respectively. For example, when TAAR and price are closely distributed, price (valuation) and fundamentals are aligned in equilibrium; and when either TAAR or price deviate substantially from each other, price is out of equilibrium which has historically resulted in price devaluation (albeit small sample size). The market’s recent selloff has helped reduce the gap between price and TAAR, which has persisted since Q4 2017.  Correlation to Δprice of 0.13 The 30 day moving average of TAAR is ~$2500 while TAAR daily is ~$2000, thus an “equilibrium” range for price appears between $2,000 and $3,000. *Note: prices seldom mean revert directly to their equilibrium level, they typically over-correct, which makes further price depreciation beyond the stated levels possible. Additionally, as can be seen on the logarithmic chart, price has bounced off TAAR’s 30-day MA twice in 2018 (black boxes), and has most recently rebounded momentarily. The final price flush before finding a stable bottom will likely coincide with price falling beneath the TAAR 30 day MA, price recovering that level, and then TAAR beginning to trend upward once more.  *coinmetrics.io Similar to MVRM, the TAAR to price ratio is an oscillator that visualizes the same dynamic via one ratio. Historically, a ratio of 1.5 and above is undervalued, 1.0 to 2.0 is “safe”, and beneath 1.0 (“equilibrium”) is overvalued. Currently, the oscillator is ~0.70 which still indicates overvaluation, but the overall trend back towards 1.0 is positive.  *coinmetrics.io While the recent price action for bitcoin has been harshly negative, these market clearing events have begun the normalization process for bitcoin’s price valuation, which can be seen in several indicators. Per the MVRM analysis above, if history repeats itself, price will likely fall further, then trade sideways until the end of Q4, then reignite a new bull market. An additional verification of this narrative will be if the TAAR to price oscillator enters undervalued territory above 1.50 in 2019, especially, prior to Q4. *Disclaimer: this article is for educational purposes only and should not be considered investment or trading advice.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) minor pullback from two-week highs could end up fueling a breakout above the key hurdle of $4,140. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value jumped to $4,090 at 17:15 UTC on Sunday – the highest level since Dec. 24 – validating the short-term bullish reversal confirmed on Dec. 20. Even so, the positive momentum has weakened slightly in the last 36 hours. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,995 on Bitstamp, having clocked a low of $3,934 earlier today. The 3 percent correction from two-week highs, however, has carved out a bull flag on the technical charts. Put simply, the pattern often represents a pause in a rally and can accelerate the preceding bullish move. So, it seems safe to say that the price pullback has pushed up the odds of an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout above $4,140.  BTC has created a bull flag pattern – a bullish continuation setup – on the 4-hour chart. A 4-hour close above the upper edge of the flag, currently at $4,005, would confirm a bull breakout. That would signal a revival of the rally from the Jan. 6 low of $3,753 and would open the doors to $4,340 (target as per the measured move method). Essentially, the flag breakout could end up yielding an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout above the neckline of $4,140. More importantly, higher lows (marked by red arrows) at $3,566 (Dec. 27 low), $3,629 (Jan. 1 low) and $3,753 (Jan. 6 low) indicate that the bulls are in control. Therefore, crossing the flag resistance should not be a tough task.  As seen above, BTC is taking the support of the 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs), validating the short-term bullish setup indicated by these upward sloping averages. The 14-day relative strength index is holding in bullish territory above 50.00 and prices seem to have found acceptance above the 50-day MA hurdle. The path of least resistance, therefore, is to the higher side. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Past performance is no guarantee of future results, but when history repeats it can be difficult to ignore the potential implications. Such is the case with price chart of ether, the ethereum network’s native cryptocurrency. Since Sept. 2018, the price chart of the world’s second largest cryptocurrency has mimicked the market structure of bitcoin’s bear market bottom in 2015.  In the world of technical analysis and trading, similar and repeating market structures are known as fractals, similar to the recurring patterns found in art, nature and mathematics.  The two emotions of fear and greed are what drives price action in a market, so repeated investor behavior yielding similar results may not be that far-fetched, especially when those emotions create fractals in the cryptocurrency market.  The above chart depicts the eerie fractal from BTC’s bottom in 2015 (upper frame) playing out on the ETH/BTC chart (lower frame).  Needless the say, the structure of the two charts are nearly identical, with only minor discrepancies.  As can be seen, going from left to right, both assets printed a “V” shaped bottom followed by a minor rally and subsequent bearish trendline breakdown.  After the trendline break, both markets endured a period of abnormally low volatility compared to their typically erratic nature.  As the old saying in investing goes: “never short a dull market”. These periods are commonly found to be when markets store – or accumulate – energy before a significant advance.  Larger players also tend to lose interest in boring markets, leaving just the smaller retail traders who, in large part, favor long over short positions, in turn creating a market that favors the bulls. Following the dull market, both BTC and ETH produced a minor rally followed by another sell-off, as depicted by the blue downward curved lines.  Both markets quickly rebounded in a curved bottom fashion, driving the price to a “V” shaped top, lastly followed by bullish continuation from the previous rebound.  Indeed, the similarities are striking, but there are differences between the two that may play spoilsport to the fractal actually playing out. According to stock market legend Richard D. Wyckoff, price charts abide by a law of “cause and effect.” In other words, the longer the trend stays sideways A.K.A. “the cause,” the more powerful and long lasting the subsequent trend, A.K.A. “the effect” – another reason shorting a dull market can be risky. This is particularly relevant here since the cause for BTC’s 2015 bottom was nearly an entire year long, whereas ETH’s cause is so far just over three months.  Taking that into account, it could be argued that a long-term uptrend would be an unlikely result if ETH/BTC keeps advancing since its cause is considerably smaller than BTC’s was. A bullish effect is still possible, though – just perhaps one that is more proportional to its 3-month cause.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) bears would be put on the back foot if prices climb past key resistance lined up at $4,140. The leading cryptocurrency jumped to a two-week high of $4,090 earlier today, as expected, ending a weeklong period of low volume consolidation near $3,800. Notably, the break above $4,000 has added further credence to the short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by the three-day chart on Dec. 20. The job, however, is only half done for bulls, as prices are yet to take out the resistance at $4,140 – the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern. A convincing break above that level would put the bulls back into the driver’s seat. That said, a longer-term bullish reversal would be confirmed only above the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) of $5,567. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $4,000 on Bitstamp, representing a 5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. As seen above, BTC has charted an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, which represents a transition from the bear market to the bull market – a low followed by recovery (left shoulder), a bearish-lower low and recovery (head), and finally a bullish-higher low and recovery (right shoulder). A breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders usually yields a powerful move to the upside. BTC, therefore, could rise well above $5,000 (target as per the measured move method) if the neckline resistance, currently seen at $4,140, is crossed on the back of high trading volumes. Further, the cryptocurrency has found acceptance above the 50-day moving average (MA) hurdle, while the 5- and 10-day MAs are trending north, indicating a bullish setup. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is also biased toward the bulls. Hence, prospects of a bull breakout above $4,140 appear high.  On the monthly chart, the outlook remains bearish while BTC is trading below the 21-month EMA of $5,567. Interestingly, the trendline connecting the December 2017 and November 2017 highs is also located near the 21-month EMA. Forcing a long-run breakout, therefore, is going to be an uphill task for the bulls – more so, as both the 5- and 10-month EMAs are still trending south, indicating a bearish setup. As a result, these averages – currently are located at $4,791 and $5,651, respectively – could work as stiff resistance levels.

" Angus Champion de Crespigny is an advisor to blockchain projects and a former EY blockchain lead. The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.   Amongst many others, the bitcoin community for the past few years has been working with two particularly important ideas related to the asset’s future. One is the narrative of institutional adoption: the idea that institutions will begin buying (or facilitating the buying) of bitcoin as an investment. The other is decentralization: emphasizing control of one’s own monetary sovereignty and the ease with which people can participate in the network at an affordable cost. While both are important in their own ways, considering how institutions operate, it is likely that these two narratives are going to conflict. This does not need to be a problem, however. What we’re likely to see is a bifurcation in bitcoin usage throughout the world for different purposes, and consequently, how it is handled. This thesis comes from a number of different directions. There is what I’ll call the “hard money” thesis: that bitcoin will be recognized as a superior form of money due to its monetary policy and will be adopted en masse by institutional investors. In this case, these investors are the likes of pension funds, endowment funds, insurers and, possibly, central banks. Part of institutional adoption, however, is looking beyond the underlying benefits of the asset, and into whether there’s an appetite for people to buy, sell, hold and trade bitcoin. Where there is an appetite for a financial asset, institutions will facilitate. In this case, the investors will also include individuals. The challenge faced by institutions in working with bitcoin in either instance, though, is that financial instruments for institutions need to be boring. Institutions rarely custody their own assets. Over many years, custody functions have been centralized with specialized institutions in the financial sector, who will hold the assets and perform all management functions that are needed on behalf of the ultimate asset owners. But for bitcoin, custody is challenging, and not just for the technical reason that private keys need to be secure. How do institutions manage forks? Do they need a central clearing function to offset risk? How do they manage sanctions risks for transaction fees if a block is mined by a miner in a sanctioned country? For institutions to hold the keys is rarely operationally sensible: few financial institutions have the expertise in-house nor have the appetite to take on such a technically complex process. Consequently, for institutions to get on board with bitcoin, these issues will need to be addressed, and they will likely be addressed in the same way that the management of financial instruments usually are – with standards and centralized products. These standards may define what forks to accept and processes to follow to manage sanctions risks, which the industry will want to ensure is in line with peers to manage perceptions to clients and regulators. Centralized products managed by specialized companies may include custodians and clearing houses: we’re starting to see this already. While there is opposition to this centralization, and in particular how certain custodians manage forks, the reality is that few financial institutions, at least in the short term, have a desire to undertake this side of digital asset management. Many seasoned bitcoiners object to this centralization. And rightly so, at a technical level. What’s the point in censorship resistant money if you standardize and centralize it such that it can be censored? As recently covered in Time, bitcoin is effective for freedom because it allows people to store money away from a government they don’t trust. If there is a demand to keep money away from the government and bitcoin is effective in doing that, then naturally countries to which this is applicable will wish to restrict its usage. We have already seen such controls with Zimbabwe and China. For such usage, bitcoin must be decentralized. Centralized custodians, clearing houses, and standards organizations can be influenced by such jurisdictions through law enforcement and consequently will not be held up to be censorship resistant. Now, if bitcoin for some reason is not effective as a tool for freedom, it is unlikely to adopted as such, in which case this whole discussion is moot. As much as I can probably assume that the reader is a fan of bitcoin and bullish for its eventual disruptive power, we should be pragmatic about the obstacles to it being adopted as a store of value. It will need to significantly improve in its ease of use, particularly around key management. It will need a reduction in perceived volatility, and liquidity in these countries that need censorship resistant money, that by their nature likely have capital controls restricting money movement. Ultimately, we will need a shift in perception to bitcoin being seen as a store of value on par with or superior to gold – which is no mean feat in itself. So while I’m optimistic we can get there, we may well have a long road. If Bitcoin is successful in achieving this status, the logical conclusion is that we would expect bitcoin to hold a dual status globally. In countries where people have greater faith in the rule of law and central banks, censorship resistance is less attractive, and thus bitcoin could be seen as an investible commodity akin to gold with the majority of assets held in centralized institutions. In parts of the world under oppressive regimes, however, bitcoin may be closer to an illegal or at the very least highly restricted asset, where there would need to be a greater emphasis and need of self-management of wallets and keys. It would certainly be exciting if it was use in those countries that drove the price for the rest of the world. Centralization of bitcoin products and services are not in and of themselves bad, as there will be a different demand for the asset from different markets. It is critical, however, that bitcoin at its base remains a decentralized, censorship-resistant medium of value transfer and storage: as without censorship resistance, we don’t have an innovation at all.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent pullback from highs above $4,200 could trap the bears on the wrong side of the market, the price-volume analysis indicates. The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $3,848, having clocked a low of $3,642 on Dec. 28. At that level, BTC was down 14.7 percent from the Dec. 24 high of $4,272, according to CoinMarketCap. Notably, daily trading volumes across all cryptocurrency exchanges have also dropped in the last few days. At press time, 24-hour trading volume stands at $4.57 billion – down 36 percent from the Dec. 24 high of at $7.24 billion. A low-volume price pullback is widely considered a sign of weak buyers exiting the market and hence is considered insignificant. The recent drop, therefore, is likely a temporary correction and the bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by the 3-day chart on Dec. 20 is still valid. The bullish case, however, would weaken if the cryptocurrency dips below the key support near $3,550. As seen above (prices as per Bitstamp), BTC closed at $4,073 on Dec. 20, confirming a bullish outside-candle reversal (bear-to-bull change). So far, however, the follow-through has been discouraging. Prices have dropped in the last ten days, but so have volumes. The bullish reversal, however, would be invalidated if and when the bullish-higher low of $3,566 carved out on Dec. 27 is breached.  The triangle breakout seen in the 6-hour chart indicates that the rally from the December low of $3,122 has resumed. Meanwhile, the bull flag breakout seen in the hourly chart indicates a resumption of the rally from the Jan. 1 low of $3,629. Therefore, the path of least resistance is on the higher side.  On the daily chart, BTC is likely carving out an inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern with the neckline resistance at $4,170. The bullish setup on the 3-day and intraday chart indicates scope for a test of $4,170 in the next few days. It is worth noting that the 50-day moving average (MA) is still trending south, indicating a bearish setup. As a result, BTC may attract bears if the MA hurdle, currently at $3,900, proves to be a tough nut to crack in the next 48 hours or so.

" Bitcoin (BTC) could test a key resistance line for the first time in nearly two months. The widely followed 50-day simple moving average (SMA) line is currently located at $3,940 – $100 above bitcoin’s current price of $3,840 – according to Bitstamp data. The crucial SMA line was last put to test on Nov. 8. Back then, the SMA was located at $6,450 and was serving as a stiff resistance. On Nov. 14, BTC nosedived below $6,000, putting the bears back into the driver’s seat.  As a result, the gap between the 50-day SMA line and price widened sharply in the following two weeks. Notably, on Nov. 25, the 50-day MA line was located at least $2500 above price. That spread, however, has narrowed sharply in the last two weeks, indicating waning bearish pressures. Further, price chart analysis indicates that the bulls have won control, at least for the short-term. BTC, therefore, could test and possibly break above the 50-day SMA line of $3,940 in the next day or two.  As seen above, BTC ran into offers near the 50-day SMA earlier today. Notably, at 00:05 UTC, BTC was trading $40 short of the 50-day SMA. Despite the pullback from intraday highs near $3,900, the outlook remains bullish, as the positive divergence of the relative strength index (RSI), confirmed on Dec. 18, is still valid. Further, 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) are beginning to curl upwards. The RSI is also biased bullish above 50.00. The 50-day SMA is indeed trending south, indicating a bearish setup. The long-term averages, however, are lagging indicators. As a result, the price action always supersedes the long-term moving average lines. It is worth noting that a break above the 50-day SMA, if confirmed, would open the doors to $4,170 – neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. The 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) is also located just below the neckline hurdle. So, $4,170 is the level to beat for the bulls.  The triangle breakout seen in the 6-hour chart indicates that the rally from the December low of $3,122 has resumed. The RSI is printing bullish levels above 50.00. Meanwhile, the stacking order of the 50-candle MA above the 100-candle MA is also a classic bull indicator. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin (BTC) chalked up its longest monthly losing streak in seven years in December. The leading cryptocurrency by market value closed at $3,689 on Dec. 31, representing a 13 percent drop from the monthly opening price of $4,241. That was the fifth straight monthly loss – its worst period since November 2011 – according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Back then, BTC was trading below $20 and had depreciated by 81 percent in five months to November 2011. Notably, the tide had turned in favor of the bulls in the following months. BTC gained 59 percent in December 2011 and traded at record highs above $900 in November 2013. Bitcoin may repeat history by posting gains this month. After all, the cryptocurrency is looking oversold, having lost 52 percent in the last five months and 70 percent in 2018. Further, it is currently down 80 percent from the record high of $20,000 seen in December 2017. The follow-through, however, may lack vigor, as key fundamental metrics are still biased toward the bears. For instance, the widely followed network value transmitted (NVT) ratio of 108 is still reporting overbought conditions. Further, on technical charts, a long run bullish reversal would be confirmed above the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) of $5,547. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,790 on Bitstamp – up 1.86 percent on a 24-hour basis.  Bitcoin is likely charting an inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern on the daily chart with the neckline resistance at 4,180. A UTC close above that level would open the doors to $5,200 (target as per the measured move method). More importantly, the resistance at $4,180 could be put to test soon as the 3-day chart is biased toward the bulls.  As seen above, BTC is holding well above the December low of $3,122. Therefore, the bullish view put forward by the positive divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) in mid-December is still valid.  On the 4-hour chart, the 100-candle moving average (MA) is located by the 200-candle MA, indicating the path of least resistance is on the higher side. The chart also shows a falling channel breakout – a bullish pattern. BTC, therefore, could re-test recent highs above $4,200.

" Exhale. The nightmare of the 2018 cryptocurrency market is finally over.  Of course, more downside is always possible, if not likely, but at least the year in which bitcoin prices dropped more than 80 percent and the broarder market lost nearly $700 billion of total capitalization is over.  By now, you’re probably well aware the world’s premier cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC), catapulted more than 2,500 percent from its 2017 low to reach a new high of almost $20,000 by December of that year.  Unfortunately for those at the time who were betting on more immediate upside, one of bitcoin’s many speculative bubbles or “hype cycles” reached its peak on Dec. 17, 2017 and its price has been trapped in a steep and record-setting downtrend ever since.  What exactly transpired for the price of bitcoin over the past 365 volatile days is explored below.  Price History When reviewing bitcoin’s 2018 price history, two technical developments stand out: the moving average death cross and breaking support of $6,000.  Moving averages are exactly what the name suggests – an average of bitcoin’s price over specified time periods that when plotted on a chart tend to provide support and resistance for price, as well as the strength and bias of the longer term trend. Multiple moving averages are commonly used on the same chart and complete the bearish development known as a ‘death cross’ when a major short-term moving average crosses below a major long-term moving average, indicating a significant loss of strength to the longer term trend.  BTC/USD witnessed a death cross between the 100- and 200-day moving averages on April 16, confirming the end of its most recent bull market. Before the death cross had taken place, price fell to and found support near $6,000 in February.  All eyes were on this level from that day forward as price went on to test it several more times before finally breaking down nine months later on Nov. 14.   Up until this point, many believed $6k had fortified itself as the ‘bottom’ of the 2018 bear market since it had been strongly defended for what in crypto time seemed like an eternity. Coincidentally, Nov. 14 was the day before one of the world’s largest crypto-networks, bitcoin cash (BCH), underwent a divisive hard fork, which many suspect provided enough uncertainty in the broader market to catalyze bitcoin’s break below $6,000. Now having closed the year at the price of $3,747, 2018 will go in the record books as bitcoin’s worst performing 12-month stretch ever in terms of price.  The leading cryptocurrency’s 2018 performance of a more than 70-percent depreciation from its opening price of $13,062 is considerably worse than the previous record holder, 2014, the year when its price fell roughly 55 percent open to close, according to CoinDesk’s pricing data. Trading Volume  Bitcoin monthly trading volume peaked towards the end of 2017, bringing in a total of $70.2 billion across exchanges in November just before its price reached an all-time high, according to data from Bitcoinity. Trading volumes, along with price, have been stuck in a downtrend ever since and for all of 2018.  Just $7.8 billion in monthly trading volume was recorded in September – a stark difference and 88 percent drop from the high recorded in Nov. 2017 and a 15-month low at the time. The volume performance for 2018 isn’t all discouraging, however.  Using data from Coinmarketcap, a post from Satoshi Capital Research revealed over $2 trillion worth of bitcoin was traded in 2018, which as of Dec. 1 marked a 61 percent increase from the previous year.  While it’s not quite the 96 percent increase recorded in 2017 over 2016, it’s clear investor interest still grew substantially in 2018 despite the relentless bearish market conditions.  NVT Ratio There are plenty of other tools that can be used to evaluate bitcoin’s 2018 market conditions besides technical analysis. Our favorites of which are those created by cryptocurrency researcher Willy Woo that focus on various bitcoin blockchain metrics and its relation to price and network value, like the NVT Ratio. The network value transmitted (NVT) ratio emulates the price to earnings ratio (P/E) used to value a company’s stock price by comparing bitcoin’s network value (market capitalization) and the value of funds transmitted through its blockchain.  A ratio above 100 suggests bitcoin’s price has outstripped its network value, or in other words has become overbought. Conversely, a reading below 100 indicates the market is representing a truer value for bitcoin where price is at less risk of witnessing an aggressive and elongated downtrend.  As can be seen in the above chart, bitcoin’s NVT ratio was well above 100 for almost all of 2018 and even reached its highest level since 2011 above 200, confirming the market was significantly overvalued and a drop in price and network value was highly likely.  Now at the year end, bitcoin has witnessed a near 80 percent drop in network value, falling from $280 billion to $56 billion. While the downtrend is still aggressive, the daily estimated value transmitted through its blockchain stopped plummeting in May and has stabilized above roughly $250 million ever since, allowing the NVT ratio to finally begin deflating.  At the time of writing, bitcoin’s NVT ratio records 108, so the market is still slightly overbought but is much closer to finding a healthy bottom than it was earlier in the year. If the bear market experienced in 2014-15 is any example, the NVT ratio will once again need to stabilize for several months below 100 before another sustained uptrend can begin. It should be noted Blockstream’s liquid side-chain was launched on Oct. 10 which takes some bitcoin volume off-chain so not all transmitted volume is being taken into account in the NVT ratio.  Looking forward   Indeed, 2018 was a historically bad year for bitcoin if solely price action and network value are being taken into account.  Other metrics though, like total trading volume, show a substantial increase in investor interest from the prior year, whereas the NVT ratio shows bitcoin’s latest bubble is coming close to being fully deflated.  All in all, 2019 will be an interesting year for bitcoin as valuations deflate and continue to align with fundamental principles.  Simply put, bitcoin’s market in 2019 can’t possibly be worse than 2018, right? Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st, and AMP at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin (BTC) is looking increasingly bullish on a key technical chart following its strong move above $4,000. The leading cryptocurrency by market value first teased bullish reversal on Dec. 17 with the creation of an “outside reversal” candle on the widely followed 3-day chart. The early indicator of a bearish-to-bullish trend change, however, needed confirmation in the form of a positive follow-through. Alongside BTC’s $600 rally, the cryptocurrency closed above $4,000 yesterday confirming the bullish reversal on the 3-day chart. BTC, therefore, could rise to next major resistance of $4,400 in the near-term. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $4,000 on Bitstamp, largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis.  Confirmation of the bearish-to-bullish trend change can be seen on the 3-day chart above, where the last candle has ended well above $3,590 – the high of Monday’s outside reversal candle. Adding credence to that positive trend change is BTC’s move above the 10-candle exponential moving average (EMA) yesterday. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has jumped into undersold territory, validating a bullish divergence created on Dec. 15.  On the daily chart, BTC created a “gravestone doji” candle on Wednesday – widely considered an early sign of bearish reversal. The recovery rally from 15-month lows near $3,100 would likely have ended had BTC closed yesterday below $3,642 (Wednesday’s low). The cryptocurrency, however, closed well above $3,924 (high of gravestone doji), reinforcing the bullish view put forward by Tuesday’s convincing close above $3,633. Other technical studies are also biased toward the bulls. For instance, the 5- and 10-day EMAs are trending north and the 14-day RSI is holding well above 50.00.

" Bitcoin’s ongoing recovery rally faces a major obstacle that could impede progress towards $5,000, according to the technical charts. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization jumped to a two-week high of $4,108 earlier today, validating the short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change confirmed earlier this week. Notably, the break above the psychological hurdle of $4,000 looks sustainable, as 24-hour trading volume has jumped to one-month highs above $8 billion. As a result, more bargain hunters could join the party, creating further upward pressure on prices. Even so, the rally may stall near $4,400 for some time, as the area around that psychological level is packed with key technical lines. As of writing, BTC is trading at $4,040 on Bitstamp, representing an 8 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  The above chart shows: The relative strength index (RSI) on the hourly and 4-hour charts is now reporting overbought conditions, too. All this combined, BTC will likely have a tough time scaling the stiff resistance zone of $4,400-$4,430 in a single attempt. Moreover, a consolidation or a minor pullback from the current level of $4,040 will allow the RSI on the hourly and 4-hour chart to roll over from the overbought territory and realign in favor of the bulls. That, if confirmed, could ease BTC’s progress across the resistance zone. As a result, the move past that crucial resistance could yield a quick rally to the next psychological barrier of 5,000 Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) relief rally gathered pace on Thursday, pushing prices to two-week highs above the psychological hurdle of $4,000. The cryptocurrency rose to a high of $4,067 at 09:06 UTC – a level last seen on Dec. 4 – according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Its market capitalization also hit a two-week high of $70 billion. At press time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at $4,000 – up 28 percent from the 15-month low of $3,122 reached earlier this week. The recovery rally was overdue as BTC had been looking extremely oversold as its value dropped by 50 percent over the last four weeks. The bounce in the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is again boding well for the broader markets. As of writing, names like ether, XRP, stellar and litecoin are all reporting 2 percent gains, as per CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin cash (ABC/SV combined) is up 30 percent and lesser-known cryptocurrencies like stratis and Chainlink have gained 45 percent and 27 percent, respectively, in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the list of cryptos posting losses today includes maker and linkey, both of which are down 5 percent. Bitcoin’s move above $4,000 validates the bullish setup seen in the short-term technical charts. As a result, the focus now is on the next major resistance lined up at $4,400 (Dec. 29 high).

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) price crossed key resistance yesterday, boosting the prospects of a stronger rally above $4,000. The leading cryptocurrency by market value broke out of a bearish descending pattern and closed above key resistance at $3,633 yesterday. That came after picking up a strong bid on the anniversary of its 2017 all-time price high on Monday. Tuesday’s close has also pushed up the probability of a bullish three-day close above $3,590 being confirmed on Thursday. So, with the short-term picture looking bullish, the focus shifts to the next major resistance levels lined up at $4,000 (psychological hurdle) and $4,410 (Nov. 29 high). BTC is currently trading at $3,750 on Bitstamp, having clocked a two-week high of $3,776 earlier today. The cryptocurrency has recovered 20 percent from the recent low of $3,122 but is still down 73 percent on a year-to-date basis. BTC’s close above $3,633 on the daily chart bolstered the increasingly bullish technical setup, as represented by the positive divergence of the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) and the high-volume falling wedge breakout. Further evidence that the bears have weakened is a bullish crossover between the 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs).  On the hourly chart, the bull flag breakout confirmed yesterday created room for a rally to $3,840 (pole height added to breakout price). Both the rising trendline and the stacking order of the simple moving averages (SMAs) also favor an extension of the ongoing rally.  The outlook as per the monthly chart would turn bullish if and when prices beat the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month EMA, currently at $5,728.

" Bitcoin (BTC) could be in for a stronger recovery rally ahead of New Year as the recent major sell-off looks to be fading. The leading cryptocurrency by market value had been trading near $3,200 early yesterday, representing an 83 percent drop from the record high of $20,000 reached the same date in 2017. However, BTC, which had been ignoring extreme oversold conditions for weeks and struggling to pick up a bid, suddenly jumped to an eight-day high of $3,590 from around 12:00 UTC. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $3,450 on Bitstamp. With the bounce, BTC has not only validated the oversold readings on the 14-week relative strength index (RSI), but also established a bullish reversal pattern on the widely followed three-day chart.  BTC has created a bullish outside reversal candle, meaning the price action seen during the three days to Dec. 17 engulfed the previous three-day candle’s high and low. The candlestick pattern suggests that the time span began pessimistically, but ended on an optimistic note. It is widely considered an early sign of bullish reversal, especially when the pattern appears at the bottom of the downtrend. A bearish-to-bullish trend change, however, would only be confirmed if the current three-day candle ends (Thursday’s UTC close) above $3,590 (high of the bullish outside candle). Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has created a bullish divergence (higher low) in oversold territory below 30.00. Trading volumes have also dropped in the last two weeks, signaling that sellers have run out of steam. As a result of all this, BTC looks likely to rise well above $3,590 ahead of Thursday’s close.  BTC closed on the daily chart yesterday at $3,596, confirming both a falling wedge breakout – a bullish reversal pattern – and a bullish divergence of the 14-day RSI. The 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) have also bottomed out. BTC could therefore attack the recent lower high of $3,633 in the next few days and extend gains toward $4,000.

" Bitcoin (BTC) is still struggling to find the bottom of a bear market on the anniversary of its $20,000 all-time record price high. At press time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at $3,230 on Bitstamp – down 83.5 percent from the record high of $20,000 reached on Dec. 17, 2017. BTC is also down 76 percent on a year-to-date basis (from its opening price of $13,880 on Jan. 1) and is on track to end its three-year winning streak. The picture, however, was remarkably different in the fourth quarter of the last year. The cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid on Nov. 1, 2017, on speculation that the imminent listing of bitcoin futures products on major US exchanges would open the floodgates for institutional money. Back then, BTC was trading above $6,000. Notably, the “fear of missing out” (FOMO) established a self-feeding cycle of more investors joining the party, leading to an even bigger rise in price. By Dec. 17, BTC was trading at $20,000 and was seen rising to dizzy heights this year. Such was the frenzy that Ari Paul, current CIO of Blocktower Capital, purchased 12-month call options with a strike price of $50,000 for $1 million. Call options give holders the right to buy the underlying cryptocurrency at an agreed price on or before a particular date. Paul was essentially betting that BTC would rise to $50,000 by Dec. 28, 2018. The bubble, however, burst in the first quarter of this year and prices have been generally falling ever since. As a result, that now-worthless call option is set to expire next Friday. BTC’s slide from $20,000 to $3,200 could be categorized in the following phases: Sell the fact: BTC closed last year at $13,880 – down 44 percent from the $20,000 high seen on Dec. 17 – possibly due to profit taking on long positions initiated in the run-up to the futures listings. Most experts called it a “sell the fact” scenario and dismissed it as nothing more than a healthy correction. Bubble shrinks: The effects of regulatory clampdowns in China and South Korea weighed heavily over bitcoin’s price early in Q1. Both nations were the biggest sources of demand for cryptocurrencies before the restrictions. Prices subsequently fell to $6,000 on Feb. 6 and closed near $7,000 on Mar. 31. Bear breather: BTC spent a better part of the second quarter and the entire third quarter defending the psychological level of $6,000. Notably, the key support level held ground in the third quarter, despite the decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) to reject BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As a result, experts, including the likes of billionaire investor Novogratz, were convinced that BTC had bottomed out around $6,000. Losses resume: BTC’s inability to produce a notable price bounce despite the repeated defense of $6,000 proved costly. Prices nosedived below the critical 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) support on Nov. 14, signaling a resumption of the sell-off from the record high of $20,000. BTC hit a 15-month low of $3,122 over the weekend and is showing little signs of life below the 21-month EMA. The short-duration, technical charts, however, are signaling scope for a minor price bounce.  The above chart shows BTC’s journey from the record highs a year ago to recent 15-month lows near $3,100. The outlook as per the monthly chart would turn bullish, if and when BTC crosses the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month EMA, currently at $5,719.  BTC’s daily chart shows a “sideways” breach of the falling wedge resistance, meaning the breakout is not convincing. As a result, a more credible evidence of a bullish reversal is needed, possibly in the form a high-volume break above $3,633 (high of the 3-day inverted hammer candle). That could yield a stronger corrective rally to levels above $4,000. BTC/USD long positions on Bitfinex rose to 35,773 BTC earlier today – a level last seen on July 23. More importantly, the longs have risen by 33 percent in the last six days. That could be an indication that bargain hunters are paying heed to extreme oversold conditions reported by the 14-week relative strength index (RSI). BTC, therefore, could witness a corrective bounce ahead of the year’s end. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled to 15-month lows earlier today, dashing hopes of a rally signaled by current extreme oversold conditions. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell to $3,200 on Bitstamp at 00:15 UTC – the lowest level since September 2017. BTC was trapped in a five-day-long narrowing price range 24 hours ago and showed signs that it might break upwards with a strong move toward the crucial resistance at $3,633. These bullish expectations were based largely on a premise that the sellers are facing exhaustion, as indicated by the 14-week relative strength index (RSI), having engineered a 49 percent price drop in the last four weeks. Further, evidence of bargain hunting had emerged earlier this week in the form of a three-day inverted hammer candle. Even so, BTC dived out of the narrowing price range in U.S. trading hours yesterday, killing the prospects of a short-term inverted hammer bullish reversal above $3,633. BTC’s persistent failure to produce a notable price bounce despite extreme oversold conditions indicates that the bearish sentiment is very strong. As a result, a convincing break below the 200-week moving average (MA) support of $3,170 cannot be ruled out. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $3,250 on Bitstamp, representing a 2 percent decline on a 24-hour basis. The symmetrical triangle breakdown seen in the 4-hour chart indicates a resumption of the sell-off from the Nov. 29 high of $4,410. The stacking order of the 50-candle moving average (MA), below the 100-candle MA, below the 200-candle SMA, is a classic bear indicator. The RSI has also fallen back into bearish territory below 50.00. BTC, therefore, risks falling to the psychological level of $3,000. On the way lower, it may encounter support at $3,179 (200-week MA).  As seen above, BTC has charted lower price highs (marked by arrows) along the downward sloping 10-day exponential moving average (EMA). Notably, BTC persistently failed to close above that EMA hurdle at the end of the last month. Hence, the 10-day EMA, currently at $3,465, is the level to beat for the bulls.

" Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating below $3,500 for the third day straight. The challenge now is to gauge whether the bulls or the bears will win out in the coming days. As discussed yesterday, the leading cryptocurrency could soon see a corrective rally if prices manage to clear the crucial resistance at $3,633 (the high of an “inverted hammer” candle on the 3-day chart) by Friday’s UTC close. The bull case is also bolstered by bitcoin’s 14-week relative strength index, which is reporting oversold conditions for the first time since January 2015. A corrective rally, therefore, looks overdue. The odds of a move above $3,633 would rise if BTC’s five-day-long narrowing price range ends with a bullish breakout. As of writing, the upper edge of the price range is located at $3,456 and the lower edge is seen at $3,360. However, it’s worth remembering that BTC has repeatedly struggled to score a significant and lasting rally in recent weeks, despite the very oversold conditions. BTC is currently trading at $3,400 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.75 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  BTC has created a symmetrical triangle (narrowing price range) on the hourly chart. A bull breakout would validate the argument put forward by the 3-day inverted hammer candle that bargain hunters are beginning to challenge the bears’ resolve to push prices lower. As a result, the triangle breakout, if confirmed, could yield a quick move higher to $3,633. BTC, however, risks falling to the 200-week moving average (MA) of $3,179 if prices pierce the triangle support of $3,360. That long-term MA support will likely hold ground, as the 14-week RSI is reporting extreme oversold conditions.  Many market technicians believe that a break of an RSI trendline often precedes the break of a trendline in price. Going by that logic, the falling channel breakout in the 6-hour chart RSI could be considered an advance warning of an impending bullish price move.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) struggle to build a notable bounce could end if prices beat key resistance above $3,600. The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell to 15-month lows near $3,200 last week, pushing the 14-week relative strength index (RSI) below 30.00 for the first time since 2015. So, with bitcoin so extremely oversold, a recovery rally cannot be ruled out – more so because there is evidence of bargain hunters challenging the bears’ resolve to push prices lower. For instance, BTC posted a three-day candle on Dec. 8 that closed below support at $3,463 (low of multiple three-day candles in September 2017), bolstering the already bearish technical setup. Despite that, BTC not only avoided a drop to $3,000 in the last 72 hours but also hit a high of $3,633, if briefly. Nevertheless, the fact that prices were able to defy the bearish setup indicates that the bulls are beginning to flex a little muscle. Therefore, a stronger rally could unfold if prices manage to cross the newfound resistance of $3,633 in the next 48 hours or so. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,414 on Bitstamp, having clocked a low of $3,325 earlier today.  As seen above, bitcoin has charted an “inverted hammer” candle, which occurs when prices see a brief rally during a downtrend. It is widely considered a sign of potential trend reversal. The bullish reversal, however, would be confirmed if the follow-through is positive, that is, the current 3-day candle needs to close above $3,633 on Friday. That could see prices open up upside toward the psychological resistance of $4,000.  On the daily chart, the 14-day RSI has posted a higher low as opposed to the lower low on price, meaning the indicator is diverging in favor of the bulls. However, again, a high-volume move above $3,633 is needed to confirm a short-term bullish reversal. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" A key long-term bitcoin (BTC) price indicator is reporting oversold conditions for the first time in almost four years. The widely followed 14-week relative strength index (RSI), which oscillates between zero to 100, is currently seen at 29.80 – a level last seen in January 2015. An asset or a cryptocurrency is considered to be oversold if the RSI is holding below 30.00. On the other hand, an above-70 reading indicates overbought conditions. Essentially, the under-30 reading on the 14-week RSI indicates that the recent heavy selling from the highs above $6,200 may have reached a point of exhaustion. As a result, BTC may defend the immediate support at $3,179 (200-week moving average) in the short-run. Many experts also believe that RSI’s drop below 30.00 is followed by a strong corrective bounce. That’s not necessarily true as some markets enter into very strong trends, in which case the RSI can stay oversold or overbought for prolonged periods of times. Notably, BTC’s ongoing bear market is looking quite resilient, as the sell-off is backed by strong volumes. Hence, a strong bounce could remain elusive for some time, despite the oversold readings on the 14-week RSI. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,390 on Bitstamp, representing a 2.3 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  The RSI dropped below the key support of 53.00 on the weekly chart in late January, signaling a bullish-to-bearish trend change. As of now, it’s holding in oversold territory below 30.00. It is worth noting that RSI’s January 2015 drop below 30.00 was short-lived and BTC soon picked up a bid in response to the oversold conditions.  On the daily chart, the immediate outlook remains bearish as long as BTC is trading below the descending trendline. BTC failed to cut through the diagonal resistance yesterday, adding credence to the bearish setup on the 3-day chart. So too, do the 5- and 10-day MAs which are trending south.

" While many traders eagerly await a potential bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), some of the cryptocurrency’s most passionate advocates are lukewarm at best about the prospect of such an instrument. Twitter is flush with users like crypto entrepreneur Jonathan Hamel posting about how an ETF would bring an “epic” inflow of institutional capital to the ecosystem – that is, “billions” of dollars in new investments. But if you talk to early adopters and veteran technologists in the bitcoin community, you’ll hear resounding indifference, if not queasiness. “I don’t think an ETF is going to be some kind of massive magnet,” Pierre Rochard, founder of the Brooklyn-based Bitcoin Advisory LLC, told CoinDesk. “Demand will continue to be driven by sentiment, rather than the availability of specific products.” Last week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange postponed plans to reevaluate ETF proposals from financial institutions such as VanEck and SolidX to as late as February 27, 2019. This means two more months of nail-biting for those who believe the ETF would be a huge boon to bitcoin or the savior of the overall crypto marketplace. And yet, in reference to Grayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust, which launched in 2015, bitcoin analyst Nik Bhatia told CoinDesk: “I don’t see the additional ETFs improving bitcoin’s liquidity any more than the GBTC already does.” Although Bhatia said he would nevertheless welcome a regulator-approved ETF because it might increase public trust in this new asset class, some crypto veterans went as far as to say an ETF could actually be harmful to the broader ecosystem. To them, an ETF contradicts the vision of a peer-to-peer financial network fueled by self-custodied assets. “It’s kind of a centralizing force and the value proposition of bitcoin is it’s decentralized, global,” Lightning Labs developer Alex Bosworth told CoinDesk. For Bosworth, the biggest risk that a bitcoin ETF presents is that it might incentivize institutions to work collectively to influence the ecosystem. Referring to the thwarted New York Agreement in 2017 – when leading crypto companies planned to support unpopular bitcoin network updates simultaneously despite public outcry – Bosworth explained: “We saw companies that are custodians for other people’s coins, talking as if they hold those coins and take actions that decide, on behalf of their users, without even consulting them…We don’t want to have central parties out there negotiating for fundamental rule changes in bitcoin.” This is the same reason that bitcoin veteran Christopher Allen, the former principal architect at Blockstream, distrusts the institutions that are working to create a regulated bitcoin ETF. “The real reason they are doing it is they can play financial games to make them a much higher interest rate than what they would otherwise,” Allen told CoinDesk. “I think there are a lot of implications of that. How do we educate people on what fiduciary responsibility and custody really is?” Bhatia agreed that the industry is transitioning to prioritize a “trusted custody model,” but doesn’t think such institutional products will have a significant impact on cypherpunk traditionalists. “People that currently store their own bitcoin aren’t going to rush into the ETF because they’re not looking for the same things,” he said. Other bitcoin veterans are concerned retail investors are putting more faith in an ETF’s ability to rescue sinking cryptocurrency prices than the prospective product actually deserves. If approved in the near future, Rochard said, he expects bitcoin ETFs would make up an even smaller percentage of the market than gold ETFs, which he estimated represent less than 2 percent of the global gold supply. “We’re talking about a very niche part of the market that would be interested in a bitcoin ETF product,” Rochard said. “It would be even less than gold is used in an ETF because the overall settlement cost of bitcoin is lower than those of physically settling gold.” Others say any boost to the price might be short-lived. During CoinDesk’s Consensus: Invest conference in November, BlockTower Capital’s chief investment officer Ari Paul warned the audience to recall how the addition of bitcoin futures boosted short-term speculation far more than institutional commitment. The price settled back down within months. “If an ETF was launched, it’s not that there would suddenly be massive institutional flows. I think on the announcement you’d get a massive rally,” Paul said. “That’s not because you suddenly get $50 million [in] institutional investors’ money, it’s because speculators price it in.” And it’s important to remember that any euphoria (or anxiety) about a bitcoin ETF is still academic. On December 5, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce told the audience during fireside chat in Washington D.C. not to “hold your breath,” because a regulator-approved bitcoin ETF could still be years away. She added: “I do caution people to not live or die on when a crypto or bitcoin ETF gets approved.” Even if an ETF were to be approved, bitcoin advocates question how this structure – in which a fund owns underlying assets and divides ownership of them into shares – would address the idiosyncrasies of cryptocurrency. For example, what if there’s another fork of the network, like the one that create bitcoin cash last year? “Do they [ETF custodians] give the coins back to people or do they suddenly become an index fund?” Rochard said. “I don’t think there’s a precedent at all [from capital markets], because bitcoin doesn’t have a legal identity and corporations do.” Allen said ETF issuers would need to clarify how they store and tally their bitcoin, so that products representing this underlying assets wouldn’t be loaned out over and over in a process called rehypothecation. As Caitlin Long, co-founder of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, wrote in a Forbes column, rehypothecation is antithetical to the bitcoin ethos because there is a finite bitcoin supply, 21 million at max. As such, there’s no way to bail out lenders if borrowers were owed more bitcoin than the ETF-issuer actually possessed. “Substantively, it’s really not that much different than fractional reserve banking,” Rochard said. However, Gabor Gurbacs, the director of digital asset strategy for VanEck, told CoinDesk his company’s proposal would involve cold storage, daily disclosures to defuse any concerns about rehypothecation, and a handbook of regulator-approved index fund procedures to follow in the case of a bitcoin fork. “We intend to stay true to the core tenets of bitcoin,” Gurbacs said, adding that ETF holders would be primarily exposed to the asset defined by Bitcoin Core unless another chain became dominant and equally secure. “I don’t see any operational issues. I think we’ve figured it out and we’re waiting for the regulators to make a decision on this,” he went on to explain. Like many bitcoin advocates, Rochard said that anything which boosts bitcoin’s overall liquidity – even modestly – is a good thing. On the other hand, he sympathized with the skeptical indifference many technologists feel toward financial institutions. “It would be really unfortunate if people lose sight of why bitcoin has value,” Rochard said. “But it would be such a small part of the market, so there’d be limited impact on that.” Businessman on dart board image via Shutterstock",2018-12-11
" Bitcoin (BTC) still has the potential to drop towards $3,000, despite a minor bounce from 15-month lows seen on Friday. The leading cryptocurrency by market value picked up a bid at $3,210 three days ago –  a level last seen in September 2017. The ensuing corrective bounce, however, seems to have run out of steam, as bitcoin is currently trading at $3,470 on Bitstamp – down 4 percent from yesterday’s high of $3,633. It’s worth noting that prices are currently down more than 80 percent from the record high of $20,000 reached last December. Further, BTC has depreciated close to 47 percent in the last month, forming record oversold conditions. Even so, BTC  is struggling to post a notable price bounce, which indicates bearish sentiment is still strong. As a result, the cryptocurrency is likely to remain on the defensive in the short-term, at least. Notably, the 3-day chart, which can offer a better picture of the broader market trend than the daily and intra-day charts, is indicating room for a drop below the psychological support of $3,000.  As seen above, the previous three-day candle closed below support at $3,463 (low of multiple three-day candles in September 2017), validating both the recent high-volume sell-off from $6,200 and the bearish lower-high pattern carved out along the downward sloping 5-candle moving average (MA) over the last few days. Further, both the recent “death cross” crossover between the 50- and 200-candle MAs and the steeply descending 10-candle MA are indicating a bearish setup. As a result, BTC has potential to test $2,972 (September 2017 low) in the near-term.  Over on the 4-hour chart, BTC is struggling to cut through the descending trendline hurdle (marked in yellow), currently at $3,540. A break above that level could yield a stronger corrective rally to $3,800 (falling trendline hurdle). The RSI, however, has already dived out of the ascending trendline, signaling bearish conditions. BTC, therefore, may have a tough time clearing the immediate resistance at $3,540.

" The pessimistic sentiment around bitcoin prices saw the number of shorts hit a six-week high on Thursday. At press time, BTC/USD short positions on the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex jumped to 37,891 – the highest level since Oct. 15 – and were last seen at 36,996. Notably, shorts have risen by 95 percent in the last three weeks, accompanying BTC’s recent drop to 14-month lows near $3,500. More importantly, the short positions remained elevated above 35,000 during BTC’s oversold bounce from $3,500 to $4,400 and climbed to fresh multi-week highs on Thursday. Further, the long-short ratio of 0.73 is biased toward the bears.  The data indicates that, despite being so deep into the bear market, sellers appear to be showing no signs of exhaustion. As a result, the cryptocurrency may revisit the recent low of $3,474 as hinted in the technical charts. The bearish sentiment, however, could soon reach extremes as the short positions are down just 7 percent from the record high of 40,289 that was reached on on Sept. 19. Moreover, the extreme bearish positioning is widely considered a sign that the sell-off is overdone and often presages a trend reversal. Therefore, the prospects of sudden bullish reversal, similar to the one seen on April 12, would improve substantially once the short positions reach record highs.

" Bitcoin (BTC) remains on the defensive despite a 4-percent recovery from nine-day lows today, but bearish pressure may weaken if prices rise above key resistance near $3,900. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell to $3,629 at 05:00 UTC on Bitstamp – its lowest level since Nov. 27. At press time, the price stood at $3,770, representing a 1.5 percent drop on a 24-hour basis. Despite the quick recovery, the odds appear to be stacked in favor of a drop to recent lows below $3,500. To start with, BTC closed below $3,711 yesterday, invalidating the short-term bullish reversal signaled by last Wednesday’s 11 percent gains. The daily close also added credence to the bearish lower high carved out near $4,400 in the last few days. Added to that, the bearish setup on the long duration charts suggests strong potential for a deeper sell-off. That said, a minor recovery rally could be seen if prices cross resistance at $3,882 – upper edge of the falling wedge pattern – seen in the chart below.  As seen above, BTC suffered a symmetrical triangle breakdown yesterday, signaling an end of the corrective bounce and a resumption of the sell-off. So, the immediate outlook remains bearish as long as prices are holding below the lower edge of the symmetrical triangle pattern (former support), currently at $3,850. BTC, however, has also established a falling wedge –  a bullish reversal pattern. Therefore, the outlook as per the hourly chart would turn bullish if prices cross $3,882 (upper edge of the wedge). The breakout, if confirmed, would open up upside toward $4,265 (Dec. 2 high) and possibly to $4,410 (Nov. 29 high). Securing that bullish breakout, however, could prove a tough task, as the major moving averages (50-, 100- and 200-hour) are trending south in favor of the bears. Securing that bullish breakout, however, could prove a tough task, as the major moving averages (50-, 100-, and 200-hour) are trending south in favor of the bears.  Over on the daily chart, the lower high pattern, yesterday’s bearish close below $3,771 and the downward sloping 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (MAs) continue to favor a re-test of $3,474 (Nov. 25 low). Notably, BTC struggled to close above the 10-day EMA during the recent corrective bounce. So, a daily close above that EMA, if and when it occurs, could be considered an advance signal of an impending bullish move. That said, a more credible evidence of a trend reversal would be a convincing break above $4,400. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent drop to 14-month lows has left the cryptocurrency on track for its biggest ever yearly loss. Just three weeks ago, the cryptocurrency was changing hands at $6,300 – already a 54 percent year-to-date drop, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The dominant market narrative back then was that BTC would trim losses in the last few weeks of 2018, having bottomed out around $6,000 in five months to October. However, on Nov. 14, BTC nosedived below the crucial 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) support, signaling a resumption of the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached last December. As a result, prices ultimately dropped to 14-month lows below $3,500 on Nov. 25 before regaining some poise. With the bears still keeping the upper hand, a significant recovery from current levels appears unlikely before year’s end, and BTC looks set to snap its three-year winning streak with a 73 percent annual price drop – its biggest on record. if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""]={},window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].embedDeltas={""100"":655.0208339999999,""200"":548.0208339999999,""300"":522.0208339999999,""400"":495.020834,""500"":495.020834,""700"":469.020834,""800"":469.020834,""900"":469.020834,""1000"":469.020834},window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-SXOv6""),window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""SXOv6""==b)window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""}); As seen in the table above, BTC’s only previous annual loss was a 57 percent drop in 2014. This year’s loss would be the biggest on record as long as prices hold below $5,959. Meanwhile, the technical charts indicate that the cryptocurrency may extend the loss further before the year’s end.  As seen above (price data via Bitstamp), BTC has found acceptance below the crucial support of the 200-week EMA, bolstering the already bearish technical set-up represented by the descending triangle breakdown, confirmed two weeks ago. BTC has suffered a symmetrical triangle breakdown on the 4-hour chart, indicating that the recent corrective bounce ended at the Nov. 29 high of $4,400 and the bears have likely regained control. The stacking order of the 50-candle EMA, below the 100-candle EMA, below the 200-candle EMA is also a classic bear indicator. BTC, therefore, risks re-testing the recent low of $3.474 in the next few days. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin (BTC) may break its three-year December winning streak unless prices convincingly cross key resistance at $4,410 in the next few days. The leading cryptocurrency by market value gained 14 percent, 30 percent and 40 percent in the last month of 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. (BPI). The odds, however, are stacked against BTC extending that winning streak this year. To start with, BTC’s convincing break below the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) last month signaled a resumption of the bear market from the record high of $20,000 reached 12 months ago. Essentially, the bears are in control while prices are trading below the key EMA, currently located at $5,747 Further, the corrective bounce from recent lows below $3,500 ran out of steam near $4,410 last Thursday, validating the strong bearish view put forward by the break below the 21-month EMA.

As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,980 on Bitstamp, representing 1.1 percent drop from its monthly opening price of $4,024.  As seen above, the bullish divergence of the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) confirmed last Wednesday has failed to produce a notable rally, which indicates bearish sentiment is still quite strong. Moreover, BTC created a doji candle on Thursday, signaling indecision in the marketplace despite a bullish divergence, falling below $4,000 on Friday and confirming an end to the corrective bounce. Essentially, the cryptocurrency has carved out a lower high (bearish pattern) at $4,400. The 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) are also trending south, indicating a bearish setup. As a result, the cryptocurrency looks set to re-test the recent low of $3,474. However, a convincing break above $4,400 (Nov. 29 high) would revive the bullish view and allow a sustained rally to psychological resistance of $5,000.  The descending triangle breakdown (bearish continuation pattern) and the downward sloping 5- and 10-week EMAs indicate the path of least resistance is to the downside.

" Bitcoin just ended its worst-performing month in seven years in terms of month-over-month price declines.  The world’s largest cryptocurrency began November at an average price across exchanges of $6,341, but as of 0:00 UTC on December 1 is trading at just $3,964, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.  As it stands, the near $2,400 drop in bitcoin’s price has created a -37.4 percent monthly performance, which is its worst on record since August 2011, when it fell from roughly $8 to $4.80 to print a -40 percent monthly loss, according to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""NG8Fd""]={},window.datawrapper[""NG8Fd""].embedDeltas={""100"":600,""200"":550,""300"":525,""400"":525,""500"":500,""700"":500,""800"":500,""900"":500,""1000"":500},window.datawrapper[""NG8Fd""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-NG8Fd""),window.datawrapper[""NG8Fd""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""NG8Fd""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""NG8Fd""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""NG8Fd""==b)window.datawrapper[""NG8Fd""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""});
Since bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization by a considerable margin, now comprising 53.5 percent of the total market, all other cryptocurrencies tend to follow its lead when it comes to price performance.  As a result, the broader market suffered substantial losses in November, with just one of the world’s largest 25 cryptocurrencies able to post a monthly gain.  The outlier was bitcoin SV, a fork off of the original bitcoin cash blockchain, yet it has only existed long enough to accrue 22 days of pricing data on CoinMarketCap. if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""]={},window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].embedDeltas={""100"":625,""200"":575,""300"":525,""400"":500,""500"":500,""700"":500,""800"":475,""900"":475,""1000"":475},window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-SXOv6""),window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""SXOv6""==b)window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""}); Double-digits losses were common among the world’s largest cryptocurrencies in November. Tezos (XTZ) was the worst performer of the month, reflecting a 61.5 percent loss with bitcoin cash (BCH) just 3 percent behind. What’s more, the average performance of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization was -30 percent, while the average performance of all 25 was -37 percent. Since market capitalization is a function of the price of a cryptocurrency multiplied by its circulating supply, the capitalization of the total market takes a hit whenever prices experience a steep drop.  At the beginning of November, the total market capitalization recorded a value of $203 billion, yet today that figure records $130 billion, a 35 percent loss. The total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market has now lost over $690 billion and 83 percent of its value since reaching its all time high north of $820 billion this past January, according to CoinMarketCap.

" Bitcoin (BTC) tanked in November on the back of high volumes, raising the possibility that the market has, to some extent, capitulated. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $4,000 – down 36 percent from its monthly opening price of $6,318 – according to CoinMarketCap data. That drop marks the biggest monthly loss of the year so far. Amid the losses, trading volumes jumped by 33 percent month-on-month to $158.48 billion – the highest level since May. It is worth noting that, at the start of the month, BTC was already down close to 70 percent from the record high of almost $20,000 reached in December 2017. So, November’s losses essentially mark an extension of the bear market (which had supposedly bottomed out near $6,000) with a high-volume drop to 14-month lows below $3,500. But BTC’s failure to produce a meaningful bounce despite the repeated defense of the 21-month EMA in five months to October might have left investors disappointed, resulting in the increased sell-off as they left the market. Amid these signs of capitulation, it is still too early to call a long-term bottom. In the last few days, however, prices have recovered from lows below $3,500 – possibly just bargain hunting after the sell-off, but potentially the start of a corrective rally, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) was reporting record oversold conditions a few days ago.  On the monthly chart, BTC is set to close below the former support (now resistance) of the 21-month EMA for the first time since October 2015. A long-term bullish reversal would only be confirmed if and when prices clear the EMA, currently lined up at $5,977.  On the 4-hour chart, BTC has fallen back below the double top neckline support at $4,120, having faced rejection at the falling trendline. As a result, the immediate bullish outlook has been neutralized. The recent low of $3,474 could come into play if the immediate support at $3,771 (low of Wednesday’s bullish reversal candle) is breached. A break above the falling trendline, if confirmed, would bolster the already bullish technical setup and could yield a stronger rally toward $5,000.

" Bitcoin (BTC) is teasing a short-term bullish reversal, having just recorded its biggest single-day gain in seven months. Prices closed yesterday (UTC) at $4,257, a 24-hour increase of 11.43 percent and the highest daily gain since April 12, according to CoinMarketCap. Back then, the cryptocurrency was trading above $6,900, 38 percent higher than the current price of $4,345. Interestingly, the 13 percent price gain witnessed that day had been preceded by a 45 percent drop and a minor bout of consolidation. More importantly, the big bullish move of April 12 marked the beginning of the rally, which saw prices rise to near $10,000 by early May. Similarly, yesterday’s 11 percent rise had been preceded by a 44 percent drop to 14-month lows below $3,400. Further, positive signs are building up on the short duration technical charts. As a result, bitcoin could be in for a short-term bullish reversal, similar to the one witnessed after April 12.  Yesterday, BTC created a big bullish candle, validating the bearish exhaustion signaled by the previous three long-tailed candles. With the strong move higher, the 14-day relative strength has moved back into undersold territory above 30.00, confirming a bullish divergence (higher low on RSI). So, it’s possible history is about to repeat itself with a bullish move toward $5,000. Notably, the bullish case looks stronger than it did seven months ago. The RSI hit record lows during the recent sell-off, signaling extreme oversold conditions, as opposed to readings above 30 registered before April 12.  Over on the 4-hour chart, the cryptocurrency is probing the falling channel resistance of $4,320 at press time, having confirmed a double bottom breakout with a move above $4,120 earlier today. Notably, the bull flag breakout seen in the 15-minute chart is signaling that the falling channel hurdle could be breached in the next few hours. The breakout, if confirmed, would only bolster the already bullish technical setup. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Google’s trend explorer reveals the weekly number of worldwide searches for the keyword “bitcoin” has reached levels not seen since the first week in April.  While the exact number of searches accrued so far this week is not clear, data from Google reveals ‘bitcoin’ searches in the past three days alone made up 17 percent of its all-time-high weekly search volume set from Dec. 17-23, 2017.  At that time, the cryptocurrency was trading around its record high near $20,000, while at the time of writing, it is valued at $4,167 according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).   Google trend data further reveals that the most searches for bitcoin in the world over the past week came from Nigeria, South Africa and Austria, in that order. Interestingly, the U.S. barely cracked into the top-20, ranking in at 19.  The seven-month high in Google searches for bitcoin perhaps should not come as a surprise since the cryptocurrency made headlines last week for its price falling to a 13-month low below $4,000. Data further reveals the searches for bitcoin more than doubled on the day it entered the $3,000 range, Nov. 24. That said, it has long been speculated that the price of bitcoin and its Google search trends are highly correlated, which suggests the uptick may be a sign of things to come for bitcoin’s price. A study conducted in 2017 by researcher Willy Woo shows that the Google search trends can even be used to detect speculative bubbles as well as the best and worst times to buy the cryptocurrency. In other words, periods of low ‘bitcoin’ search volume have historically shown to be the points of maximum financial opportunity, whereas periods of abnormally high search volume tend to act as a warning sign that bitcoin is in a bubble and may soon experience a pullback in price.

" Bitcoin’s 15-percent recovery from the 14-month low hit yesterday may have opened the doors for short-term price consolidation. The leading cryptocurrency by market value dropped through the support of the trendline connecting the August 2015 and August 2016 lows and fell to $3,474 yesterday – the lowest level since Sept. 17, 2017 (prices as per Bitstamp). At that level, BTC was down 38 percent from the highs above $6,300 seen two weeks ago. The drop was short-lived, however, and prices closed yesterday (as per UTC) at $3,939 – well above the trendline – validating the oversold conditions reported by the technical indicators. As a result, a bout of consolidation could be in the offing. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $3,920 on Bitstamp, having clocked a high of $4,069 earlier today. The 15 percent recovery, though, may turn out to be a “dead cat bounce” if the long-term trendline support, currently at $3,830 is again breached. Meanwhile, the prospects of a stronger corrective rally would improve if prices find acceptance above $4,000.  The bullish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) and the falling channel breakout in the 4-hour chart indicate a bearish-to-bullish trend change. As a result, a stronger recovery rally toward $4,461 (downward sloping 50-candle EMA) cannot be ruled out. Gains above that level may remain elusive as the stacking order of the 50-candle EMA below the 100-candle EMA, below the 200-candle EMA indicates the path of least resistance is on the downside.  Over on the daily chart, the RSI has created a bullish divergence (higher low). That pattern would gain credence if the RSI moves above 30.00 into the undersold territory. The primary trend, however, would remain bearish as long as both the 5- and 10-day EMAs are sloping downwards.  As seen in the above chart, BTC is now trapped between the former support-turned-resistance of the 200-week EMA, currently at $4,174, and the three-year-long rising trendline support. Acceptance below the trendline support of $3,830 would invalidate the signs of revival seen in the 4-hour and daily chart.

" With bitcoin prices dropping further early on Sunday, the cryptocurrency now looks to be heading for its worst weekly loss in over 5 years. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading at $3,520 on Bitstamp, representing a 36 percent drop from Monday’s opening price of $5,553. Unless the bulls can pull off a recovery, it’s looking to be the biggest weekly drop since the second week of April 2013, when prices fell 44.8 percent from $165  to $91. For the weekly loss to be confirmed on the charts, BTC must close today (as per UTC) below $3,887, or the resulting weekly loss would be the second biggest of 2018 – the first being the 30 percent drop witnessed in the last week of January. Bitcoin’s weekly performance  The 33-percent price drop is looking overdone, as per the 14-day relative strength index (RSI). The market, however, is paying no heed to the oversold conditions reported by that technical indicator. This is evident from the fact that BTC has continued to find sellers in the last 11 days, despite the record low reading on the RSI. BTC’s inability to produce a stronger corrective bounce despite oversold conditions indicates the “buy-the-dip” mentality is largely absent.  As seen above, BTC is currently trading below $3,760 – the support of the trendline connecting the August 2015 and August 2016 lows. A close below that level would bolster the already bearish technical setup, as represented by the convincing move below the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) support and the downward sloping 5- and 10-week EMAs.

" The price of bitcoin fell below $4,000 for the first time today since September 27th of last year.  At around 16:20 UTC Saturday, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization sank to an average price across exchanges of $3,970.43, a figure 7.5 percent lower than the day’s opening price of $4,298.83, according to Coindesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.  At $3,745.89 as of press time, BTC’s price is now down more than $1,700, or 30 percent, in the past seven days alone and 81 percent from its all-time high of roughly $20,000, set back in December.   While several well-known cryptocurrencies are posting positive 24-hour price developments when valued against BTC, including the likes of XRP (XRP), ethereum (ETH) and dash (DASH) which are all up more than 2 percent in BTC terms, the broader market is still experiencing substantial losses vs. the USD.  Out of the world’s 10 largest cryptocurrencies, bitcoin cash (BCH), stellar (XLM), monero (XMR) and cardano (ADA) are the worst performers, all reporting 24-hour losses above 10 percent (vs. USD), according to data from Coinmarketcap. An effect of the plummet in cryptocurrency prices is a significant depreciation in the capitalization of the entire market. Just seven days ago, the market was valued at $182 billion, but that number has since fallen $54 billion, or 30 percent to where it now stands at $128 billion, its lowest value since September 2017.  Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin’s defense of key long-term support for the second time in four days is a positive sign for a potential recovery rally. The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell below $4,242 (low of Wednesday’s inside-day candle) in the Asian trading hours, putting the bears back into the driver’s seat. As a result, BTC fell below the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) of $4,182 earlier today. The breach of the EMA support, however, may have trapped the bears on the wrong side of the market, as BTC is currently trading at $4,330 on Bitstamp, having clocked an intraday low of $4,061 earlier today. It is worth noting that the long-term EMA was first breached on Tuesday. The subsequent sell-off, however, ended at the 14-month low of $4,048 and prices recovered to $4,500 on the following day. The repeated failure to beat the long-term support indicates the bears have likely run out of steam. As a result, a stronger corrective rally could be in the offing.  On the 4-hour chart, the relative strength index (RSI) has created a bullish divergence with higher lows. As a result, BTC looks set to test $4,635 – the neckline of the double-bottom bullish reversal pattern. A break above that, if confirmed, would open up upside toward $5,100 (target as per the measured height method).  As seen above, the 14-day relative strength index is holding below 30.00 for the ninth day straight, signaling ongoing oversold conditions. The 5- and 10-day EMAs, currently at $4,546 and $4,933, respectively, are still trending south. Therefore, corrective rallies above the 10-day EMA, if any, could face exhaustion near $5,000.

" Few projects have done as much to explore crypto micropayments as the year-old Yalls blog created by Lightning Labs developer Alex Bosworth. From April through early November, Bosworth said, blog participants have processed nearly 20,000 invoices with the Lightning Network, a bitcoin scaling solution that makes micropayments feasible by keeping them off the blockchain, sidestepping network transaction fees. It costs roughly one cent to read a Yalls article, half a cent to leave a comment on a post, and 10 cents to react to a post with an emoji. Publishing an article costs around 6 cents. “One nice thing about micropayments is that it brings back anonymity to the web,” Bosworth told CoinDesk. “I’m really a fan of the idea that your identity doesn’t have to be tied to a username and password.” Explaining that readers can tap into Yall’s Lightning node-and-channels system without a traditional subscription, like most paywalled outlets, he added: “Maybe you don’t even have a wallet yet … So you go to the Yalls app page, you can connect to it.” So far readers have opened more than 118 Lightning nodes through this platform, many of which are now facilitating payment channels, in which small amounts are sent back and forth between users before final settlement on the blockchain. This allowed contributors to post 170 new articles from July to early November 2018, while readers paid for 675 emoji reactions and 194 comments. Plus, writers have claimed their bite-sized crypto rewards at least 432 times during the same period, collecting the fees from readers for their articles. “It’s pennies, so every single invoice is small,” Bosworth said. As such, some node operators have been operating channels for several months, and according to Bosworth, earning roughly $5 a month on routing fees. While this hardly constitutes a business model for daily publishing, it highlights how engaged readership can contribute to a platform’s broader infrastructure. Speaking to how media outlets often find participatory ecosystems difficult to moderate, since trolls and marketers can flood comment sections at no cost, he added: “The micropayments help there, because then you don’t have robots or spam.” Since Bosworth created this blog as a hobby, with a corresponding Lightning node on-boarding process, he doesn’t regularly track readers or payments and provided the April-November data to CoinDesk on request. He hasn’t marketed the site or solicited contributions either. And yet, it’s clear that bitcoin fans are engaging. “In the beginning of the site there were problems keeping the node online. If the node died, you couldn’t read any articles or do anything on the site. I had to really babysit the node,” Bosworth said. “Over time, that feedback made its way back to LND [Lightning Network Daemon] and now the node is pretty stable.” On the other hand, Bosworth acknowledged it will take years for this type of community funding to work for professional media outlets. For starters, few people know how to operate a Lightning-friendly crypto wallet or node. General crypto-literacy is in short supply among mainstream audiences. Plus, syncing up wallets and nodes with the site itself takes time to develop in-house. According to Bosworth, readers were “pretty forgiving” when payments worth less than a penny had trouble processing. But “if you start to charge people like $20 a month or something, you have to provide a higher quality of service, that there’s never any bugs,” he said, adding that reliable infrastructure for one-click payments is the only way readers will use crypto micropayments for content on-the-go. “If the infrastructure were there, so that there were less mental costs on the user to make that payment,” he said, “I think it could take off.” Lightning image via Shutterstock",2018-11-23
" Bitcoin (BTC) could be in for a stronger recovery rally in the next few days, having found a temporary bottom near $4,000. The leading cryptocurrency, which hit a 14-month low of $4,048 on Bitstamp yesterday, is now trading at $4,580, representing a 2 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. The $500 recovery seen yesterday indicates that the market is finally paying heed to the record oversold levels reported by the 14-day relative strength index (RSI). Currently, the indicator is still hovering in oversold territory below 30.00. As a result, BTC is unlikely to revisit yesterday’s low of $4,048 for now. Further, the correction looks set to gather pace, as the RSI on the 3-day chart has dropped into the oversold region for the first time since January 2015.  Oversold readings on the RSI tend to put a bid under the cryptocurrency, historical charts show. For instance, BTC bottomed out at $275 in the first week of October 2014 – with the sell-off looking overdone as per the RSI – and rose to highs above $400 in the next few days. On similar lines, the oversold conditions signaled by the RSI in January 2015 likely triggered a recovery rally, pushing prices above $300 by mid-month. As of writing, the RSI is hovering well below 30.00. Therefore, the cryptocurrency looks due for a break above $5,000.  The bullish RSI divergence, seen on both the hourly and 4-hour charts, also indicates the recent sell-off has likely run out of steam near $4,000 and a relief rally could be in the offing.  On the daily, the primary trend remains bearish, as the 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) are sloping downwards. These averages, currently at $4,854 and $5,242, respectively, could cap any corrective rally. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" A total of $60 billion has been erased from the value of all cryptocurrencies over the last week, a decline that has many wondering if the ongoing bear market for the asset class has finally come to an end. Defined as a period of depressed activity and sentiment, the bear market has seen the price of bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, decline more than 75 percent from all-time highs set in January. Further, as bitcoin makes up more than 50 percent of the entire market in terms of total capitalization, it’s safe to say the bear market may end when bitcoin bulls refuse to cede more ground. But in order for a true ‘bottom’ to be found, many figure a “capitulation” needs to take place, since it is traditionally the last stage of a prolonged bear market.  By definition, capitulation is characterized by extreme panic selling backed by high volume that builds momentum until an eventual “bottom” is found. The bottom is a price level where the asset looks too cheap or undervalued to investors for them to allow it to fall any further.  It’s difficult to consider something to have officially capitulated until after it has occurred, but by looking at previous capitulation stages and market bottoms for BTC, there are a few signs traders and investors alike can watch out for that may allude to an official market bottom From 2013-2015, BTC experienced a bear market similar to the one occurring now, in which it reached an all-time high of $1,163 in November, 2013 and eventually fell 86 percent to bottom out at $152 in January, 2015.  From that day forward, the price never retreated below $152, according to data from the Bitstamp exchange. If that particular market bottom is an example of true capitulation, it’s clear there are two factors paramount to achieving capitulation: volume climaxes and rapid price declines.   As can be seen in the above chart, the sell-off for BTC began to accelerate at the beginning of 2015, but did not reach an extreme until two weeks later. On Jan. 15, fear and panic in the market reached its peak. The price of BTC dropped 30 percent in a single 4-hour candlestick that was backed by its most sell volume in several months – an extreme selling event like this creates a volume climax which tends to be the precursor to a market bottom. The sign that likely cemented this point in time as the bottom was what followed the selling climax – even more buy volume. At this point, fear in the market officially met demand and those still interested in BTC considered the $152 price tag too cheap to let it slip any further.  As can be seen below, the market is again experiencing a significant sell-off, but so far has been more gradual than the capitulation experienced in 2015.  This is evident in that no single 4-hour candlestick has recorded more than a 9 percent loss whereas the single “market bottoming” four-hour candlestick in 2015 recorded a 30 percent loss. That said, sell volume has clearly picked up pace over the last couple of days and the current four-hour chart is showing promising signs for an “at least temporary” bottom.  As can be seen in the above chart, sell volume is beginning to lessen and diverge from the falling price, a sign sell orders are drying up. What’s more, the last four-hour candle just bullishly engulfed the prior candlestick with a notable uptick in buying volume.  A candle is considered to be ‘bullish engulfing’ when its body completely covers that of the prior candle, these types of candle tend to form at the bottom of downtrends but are more powerful the higher the timeframe.  Should be noted, capitulation events do not immediately reverse the long-term trend of a market. After BTC bottomed out in Jan. 2015, it largely traveled sideways for another 10 months before beginning a new uptrend toward the end of the year. Such extreme selling events are also very rare, so it’s unlikely for the exact market conditions of 2015 to be replicated this time around. It’s safe to say though when true capitulation occurs, you’ll know. Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin’s drop to 13-month lows has likely put the cryptocurrency on the path to post its worst monthly loss of 2018. The leading cryptocurrency is currently trading at roughly $4,700 – down roughly 26 percent from the monthly opening price of $6,320 – according to CoinDesk market data. As of now, November is the second-worst month of 2018, the first being March with a 32 percent price drop. November, however, would take the top spot if prices find acceptance below $4,200, pushing the monthly loss above 32 percent.  Indeed, BTC could regain some poise in the next ten days, as the record low on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is signaling extreme oversold conditions. In that case, November may become the second-worst month of the year or may even slip lower. However, a monthly loss looks like a done deal as a rally all the way back to $6,320 is unlikely to happen in the near-term.  This is because the demand side pressures may have weakened significantly in the last few days.  Moreover, a significant majority was expecting BTC to end its prolonged period of consolidation with a bullish breakout. The cryptocurrency, however, fell below $6,000 –  a level where prices had supposedly carved out a long-term bottom – trapping many on the wrong side of the market.

" Bitcoin’s price continues to slide despite the oversold conditions signaled on the technical charts for the last six days. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell to $4,200 soon before press time – a price low not seen since Oct. 5, 2017 – and was last seen trading at $4,484, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Notably, the 14 percent drop witnessed in the last 24 hours has pushed the widely followed 14-day relative strength index (RSI) below 10.00, its lowest reading on record. An asset is considered to be oversold and due for a corrective bounce when its RSI is below 30.00. BTC’s RSI fell into oversold territory on Nov. 14, but a strong recovery rally has still not materialized. That said, a corrective bounce might be seen in the next 24 hours or so, as the low on the RSI is backed by a rise in BTC/USD longs.  As seen above, BTC has dropped 34 percent in the last five days, despite being so oversold. The cryptocurrency’s inability to produce a notable recovery rally in such conditions could be considered a sign that bearish sentiment is currently very strong. Still, the bears should exercise caution in the next 24 hours.  As seen above, long positions hit a 3.5-month high of 31,719 earlier today, having risen 34 percent in the last six days – both of which indicate that investors are buying the current dip.  A corrective bounce, if any, will likely be short-lived as both descending triangle breakdown and the break of the seven-year-long rising trendline has likely set the tone for a drop to $4,100 (trendline connecting the January 2015 and April 2017 lows.)

" Bitcoin dropped below $5,000 for the first time in over 13 months on Monday. CoinDesk price data reveals the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell to $4,981 shortly after 16:30 UTC on Monday, signifying a dollar-decline of more than $500 for the day when the move occurred. That’s the lowest figure since Oct. 12, 2017, and as of press time, the price has recovered somewhat to $5,048 – still signifying a decline of more than 9 percent.  The broader cryptocurrency market accompanied BTC in its steep sell-off and has shed more than $15 billion in total market capitalization in the last 24 hours.   Many cryptocurrencies are faring worse than BTC, including the likes of ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC) and EOS, all of which are posting 24-hour losses above 10 percent. According to data from OnChainFX, some of the biggest losses of the day include Aragon, LBRY Credits and ZClassic, all of which have seen price declines in excess of 20 percent in the past day.

" Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to its lowest level since October 2017 on Monday, amid a broader period declines for the world’s top cryptocurrencies. The leading cryptocurrency fell to $5,165 earlier today – the lowest level since Oct. 18, 2017 – having breached the crucial support of $6,000 last week. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $5,283 – down 5 percent on a 24-hour basis and 16 percent week-on-week – according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Further, the year-on-year loss now stands at 32 percent, as prices were trading well above $7,600 on Nov. 19, 2017. Elsewhere, ethereum’s ETH token, cardano and Tron are also flashing double-digit losses on a 24- hour basis. Notably, ETH fell to $155 earlier today, the lowest level since July 16, 2017, as per CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, XRP, the second-largest cryptocurrency as per market capitalization, is reporting a 6.5 percent drop. Only nine out of top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are trading in the green and three out of the nine are stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies. The sharp losses in the major cryptocurrencies have pushed the total market capitalization down to a 13-month low of $172 billion. In the last five days, the total value has dropped by more than $30 billion. The risk aversion could worsen in the near-term, as bitcoin is looking increasingly weak on the technical charts. As seen above, BTC closed last week (UTC) at $5,560, confirming a downside break of the nine-month-long descending channel – a bearish continuation pattern. The cryptocurrency also closed below the 100-week exponential moving average (EMA), which had been acting as support since June. More importantly, both 50- and 100-week EMAs have shed bullish bias. The 14-week relative strength index (RSI) of 37.00 is signaling scope for a deeper sell-off. Therefore, BTC risks falling below the psychological support $5,000 in the near term. Major support below that level is seen around $4,100 (trendline connecting the January 2015 and April 2017 lows.)  Over on the daily chart, the RSI of 15 is indicating that the sell-off is overdone. Hence, a sustained break below the psychological support of $5,000 looks unlikely in the short-term.  The RSI on the 4-hour chart is creating a higher low, despite the lower low on the price chart, marking the development of a bullish divergence. The divergence would be confirmed if the RSI continues to post higher lows and the 4-hour candle closes in the green. That would open the doors to a corrective rally.

" If past events are a guide, bitcoin (BTC) could in for a recovery rally in the short-term. Following Wednesday’s 10 percent slump, the leading cryptocurrency printed an intraday low of $5,188 on Thursday, before closing largely unchanged on the day (as per UTC) at $5,580. The price swing formed what’s termed a “long-tailed doji” candle on the daily chart, which is usually taken to represent indecision in the marketplace. The fact that the candle appeared at the bottom of the recent sell-off indicates the indecision is predominantly among the sellers and could be considered a sign of bearish exhaustion. Potentially more interesting, though, is that throughout 2018, BTC has witnessed corrective rallies in the days following the creation of long-tailed candles. As can be seen above, the cryptocurrency created a long-tailed candle on Feb. 6 and rallied to highs above $11,700 in the next two weeks. On similar lines, a long-tailed candle on April 5 was followed by a rally to highs above $9,900 soon after – a pattern that was repeated in June and August (marked by arrows). It’s worth noting that the relative strength index (RSI) was reporting oversold conditions on each occasion. Further, the low of the long-tailed candles has never been put to test on the following day. However, the resultant corrective rallies each ended up creating a lower price high.  The above chart shows: So, the stage may be set for a recovery rally to former support-turned-resistance of $5,777 (June low). A break higher would allow a test of $6,000 – a level at which BTC had supposedly carved out a long-term bottom in recent months. However, the historical pattern may not play out if prices find acceptance below the previous day’s low of $5,188. A break below that level would signal a resumption of the sell-off.

" Bitcoin is looking oversold after a drop to 13-month lows Wednesday and could defend immediate support at $5,000 in the next few days. The world’s top cryptocurrency by market value fell to $5,324 (price via Bitstamp) in a matter of hours yesterday, reaching its lowest level since Oct. 18. The average price across major exchanges, as calculated by CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index fell 10 percent – the biggest single-day drop since March 30. While BTC had supposedly carved out a long-term bottom around $6,000, the convincing break below that level indicates a resumption of the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached last December. As a result, a deeper drop looks likely, albeit after a minor bout of range-bound trading, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is signaling bearish exhaustion. Notably, the widely followed technical indicator is currently seen at 18, its lowest since September 2014. As the area below 30.00 represents oversold conditions, the bears may now take a breather before hitting the market with fresh offers. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $5,400 on Bitstamp, having clocked a high of $5,641 earlier today.  BTC closed at $5,595 yesterday, confirming a downside break of a nine-month-long descending triangle. Meanwhile, the 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) have adopted a bearish bias, while the stacking order of the 50-day EMA, below the 100-day EMA, below the 200-day EMA, indicates that the path of least resistance is to the downside.  Over on the monthly chart, BTC is trading below the support of the trendline connecting the November 2011 and August 2016 lows, validating the bearish view put forward by the bearish crossover between the 5- and 10-month EMAs in September. The RSI is now threatening to turn bearish below 50.00 for the first time since September 2015. To sum up, the odds are stacked in favor of a drop below the psychological support of $5,000, although the oversold daily RSI indicates that may not happen immediately.

" Bitcoin sank to its lowest price in over a year on Wednesday, with the prices of other major cryptocurrencies falling alongside it. As of press time, bitcoin is trading at $5,525.92 – a more than 12 percent decline on the day – in the latest sign that volatility around the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has returned with a vengeance. Indeed, bitcoin’s collective market cap dropped below the $100 billion level for the first time since November 12 of last year, according to CoinDesk’s Crypto-Economics Explorer (CEX). In the past 12-hours alone, the total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market fell from roughly $210 billion to where it stands now, $180 billion. Today’s 15 percent depreciation has led the market to its lowest value since Oct. 31 of last year, CoinMarketCap data reveals. Other major cryptocurrencies are reporting declines in excess of 10 percent on the day, including ETH, XRP and bitcoin cash – the latter of which is gearing up for a contentious hard fork on Nov. 15. Notably, market data indicates that in light of today’s market drop, XRP (as of the time of this writing) has the second-largest market capitalization for cryptocurrencies, surpassing ETH. USDT, the stablecoin known more commonly as tether, saw a notable drop in its price to a low of $0.95 on crypto exchange Kraken, which offers one of the few trading pairs of the token against the U.S. dollar. Tether, among other stablecoins, is intended to hold parity against the U.S. dollar, and data from CoinMarketCap shows that the token is trading in the $0.96-$0.97 range. Because of the dip in USDT, the BTC premium on exchanges like Bitfinex, which trades against USDT, has risen to over $300. In other words, a single unit of bitcoin can now be purchased for $5,557 on Coinbase (a regulated exchange trading against USD) while the same unit costs $5,870 USDT on Bitfinex.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) price woes may not be over just yet, as a key technical indicator is about to turn bearish for the first time in four years. On the three-day chart, the 50-candle simple moving average (SMA) looks set to cut the 200-candle SMA from above, confirming what is popularly known as the “death cross.” This specific bearish crossover was last seen in December 2014. The onset of a death cross can be a warning that a bear market is looming, according to technical theory. In reality, however, it is the result of a prolonged bear market – i.e., it’s a backward-looking indicator. As a result, the oversold market usually sees a bounce after a bearish crossover is confirmed. In this case, the crossover looks likely to occur in the next few days. The bulls, however, are cautioned against betting on a follow-up price jump immediately, as prices dropped 50 percent in the four weeks following the death cross confirmation in mid-December 2014. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,185 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.8 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  On the three-day chart, the impending death cross can be seen as the confluence of the 50-candle and 200-candle simple moving average (SMA), which have closed sharply in the last three months. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) of 41.00 is biased toward the bears and holding well above the oversold territory (below 30.00). Therefore, prices could be in for a deeper drop in the short-term, possibly to levels below the June low of $5,774. It’s worth noting that the sell-off witnessed after the death cross seen in December 2014 ended up carving a long-term bottom at $152 in January 2015. On similar lines, the impending crossover and the resulting slide in prices, if any, could turn out to be the final leg of the bear market. As for today, the cryptocurrency is looking weak, having found acceptance below the trendline connecting the Oct. 11 and Oct. 31 lows.  Over on the daily chart, the violation of the ascending trendline support is backed by the downward sloping 5- and 10-day SMAs. This backs up the view that deeper losses toward $6,000 could be in the offing in the next 24 hours. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) price dropped to two-week lows earlier today and could extend the decline to key support near $6,100, technical charts indicate. The leading cryptocurrency was teasing a bullish move 24-hours ago, having carved out a lower high of $6,270 along the support of the trendline connecting the Oct. 11 low and Oct. 31 low. The defense of the key trendline support was also backed by a bullish divergence of the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) histogram. Even so, BTC failed to pick up a bid, possibly due to sharp losses in US equities, and fell back to $6,252 in the Asian session today – the lowest level since Oct 31. BTC was last seen changing hands at $6,285 on Coinbase, representing a 0.80 percent drop on the day.  BTC has breached the ascending trendline support on the 4-hour chart, adding credence to the lower highs and lower lows pattern created from the Nov. 7 high of $6,540. The relative strength index of 32 is also biased toward the bears. So, a deeper drop could be in the offing. The bearish setup, however, would be invalidated if prices cut through the descending trendline, representing lower highs pattern.  Over on the 3-day chart, BTC looks set to test support at the trendline connecting the June 24 and Aug. 14 lows, currently at $6,113, having charted a “gravestone doj” (bearish reversal pattern) earlier this month. The bearish candlestick also marks the bulls’ failure to capitalize on the sideways breach of the triangle pattern, witnessed at the end of October.

" Bitcoin could be in for a recovery rally, having defended a key support level over the weekend. The leading cryptocurrency has been looking bearish over the last week. It suffered an ascending channel breakdown on Nov. 7, suggesting a temporary top had been created at $6,540, while the moving averages rolled over in favor of the bears a day later. As a result, BTC looked likely to drop below the support of the trendline connecting the Oct. 11 and Oct. 31 lows, and move toward $6,200 over the weekend. Instead, though, it carved out a higher low (bullish pattern) at $6,270 yesterday. More importantly, the bears failed to secure a sustained break below that rising trendline. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,360 on Coinbase, while the ascending trendline support is located at $6,300. While the rebound from the ascending trendline is encouraging, a bullish reversal would only be confirmed if prices move above $6,540 to set a higher high.  As can be seen above, BTC charted a second higher low along the rising trendline yesterday, saving the day for the bulls. BTC is also currently creating the right shoulder of an inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern. A break above the neckline resistance of $6,390, if confirmed, would pave way for a move to $6,510 (target as per the measured height method). The major exponential moving averages (EMAs) – 50, 100 and 200 – have shed bearish bias (are flatlined) too. So, a bull breakout could happen in the next few hours as the prices have bounced nicely off the trendline support.  Over on the 4-hour chart, the bullish divergence of the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) histogram is indicating that the sell-off from the last week’s high of $6,540 has likely run its course and a recovery could soon unfold. A bullish divergence is confirmed when an asset records a lower price low and the MACD records a higher low. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) reversal of the recent uptrend in prices is gathering pace and a drop into a bearish territory below $6,200 is now a possibility, technical charts indicate. The leading cryptocurrency found acceptance below the lower edge of the rising channel yesterday, invalidating the bullish price action witnessed earlier this week. Essentially, the rally from the Oct. 31 low of $6,201 has ended at a high of $6,540 reached on Nov. 7. At press time, BTC is trading at $6,350 on Coinbase, having clocked a five-day low of $6,335 soon before press time, following a sudden $100 drop. The negative follow through to yesterday’s bullish channel breakdown is an indication that the bears are likely feeling emboldened, having pulled down prices by 2.9 percent from weekly highs. As a result, the support of the trendline from Oct. 11 lows could be breached in the next few hours, opening the doors for a drop below the recent higher low of $6,200 (Oct. 31).  As can be seen above, the cryptocurrency has established a bearish lower highs and lower lows pattern, validating yesterday’s bullish channel breakdown. Further, prices seem to have found acceptance under the crucial 200-hour exponential moving average (EMA) support and the major EMAS – 50, 100 and 200 – are beginning to roll over in favor of the bears. In particular, the 50-hour looks set to cross the 100-hour EMA from above, bolstering the already bearish technical setup. The drop below the immediate support of $6,330 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement), however, is likely to happen after a minor bout of consolidation, as the relative strength index (RSI) is reporting oversold conditions below 30.00.  Over on the daily chart, the symmetrical triangle breakout and a close above the critical 50-day EMA resistance witnessed earlier this week failed to produce significant price gains. A failed breakout often ends up putting the bears back into the driver’s seat. Hence, a slide to $6,200 could be in the offing.

" Bitcoin is painting a less bullish picture than 24 hours ago, following a drop out of an ascending price channel. Stepping back, the leading cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid at $6,200 on Oct. 31, keeping the crucial 21-month EMA support intact. Further, it witnessed a symmetrical triangle breakout earlier this week, suggesting that bulls had come out victorious in a tug of war with the bears. The breakout had looked legitimate as the technical indicators turned increasingly bullish. In particular, the relative strength index rose to a three-month high of 59.00 yesterday, signaling strong bullish conditions. As a result, BTC was expected to remain well bid above $6,500 and looked likely to rise to $6,800 in the near-term. Instead, it fell back to $6,450 on Coinbase earlier today, invalidating the bullish higher lows and higher highs pattern, as seen in the chart below.  The rising channel seen in the hourly chart has been breached to the downside, meaning the recovery rally from the Oct. 31 low of $6,201 likely ended at a high of $6,540 reached yesterday. The stacking order of the 50-hour exponential moving average (EMA) above the 100-hour EMA, above the 200-hour EMA indicates the path of least resistance is still on the higher side. That bullish signal could soon weaken, though, as moving averages are lagging indicators. While the channel breakdown has opened the doors for a deeper drop to $6,372 (horizontal support line), a bearish reversal would be confirmed only if BTC drops below 6,200 (Oct. 31 low).  Over on the daily chart, BTC bears may feel emboldened if prices drop below $6,200, negating the higher low pattern. That scenario seems unlikely with bitcoin’s current lack of volatility, however. Investors should keep an eye out for a strong bounce from the ascending (bullish) 10-day EMA, as that could recharge the engines for a rally to $6,800.

" Bitcoin (BTC) looks likely to inch higher toward $6,800 in the near-term, as the technical indicators have grown increasingly bullish in the last 24 hours. Notably, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which measures the speed and change of price movements, has jumped to 59.04 – the highest level since Sept. 4. A reading above 50 indicates that bullish forces are acting on the asset. So, it seems safe to say that the leading cryptocurrency is looking its most bullish for two months. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,510 on Coinbase, representing a $100 or 1.5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. While the strong RSI is encouraging for the bulls, technical analysts may argue that calling a bullish move on the basis of that alone is somewhat risky, as the indicator occasionally produces fake signals. Even so, in this case, other BTC indicators are also biased toward the bulls, giving the RSI greater reliability.  As can be seen above, BTC has cleared the stiff 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) hurdle today, having witnessed a bullish symmetrical triangle breakout over the weekend. The 5- and 10-day EMAs are trending north, indicating a bullish setup. Further, BTC is trading above the upper Bollinger band of $6,500 at press time, and a breakout would be confirmed if prices see a UTC close today above that level. What’s more, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is rising, indicating scope for further gains. To sum up, both price action and the technical indicators are validating the bullish signals given by the RSI. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" The contentious nature of the ecosystem around cryptocurrencies is partly what gives them value – academics call it “belief heterogenity.” But discord and personal sentiment alone isn’t enough to keep prices above zero, according to research from Wang Chun Wei, Ph.D., a finance lecturer at the University of Queensland in Australia. According to Wei, if it was easier to bet against cryptocurrency prices through short positions – when someone borrows, then sells an asset with the expectation of buying it back at a lower price in an effort to make a profit on the difference  –  more of those assets would go to zero. “Daily volatility of bitcoin is around four percent. This is too high to be simply based on informational changes in fundamental value,” Wei, who previously studied whether Tether’s controversial stablecoin, USDT, could be used to prop up the price of bitcoin, told CoinDesk. As such, to investigate a better explanation for this observation, Wei looked at coins that most people would agree should be worth zero: cryptocurrencies believed to be either jokes or scams. His latest investigation into crypto values, first published in October, confirmed a longstanding theory of finance – something called the resale option hypothesis – at least partly explains why cryptocurrencies are valued the way they are today. The resale option hypothesis, which originated in 2003 from Princeton researchers Jose Scheinkman and Wei Xiong, argues that an asset tends to favor the most optimistic participants in a market (those with long bets) when two conditions persist: lots of disagreement about price and impediments to shorting the asset. “Both conditions exist in the crypto market,” Wei said. Without easy ways for people to short then, the market favors the long position. Wei told CoinDesk: “The hope that you can sell it to someone for more than what you paid for is an important factor driving cryptocurrency prices.” While Wei conducted his study on altcoins – particularly those with shady reputations – he reasoned that what he found should also explain some of the strangeness behind bitcoin’s price movements. For much of its history, the exact reasons for bitcoin’s price moves haven’t been readily apparent – these fundamentals mysterious even to the most devout maximalist. Wei studied three baskets of cryptocurrencies: mainstream coins, alleged scams and outright jokes. The mainstream basket included seven cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and XRP. The list of less-than-savory coins included the Ponzi scheme-tied Bitconnect, Urocoin (originally pitched as a coin for farmers) and ParagonCoin (a cannabis industry everything-coin). The joke-coin list featured dogecoin, RonPaulCoin and Useless Ethereum Token (UET) – the latter which wasn’t a true “scam” because its creator was forthright about his intention to take investor funds and run. According to Wei, differences of opinion help illuminate why joke coins tend to hold on to their price a bit longer than cryptocurrencies identified as fraudulent. While fraudulent tokens might hold onto their value even as suspicions mount, that eventually changes as the hustle is definitively revealed. “Once it becomes crystal clear that there’s no fundamental value, then you lose belief dispersion and the resale option value plummets,” Wei wrote in the paper. But if a coin was made in jest – without maliciousness – who’s to say it couldn’t be viewed as valuable regardless? he reasoned. So, how can this price effect be seen for the cryptocurrencies with bigger market capitalizations and wider network effects? Resale option value is, in itself, difficult to pin down. “There’s no precise way of calculating resale option value,” Wei wrote. In his paper, he tested “the statistical significance of the interactions between turnover, traded price and realized volatility” to infer a value. And based on that analysis, the hypothesis does apply to more mainstream coins. “We find mainstream cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, ethereum and [XRP], test positive to the resale option test,” Weid said. “This suggests that the price-volume relationship for mainstream cryptocurrencies exhibit speculative behavior, and thus it is unlikely that traded price for these cryptocurrencies reflect only fundamental value.” Indeed, according to Wei, the market got something of a real-world test of this idea recently as bitcoin futures began to trade on major markets starting at the end of last year. Wei told CoinDesk: “Theoretically, the introduction of shorting instruments should reduce the resale option value, and consequently reduce bitcoin price (the latter which we can see clearly).” Shorting options will soon expand for other cryptocurrencies as well. For example, Dydx is offering tokens for shorting, and crypto startup Compound has created a borrowing market that can be used for shorting coins. If Wei’s analysis proves accurate, that could increase pressure on more of the tokens that have been able to maintain higher prices. As Wei wrote in the paper, “Overall, we provide ample empirical evidence in support of anecdotal claims that cryptocurrency prices are supported by the hope of selling it to somebody else at a higher price.” Charts via Shutterstock",2018-11-07
" The bearish sentiment around bitcoin sank to three-month lows earlier today as short positions placed on crypto exchange Bitfinex fell to their lowest level since August 5th. At approximately 11:00 UTC, the number of short positions dropped to 21,434, which represents a 33 percent drop in the past eight days alone. During the same time, longs – or positions that are betting on an increase in bitcoin’s price – also witnessed a notable increase of 10 percent, the current number of which (24,410) marks a three-week high.  Indeed, the sentiment here seems to be shifting in favor of the bulls. The price of bitcoin broke bearish from a historically tight, two-week range of just $139 on Oct. 29, yet sellers were not able to further capitalize on the bearish outcome.  As a result, the price of bitcoin has risen roughly 4 percent since then to return to the range and negate the technically bearish view in the short term.  What’s more, bitcoin bulls have market seasonality on their side. The fourth quarter of the fiscal year is traditionally bullish for bitcoin prices, specifically the month of November. Data reveals that bitcoin has only concluded November with a monthly percent loss once since 2010, in 2011.  Looking at the chart below, it’s perhaps no coincidence that shorts began their more-than-30 percent drop just a day before November began. BTC/USD Longs, Shorts, and Price  When a short or long trade becomes overcrowded, it tends to represent overbought or oversold market conditions. For example, a short squeeze, or rapid price increase occurs when an abundance of shorts are forced to cover in order to avoid a losing trading.  The same can occur for longs, too. If there are an abundance of longs and price begins to fall, those longing will likely need to close their trade and as result drive the price of the underlying asset lower and faster.  Although BTC shorts have taken a hit as of late, an abundance of longs has yet to pile up. Data shows only 53 percent of the leverage positions on Bitfinex are longs, meaning 47 percent are shorts.  The relatively even ratio shows longs are not yet an overwhelming favorite, but it’s worth keeping in mind that the higher the percentage of longs, the more likely the price of bitcoin is to experience a pullback in the near term due to the overbought market conditions it would create, as was witnessed at the beginning of September.

" That bitcoin (BTC) has likely found a bottom around $6,000 is now generally accepted, so the challenge for investors and traders is to spot the early signs of a long-awaited bullish reversal. Basic technical theory suggests that a bearish-to-bullish trend change is confirmed after the price invalidates a “lower highs” pattern – a series of descending peaks. As such, bitcoin needs to rise above the September high of $7,400 to confirm a major bullish breakout. That would mean the number one cryptocurrency by market cap needs to rally close to 16 percent from the current price of $6,400 before the bulls can claim victory over the bears. Seasoned traders, however, are always on the lookout for patterns that might allow them to front-run an impending textbook bullish reversal. In bitcoin’s case, the 3-day chart – on which each candlestick represents price action over a 72-hour period – is signaling that the prospects of bullish reversal would rise sharply if prices can clear the former support-turned-resistance of the 50-candle simple moving average (SMA). As of writing, BTC is trading at $6,420 on Coinbase, representing a 0.5 percent drop in a 24-hour basis.  The 50-candle SMA marked on the chart served as a strong support, or buying level, during the entire rally from October 2015 to December 2017. The SMA support became resistance in February after prices had dropped, and stayed in that role over the months since. Notably, the recent lower price high of $7,400 was created at the SMA hurdle, so a break above that resistance could be considered an early sign of bullish reversal. It’s worth noting that BTC’s bullish break above the 50-candle SMA in July ended up trapping the bulls on the wrong side of the market. Even so, the failed breakout was likely a result of the investor disappointment following the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s rejection of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) at the time. Looking ahead, BTC is unlikely to trap the bulls this time round, as the majority of bad news has been priced in. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative. The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers. Rekt? You should see the other guy. For anyone concerned about bitcoin losing another 4 percent in October to post its third straight monthly loss, it’s worth comparing that loss to those seen by traditional financial markets. By standard measures, last month was the worst on Wall Street since the 2008 financial crisis. The Nasdaq lost 9.2 percent, the Dow Jones Industrials, 6.9 percent, and the S&P 500, 5.1 percent. Riskier markets such as tech stocks and emerging markets were hit especially hard. A 4 percent decline is still hefty. But given its past volatility, the lead cryptocurrency’s relative stability amid the angst on the Street is notable. The general impression produced by last year’s wild crypto bubble was that bitcoin and all other such tokens exist at the extreme end of the speculative class of assets. So, if world markets become risk-averse, as they did severely last month, the thinking was that people would dump bitcoin along with every other high-risk asset in their flight to dollars. Instead, up until Monday, October 30, when bitcoin suffered a $200 drop, it was more or less stable. By crypto standards, it was a boring month. It might be tempting to conclude that bitcoin is attracting a safe-haven bid, that people are looking to hedge their risks with a stable-yet-liquid asset that’s immune from the politics of financial crises. The idea is that bitcoin is starting to assert itself as a new type of uncorrelated reserve asset, a digital gold for the digital age. But the truth is there is very little of this safe-haven buying going on in bitcoin prices right now. There was no noticeable spike in transactions last month, just more of the very, very gradual increase that has occurred off the low base reached during the post-bubble period of the late winter. While there are surely some newcomers shifting their assets into bitcoin, especially in places like Venezuela, there’s no great wave of people suddenly realizing that this new digital asset might be a hedge against future political and economic turmoil. So why did this notoriously volatile asset have a relatively quiet October? One way to think about it is to reflect on the changing nature of the bitcoin investment community, which can be divided into speculators and buy-and-holders – better known as hodlers. The speculators who dominated the community last year have gone – certainly the newcomers who drove the bitcoin price to its ridiculous peak above $19,000 in December. You know the type: your mother, your cousin or that high school friend you hadn’t spoken to for years who asked for tips on what coins to buy. That leaves the hodlers, the true believers, those in it for the long term. These people are far less likely to care about turmoil in world markets putting their dollar-based wealth at risk. Many don’t even measure their risk exposure in dollar terms. They don’t – at least to a point. You see, here’s the thing: This remaining community of hodlers may soon be the guinea pigs in a much more important bitcoin stress test. What happens if, as a number of market prognosticators believe, things get truly nasty economically? I mean 2008-like nasty, when a financial crisis morphed into a full-blown economic crisis. Will these diehards resist liquidating their bitcoin assets then? The answer may be a function of their real-world economic profiles. Do most of them comprise developers and entrepreneurs paid in bitcoin and ether whose expenditures are also largely for goods and services remunerated in the same? If they can subsist in the crypto economy, then maybe they’ll keep hodling. If they do hang on, they’ll give bitcoin an impressive show of stability. Amid economic chaos, such resilience would look quite impressive to the outside world, potentially drawing another round of newcomers into the mix – not speculative “too the moon” lambo-hunters but people who get the idea that this is a valuable hedging asset for the digital economy. The number of people who live in that crypto-dominant economy is bigger than is recognized by crypto critics, who tend to see every action of this community through the lens of investors marking their profits and losses to market in dollar terms. Still, it’s difficult to say whether this group is big enough to offset the many others for whom a serious 2008-like blow to their fiat incomes will drive them to liquidate bitcoin along with other assets. Complicating matters is the fact that a host of new exchanges, custodial services and trading platforms are coming that could attract large institutions into this market. There might be a sizable amount of Wall Street money coming into bitcoin over the coming year. Bitcoin speculators hoping to turn their holdings into dollar-based fortunes tend to see this as a positive prospect, assuming the influx of funds will drive up the price. But while that might happen in the short term, the experience of last year, when short-selling accompanied the introduction of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s and Chicago Board Options Exchange’s cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts, is that these professional solutions can also invite volatility. These new institutional tools give the big guys greater capacity to get in, but they also give them the means to get out. Hedge funds are definitely not interested in hodling for holding’s sake. This stability may not last, in other words. It’s another matter whether that provides the kind of stress test that bitcoin needs to prove itself as a reserve asset.

" Bitcoin could be about to make a move towards $6,800, having witnessed a bullish breakout yesterday. The leading cryptocurrency, which had been in a narrowing price range, moved upwards to close at $6,423 yesterday, confirming an upside breakout of the symmetrical triangle pattern. With the move, the bulls look to have come out victorious in a months-long tug-of-war with the bears. However, BTC is struggling to find acceptance above the immediate resistance of the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $6,450. The EMA hurdle might be crossed in a day or two, though, as the ethereum-bitcoin exchange rate (ETH/BTC) is looking north, marking rising demand for alternative cryptocurrencies. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,400 on Coinbase, having clocked a high of $6,440 earlier today. The cryptocurrency is up 1 percent on a 24-hour basis and is largely unchanged week-on-week.  The symmetrical triangle breakout seen in the above chart indicates scope for a re-test of recent highs above $6,800. That target looks achievable as the breakout is backed by a bullish crossover on the moving average convergence divergence (MACD). Further, the relative strength index is holding in bullish territory just above 50.00.  The falling channel breakout and a convincing move above the former support-turned-resistance of 0.031994 (Sept. 25 low) indicates a bearish-to-bullish trend change. The rising MACD histogram is suggesting that further gains could be in the offing. The RSI of 53.00 is biased toward the bulls. Thus, ETH/BTC looks set to rise in the near future.

" With the number of strong support levels increasing for bitcoin (BTC), the bitcoin bears are facing an uphill battle. The latest addition to the list is the support of the trendline connecting the November 2011 and August 2016 lows, currently at $5,830. Up to Oct. 31, the two key support levels were the 21-month EMA and the trendline drawn between the June and August lows. In particular, the 21-month EMA was the level to beat for the bears till last month, meaning a close below that support would likely have revived the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 seen last December. While the 21-month EMA still remains a crucial support, the new make-or-break level is the seven-year-long rising trendline. That’s because the trendline support, which was located around $5,300 last month, has now moved closer to the current price and is seen rising above $6,300 in December. Hence, it may now be incorrect to call a break below the 21-month EMA a sign of a bear revival. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,330 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.5 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  On the monthly chart, a break below the trendline support of $5,830 would strengthen the bear grip and allow a drop to the psychological support of $5,000. The bulls, however, would feel emboldened if the cryptocurrency produces a strong bounce off that key support. As for the next 24 hours, investors should keep an eye on the symmetrical triangle seen in the chart below.  The upper edge of the symmetrical triangle, currently at $6,400, is proving a tough nut to crack on the daily chart. A break above that level would put the bulls in a commanding position, opening the doors for a rally to $6,756 (Oct. 15 high).

" After nearly two weeks stagnating at around $6,400, bitcoin (BTC) has finally made a move – to the downside. At 12:00 UTC, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dropped nearly $200 to reach a two-week low of $6,243. For the last 14-days, bitcoin had been stuck in a range of $6,590-$6,403 – its least volatile stretch since April 2017, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The squeeze in bitcoin prices had been somewhat surprising, since the cryptocurrency has shown to be correlated with the equities markets which are about to end their worst month since the financial crisis in 2008. As a result, BTC’s move to the downside was perhaps overdue. The broader cryptocurrency market has also taken a hit over the last few hours, a common occurrence when bitcoin prices show weakness. Major cryptocurrencies including ether (ETH), XRP and bitcoin cash (BCH) are all reporting 24-hour losses above three percent. Litecoin (LTC) is the worst performing cryptocurrency out of top 10 by market cap, reporting a 24-hour loss of over five percent. Further, the press time total market value of all cryptocurrencies is down just over three percent on a 24-hour basis, currently being worth $203 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. While the lengthy period of consolidation has ended in a downward move, there are still several support levels that may help keep the bears at bay. BTC/USD Daily chart  On the daily chart (prices as per Coinbase), bitcoin’s price is currently testing two technical obstacles: the symmetrical triangle resistance (white dashed line) and the prior consolidation zone near $6,200 (blue zone). Following a breakout, price tends to return to the trendline and test for support – a “backtest” in technical analysis. With bitcoin back at $6,300 (BPI) at time of writing this update, that looks to be the current scenario. A bounce off of the trendline would be considered bullish whereas retreating inside the triangle would embolden the bears. The consolidation zone that shored up the price for five days before a $700 dollar rally to the monthly high of $6,810 on Oct. 15th may once again look to offer short-term support. If it fails, there’s another chance for support just below in the form of the four-month long ascending trendline (rising white line).

" The Intercontinental Exchange’s upcoming cryptocurrency trading platform Bakkt will officially launch on December 12, pending regulatory approval. ICE announced Monday that Bakkt could begin offering physically settled bitcoin futures contracts in December, marking the first cryptocurrency-related offering provided through the new platform. Bakkt will hold the bitcoins backing the futures contract in the ICE Digital Asset Warehouse, according to the notice, provided the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) signs off. These futures contracts will be cleared through ICE Clear US, another subsidiary of the exchange, which notably owns the New York Stock Exchange. “Each futures contract calls for delivery of one bitcoin held in the Bakkt Digital Asset Warehouse, and will trade in U.S. dollar terms. One daily contract will be listed for trading each Exchange Business Day,” the announcement read. Bakkt was first announced earlier this year, when ICE announced its intention to develop “an open and regulated, global ecosystem for digital assets.” At the time, the exchange also noted it would offer a one-day bitcoin futures contract, meaning clients can cash their futures products out to receive bitcoin, rather than cash. The exchange was initially expected to launch in November, pending approval by the CFTC. No reason was immediately given for the delay through December. Bitcoin image via Shutterstock",2018-10-22
" Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has enjoyed a staggering price increase in excess of 150,000 percent since it was first listed on exchanges back in July 2010. Since then, the cryptocurrency has also experienced multiple bull runs, bear runs (the longest of which consumed much of 2014 and 2015) and stronger media attention year on year.  From a technical perspective, the relationship BTC has with traditional charting patterns is occasionally counter-intuitive to what one would normally expect.  Take, for example, the descending triangle which is typically bearish in nature. While it does contain the prospect for breaking either way, the repeated failed (bearish) descending triangle breakdowns over the course of bitcoin’s life cycle, leaves an unanswered question, are we viewing these patterns the wrong way? And if so what makes this year different?  Bitcoin’s relationship with the 200-day moving average (DMA) and descending triangle pattern has been significant. Descending triangles are measured by connecting a series of lower highs, usually angled at 45 degrees and breaking down left to right thus creating a primary trendline. The secondary baseline connects two or more of the lowest lows in a series to form the horizontal ‘floor’.  What you end up with is a descending triangle pattern that demonstrates a gradual loss of confidence in the asset you are looking at. When the patterns and indicators are combined on bitcoin’s weekly chart they show a consistent counter-play to their traditional bearish norms. As can be seen, price generally breaks bullish from the formation instead of continuing to lower supports as it normally should. The only other time bitcoin broke down from the descending triangle was back in March 2014. Post-breakdown, the bulls managed a short-term rally before being rejected by the 200-DMA, which held price under for 1.2 years. It’s clear that the price of bitcoin being under the 200 DMA firmly establishes the market as bearish, and this time around is no exception. That said, history would suggest an upside break of the current descending triangle may be on the cards soon, and that could initiate a move above the DMA as a sign of a larger trend reversal.  While it does offer insights into the relationship bitcoin has with the 200-DMA, it is key to remember that the patterns also vary in scope and size, which is usually telling of the price action that follows. So, based off the previous 1.2 year bear run, it’s possible bitcoin could turn bullish by early next year, especially if all fundamentals are taken into account, as suggested by CNBC cryptotrader, Ran Nuener. On the flipside, bitcoin has been staring down a bear market for the last 7 months and has dropped below the significant 200-DMA beginning Feb. 5. Traditional patterns such as descending triangles are still worth viewing in bearish terms since the onset rush from 2017/18 was unprecedented and the subsequent sell-off that followed has seen bitcoin drop 67 percent to date from its all-time-high in December 2017.  As stated earlier, price falling below the 200 DMA has proven to be a sign the market has officially turned bearish.  A bearish trend combined with a bearish price pattern, the descending triangle, creates an ideal technical set up for further depreciation even though bitcoin tends to negate the bear view.  If price does break down as it technically should, there is a prior resistance and support zone in the $4,900 to $5,400 that may once again offer support to the falling price.  If price breaks up as it historically should, the nearby lower highs need to be surpassed on the higher time frames in order to prove a bearish to bullish trend change is in order. The first lower high that price needs to find acceptance above is near $6,850 (differs among exchanges dealing in USDT), while the next is closer to $7,400.

" Volatile price swings and plummeting valuations have been a reality for bitcoin investors of late, but those who own traditional equities haven’t been immune either. In fact, bitcoin and the S&P have correlated on and off for almost a year, each taking turns as the leading indicator. Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency advertised as digital gold due to its difficult means of production and limited supply, is expected by some to act as a “safe haven asset,” one that rises or remains stable in times of economic turmoil (just as its metal companion traditionally has).  To date, though, rarely has that been the case.  Since Oct. 10, both bitcoin and equities markets have taken a notable plunge, and interestingly enough, to around the same degree. The S&P 500, the benchmark for equities worldwide, at its lowest point of the day of $2,710 market a 5.69 percent loss from the opening price of the day prior.  Similarly, bitcoin’s low yesterday of $6,205 marks a similar 6.7 percent depreciation from the opening prices two days ago, according to data from Binance.  The respective performances suggest bitcoin is behaving like a risk asset rather than a safe haven alternative – a claim backed up by their technical charts.  The daily chart comparison between the S&P 500 Index (SPX) and BTC shows a similar correlation in price action and direction, with a notable dip in both markets in September and October.  It has often been the case that as bitcoin gains in value, so too does the SPX, and vice versa, providing an indication on the status of investor sentiment worldwide. Observing the end of September for bitcoin, we see how prices peaked and sharply fell as the month of October rolled around, the SPX also retraced around the same time.  The first indications for bitcoin’s most recent breakdown appeared on the SPX on Oct. 4-5, demonstrated by the peak in price and a bearish 3-candlestick breakdown that triggered a sharp sell-off. Bitcoin followed suit a day later after printing a similar bearish candlestick on both charts. So, for now, it seems as though the SPX is providing signals for the bitcoin market a day or so in advance.  Risky assets are the ones that have a significant degree of price volatility and do not offer fixed returns. Further, the prices of these assets tend to rise when the domestic and global economy is growing.  For instance, stock markets do not offer a guaranteed return and usually rally when the economy is doing well and vice versa. On similar lines, emerging market currencies, base metals and oil are risky assets, which closely follow the action in the major stock exchanges across the globe. BTC does share some of the properties of the risky assets. For instance, there are no fixed returns in the bitcoin market and historically, it’s been highly volatile. More importantly, it is closely following the stock markets. So, it is safe to conclude that BTC is currently being treated as risk assets by some investors. The leading cryptocurrency will likely start behaving like a classic safe haven asset after its adoption rates have increased significantly.

" The prospect of a deeper drop in bitcoin prices has increased, price-volume analysis indicates. The world’s most valuable cryptocurrency, which had been trading sideways since September 22, fell sharply to a three-week low of $6,220 on Bitfinex yesterday, confirming a range breakdown. The technical indicators on the daily chart also turned bearish, validating a negative moving average crossover on the long duration charts. Essentially, bears regained control 24 hours ago, opening the doors to the key support of $6,000. Furthermore, the bearish case is now looking stronger than it did 24 hours ago due to these three factors:  As seen in the chart above, BTC witnessed a Bollinger band breakdown yesterday and also penetrated the support of the trendline drawn between the June 24 low and Aug. 11 low. This will likely embolden the bears, as the trendline had repeatedly put the brakes on any sell-off in the first half of September. Further, the trendline is now acting as a stiff resistance to the bulls.  Trading volumes on Bitfinex jumped to five-week highs yesterday. More importantly, total trading volume across all cryptocurrency exchanges rose 36 percent to $5.18 billion – the highest level since Sept. 21 – according to CoinMarketCap. The fact that trading volumes have grown places greater significance on the bearish move, as a high-volume drop is always considered a strongly negative indicator.  The high-volume drop was accompanied by a 10-percent drop in BTC/USD long positions and a 7.4 percent rise in BTC/USD short positions on Bitfinex. A break below key support, when accompanied by an unwinding of long positions and a rise in short positions, indicates scope for a deeper sell-off. So, it seems safe to say that the path of least resistance is to the downside. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,312, representing a 0.9 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. The slight recovery from three-week lows seen overnight is likely associated with the oversold conditions seen on the relative strength index (RSI) on the hourly and 4-hour charts.

" Bitcoin’s drop to three-week lows today has likely kick-started a bearish move towards the major support at $6,000, technical charts indicate. The leading cryptocurrency fell to $6,252 at 7:15 UTC on Bitfinex – the lowest level since Sept. 19 – and was last seen trading at $6,300, representing a 5-percent drop on a 24-hour basis. The failure to capitalize on Monday’s move above the crucial 10-week exponential moving average (EMA) resistance of $6,998, despite the upside break of a key falling trendline, ended up emboldening the bears, as expected. More importantly, the sell-off witnessed in the last few hours has put an end to a prolonged period of lateral trading. The technical indicators have rolled over in favor of the bears, adding credence to the bearish setup on the long duration charts. Further, the big drop in the equity markets this morning may not bode well for BTC, as the cryptocurrency is still being treated as a risk asset. As a result, the cryptocurrency is eyeing a drop toward $6,000. Here are four reasons why that is looking likely:  The Bollinger bands (standard deviation of +2, -2 on the 20-day moving average) on the daily chart have been moving in a sideways manner since Sept. 22, signaling a lack of clear directional bias. As a result, bitcoin price volatility, as represented by Bollinger bandwidth and the gap between weekly high and low, fell to 21-month lows and 15-month lows, respectively, last week. A prolonged period of low volatility usually makes way for a big move in either direction. In BTC’s case, that move looks to have already started to the downside, with a breach of the lower band, and may move further towards $6,000.  The relative strength index (RSI) has breached the rising trendline and fell into the bearish territory below 50.00. Notably, it is pointing lower and is well short of the oversold region (below 30.00), meaning there is enough room for a sell-off to $6,000. Meanwhile, the choppiness index has dropped below the 61.8 level and is pointing south, indicating that bearish move is gathering strength. Further, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) has produced a bearish crossover.  The bearish view put forward by the negative crossover between the 5-month and 10-month EMAs has gained more credence, courtesy of BTC’s failed breakout and a drop to three-week lows. Notably, the moving averages turned bearish last month for the first time since September 2014.  BTC’s drop to lows below $6,300 comes a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) shed 800 points. This isn’t the first time that the leading cryptocurrency has followed the action in the equity markets. As seen in the chart above, BTC pretty much mimicked the DJIA in the last quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. Looking ahead, the equities could drop further, courtesy of the rising bond yields, and push BTC lower. While many argue that BTC is a safe haven asset, the historical price action suggests that it in fact tracks equity markets. This is hardly surprising as BTC is still struggling to get mainstream exposure and investors may feel more secure with other classic safe-haven assets like gold (currently at $1,200 per Oz), which is also struggling to post gains.

" Bitcoin is having a tough time scaling a key moving average hurdle that has kept the bulls in check for four weeks straight. The obstacle that is proving so hard to beat is the 10-week exponential moving average (EMA), which stalled a rally attempt from around $6,100 in mid-September. Since then, BTC has notably failed to produce a weekly close (Sunday’s close as per UTC) above the EMA, establishing it as a crucial level to beat for the bulls. At press time, BTC is trading at $6,580 on Bitfinex, having clocked a weekly high of $6,730 on Monday. The 10-week EMA, meanwhile, is flatlined at $6,698. The retreat in the last three days indicates that BTC has failed yet again to leap the EMA hurdle, weakening the odds of further gains toward $7,000.  As seen in the chart above, the 10-week EMA has been firmly capping bitcoin prices for a month. On Monday, BTC crossed the trendline sloping downwards from July highs, confirming a bullish breakout. While one would have expected the price to now be well above the 10-week EMA hurdle, the EMA hurdle is, in fact, still intact. The rejection at the 10-week EMA despite the upside break on Monday may now embolden the bears. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin saw a low-volume bullish breakout Monday, but the long-awaited move is sending mixed signals to investors The leading cryptocurrency cleared the trendline sloping downwards from the July 25 high and Sept. 5 high around midday yesterday, adding credence to the argument put forward by many, including billionaire investor Novogratz, that the market has carved out a long-term bottom around $6,000. However, so far, the bullish trend change hasn’t significantly revved up investor interest. This is evident from the fact that the total trading volume rose by a meager 15 percent yesterday, according to CoinMarketCap. More importantly, 24-hour trading volume is holding below $4 billion (near the yearly low so far). Further, the follow-through has not been impressive either. By now, one would have expected BTC to be trading above last week’s high of $6,741. After all, the breakout occurred after a prolonged period of low volatility action. Instead, it is trading at $6,650 at press time and is holding just above the trendline support (former resistance) of $6,630 Hence, there is merit in being cautious, despite BTC’s move above the falling trendline.  As seen in the daily chart, BTC closed above the 2.5-month long falling trendline yesterday, signaling a bullish reversal. However, the lackluster response to the upside break likely indicates that investors need a more credible evidence of a bullish breakout. The cryptocurrency is likely to adopt a stronger bullish bias if it can cross the next key hurdle at $6,775 (upper Bollinger band) on the back of strong volumes.  As can be seen, BTC has been struggling to find acceptance above the 10-day exponential moving average (EMA) since mid-September. Therefore, BTC’s upside break of the trendline, as seen in the daily chart, would look more convincing once the 10-day EMA is scaled.

" Bitcoin price volatility continues to drop, with one measure having reached a 15-month low. Weekly volatility, as calculated by the difference between the high and low, fell to $317 last week – the lowest reading since the first week of July 2017 – according to Bitfinex data. More importantly, the leading cryptocurrency witnessed a trading range of $498 and $741 in the previous two weeks, respectively. The data indicate that BTC is being squeezed in an ever-narrowing price range and, as per technical rules, a decisive move is overdue. Other measures of bitcoin price volatility are also echoing similar sentiments. For instance, Bollinger bandwidth reading fell to the lowest level since December 2016 last week. The lifeless trading pattern suggests both bulls and the bears continue to remain on the sidelines, offering very little directional bias to the cryptocurrency. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,600 on Bitfinex, representing just 0.15 percent gain on a 24-hour basis and a 0.40 percent rise on a weekly basis.  BTC defended $6,100 and created a bullish outside reversal in the third week of September, as seen in the weekly chart. However, the follow-through has been anything but encouraging. Notably, the cryptocurrency created a doji candle last week, signaling indecision in the marketplace. The odds of a big bullish move would rise if BTC finds acceptance above the last week’s high of $6,741. On the other hand, a move below the last week’s low of $6,424 may embolden the bears.  Over on the daily chart, the lateral trading has brought BTC closer to falling trendline sloping downwards from July highs. The bearish trendline would be breached if BTC continues to move sideways in the next 48 hours, however, the sideways breach of the falling trendline does not qualify as a breakout, as per technical analysis theory. Only a convincing upside move above the trendline hurdle would confirm a bullish breakout. The daily chart also shows that the choppiness index has dropped below the 61.8 percent level, indicating BTC could be in the early stages of a big bullish or bearish move.

" With bitcoin (BTC) stuck in a narrow trading range for the 13th day in a row, the bulls need to force a move above $6,800 to confirm a breakout, according to the technical charts. BTC has been restricted to a narrow range of $6,800 to $6,500 since Sept. 22 and this lack of clear directional bias has pushed the volatility reading to a 21-month low. The daily volatility as represented by the Bollinger bandwidth – a technical analysis tool derived by dividing the gap between the Bollinger bands by price’s moving average – has dropped to 0.078, its lowest level since December 2016. A prolonged period of low volatility often paves way for a big move in either direction. So, it seems safe to say that BTC could soon witness a bullish or bearish breakout (though we have been saying this for a while now, and the big move is still to come). At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,600, representing a 1.65 percent gain on the day.  The Bollinger bands (standard deviation of +2, -2 on the 20-day moving average) are moving in a sideways manner, indicating there is no clear trend in the bitcoin market. For a bull breakout, BTC’s price needs to find acceptance above the upper Bollinger band of $6,800. On the other hand, a move below the lower band at $6,290 would see the bears take charge. Right now, the prospects of a downside break appear highest, as the cryptocurrency is again struggling to clear the 50-day exponential moving average (MA), currently located at $6,640.

" Bitcoin bears have been emboldened by repeated rejection from a key moving average hurdle, but they may take a breather over the next 24 hours as the price heads for another key trend line of support.  The world’s premier cryptocurrency is lacking a strong bullish or bearish bias in the near-term given that its price action has largely traded sideways since the beginning of September. That said, the repeated failure to find sustained acceptance above the 50-day moving average and $6,850 resistance gives the upper hand to bears, as it indicates that the path of least resistance is still to the downside.  Bulls might be ready to fight back, however, after bouncing off of a month-long ascending support trend line that has allowed prices to form a series of higher-lows.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,506 on Bitfinex, after having bounced off of the support trend line at $6,424 earlier today. Daily chart  As seen above in the daily chart, any bullish momentum for BTC has been halted by the 50-day moving average and $6,850 resistance zone. It’s worth noting the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is also nearing a bearish cross which may hint at more downside action to come.  However, the bearish MACD cross has yet to be confirmed. On top of that, bulls may be able to put up a fight by finding support on the ascending trend line that has been in effect since Sept 8th. Bitcoin’s price has been able to form a higher low on the trend line three times in the past, so making a fourth is not out of the question.  Also of note: the compressing relative strength index (RSI) and narrowest Bollinger Band width since Dec. 2016 suggest price is overdue for volatility.  4-hour chart  Having failed to find acceptance above the 200 EMA on the 4-hour chart, again, confirms the path to the upside remains filled with obstacles. That said, it is evident that bears have not yet gained full control since a near oversold 4-hr RSI – when combined with the ascending support – has allowed the price to form a series of higher lows.  Currently, in a stalemate, bears will look to extend losses to the previous higher low of $6,328 if price finds acceptance below the rising support.

" Bitcoin’s price looks vulnerable to modest slippage in the next 24 hours, as its persistent failure to pass a key moving average hurdle could embolden the bears. The leading cryptocurrency has been in a narrow sideways drift in recent days, with the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) proving a tough nut to crack since Saturday. BTC’s inability to cross the 50-day hurdle indicates that the bullish move from the Sept. 19 low of $6,100 has lost momentum. As a result, the door is now open for the bears to make their presence felt over the next 24 hours, and prices could be forced down to $6,300. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,580 on Bitfinex, having faced rejection at the 50-day EMA level of $6,649 earlier today.  As seen on the daily chart, the 50-day EMA has been capping the upside in BTC since late September. It is worth noting that BTC is trading below all three major moving averages – 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day EMA – which could be considered a bearish sign. However, these averages are flatlined, which indicates that BTC has lacked a clear directional bias for far too long. As a result, a big move in either direction is overdue.  Over on the 4-hour chart, BTC is trading just below the lower edge of the ascending triangle, meaning the bull failure at the 50-day EMA is beginning to prove costly. Furthermore, the relative strength index (RSI) has fallen back below 50.00 in bearish territory. A downside break would be confirmed if the current or the next 4-hour candle closes below the triangle support. In that case, BTC could fall quickly to $6,328 (Sept. 28 low).

" Bitcoin traded in a range of just under $1,500 over the course of the month of September, its narrowest monthly trading range since July 2017, data reveals. At close of trading Sunday, bitcoin (BTC) officially ended the 30-day period with a trading range of $1,329, with prices oscillating between a low of $6,100 and a high of $7,429. Overall, this was the lowest one-month range since July 2017, when bitcoin traded in a $1,095.8 window, according to data from Bitfinex.  Further, the monthly trading volume throughout September marked its lowest amount since April 2017, according to the exchange, one of the world’s largest. Periods of low volatility often come to a boisterous end for bitcoin especially when accompanied by low volume, so it seems the cryptocurrency is gearing up for a decisive move in either direction.   Bitcoin concluded its September candlestick inside the low and high of the prior month’s candlestick, creating a pattern known as the “inside bar pattern.” In trending markets, the pattern can present strong buy or sell signals if current prices surpass the range of the prior month.  Since the market for bitcoin has been in a bearish downtrend since December of 2017, current prices falling below the low of September ($6,100) would likely confirm more downside action is to come and set scope for prior support/resistance level near $4,900. On the other hand, if September’s range high is surpassed ($7,429), it would be a bullish indication for longer-term upside potential and possible bull market revival.  The current bear market draws many parallels to that of bitcoin’s bear market in 2014-15. Notably, the current bear market just began its 11th month, while prices now sitting on the 20-month moving average (MA) for support. The timing is rather impeccable when compared to the 2014 market since its 11th month also rested on the 20-month MA.  This would suggest a decisive move could be incoming since falling below the MA in the 12th month of the 2014 bear market further cemented the trend in bearish favor, of which it was unable to escape until returning above the MA in November of 2015.

" Bitcoin (BTC) seems to have built a base around a key moving average in the last four months, although, so far, it has not been able to produce a definitive bullish breakout. Throughout 2018, the leading cryptocurrency has set lower price highs, indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. Despite the bearish setup, the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) has served as a strong floor since June. More importantly, the failure to beat the EMA support for four straight months indicates that the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached in December has likely run its course. So, it seems safe to say that the stage has been set for the cryptocurrency to jump above the recent lower price high of $7,429 hit a month ago and confirm a bearish-to-bullish trend change. Even so, the bulls have been reluctant to push prices north of $6,800 in the last two weeks. Still, since BTC tends to perform well in the last three months of the calendar year, that may be about to change. At press time,  BTC is trading largely unchanged on the day at $6,585 on Bitfinex.  As seen on the monthly chart, BTC produced a minor rally to $8,500 in July, after finding support at the 21-month EMA in June. Further, the sellers failed to penetrate the EMA support in August and September, establishing it as a key level to watch out for in the near-term.  Over on the daily chart, the 5-day and 10-day EMAs are flatlined, indicating that the bitcoin market is currently lacking a clear directional bias. The outlook as per the daily chart would turn bullish if and when the cryptocurrency finds acceptance above the trendline connecting the July 25 high and Sept. 5 high. As of writing, the trendline resistance is located at $6,802. The bear failure, as seen in the monthly chart, does indicate scope for a break above the trendline hurdle in the near-term.

" Bitcoin (BTC) is reporting losses for a second straight month, but there are hints of a bullish breakout ahead in the fourth quarter. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,570 – down 6.30 percent from September’s opening price of $7,014. BTC also registered a 10-percent decline in August, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). However, despite the back-to-back monthly losses, the cryptocurrency is flashing a 2 percent gain for the third quarter. Further, the quarterly gain could have been much bigger had the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) not rejected a notable application for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Bitcoin jumped to a two-month high of $8,507 on July 25, confirming an upside break of the four-month-long falling channel. However, the long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change was short-lived as prices fell back below $8,000 on July 27, courtesy of the SEC’s second rejection of the Winklevoss brothers’ application for a bitcoin ETF. Nevertheless, the leading cryptocurrency posted a 21 percent gain in July, snapping the longest losing streak in nearly two years. BTC was down for the first two weeks the ETF rejection in late July. The cryptocurrency fell to a low of $5,859 on Bitfinex on Aug. 14 before rising back to $7,000 by the month’s end. Signaling a rotation of money out of high-risk alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin, and possibly into fiat currencies, the BTC dominance rate also rose above 50 percent for the first time since Dec. 19, 2017. It is worth noting that the SEC disapproved several other ETF proposals in the second half of August month. Yet, BTC remained well bid, possibly because the investor community had priced in the widely expected bad news. That resilience triggered speculation that better times lie ahead for the cryptocurrency and overshadowed the 10 percent monthly decline in prices. BTC’s rise to highs above $7,500 in the first half of the month was supplemented by the bullish turn in the weekly MACD. As a result, the cryptocurrency was looking likely to rise further toward July highs above $8,500. Instead, prices fell sharply on Sept. 5, leaving another lower high around $7,500 on the daily chart. The rising wedge breakdown on the daily chart signaled a resumption of the sell-off from the July highs. But, once again, the area around $6,000 proved a tough nut to crack for the bears. The cryptocurrency’s persistent defense of $6,000 has convinced many, including the likes of billionaire investor Novogratz and Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, that the BTC market is experiencing seller fatigue and has reached a bottom around $6,000. However, a bullish reversal would be confirmed only after BTC has found acceptance above the recent lower price high of $7,429.  On the weekly chart, BTC has charted a narrowing price range. Interestingly, the upper edge of the range is located around that $7,429 (August high) price point. A move above that level would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change and allow a stronger rally toward key resistances located at $8,507 (July high) and even $9,990 (May high). Any bullish move post-breakout could be a rapid one as a prolonged period of range-bound trading is often followed by a big spike in volatility, according to technical theory. The prospects of BTC witnessing bull breakout in the fourth quarter are high as the cryptocurrency tends to perform well in the last three months of the calendar year, seasonality analysis indicates. if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""JKCPP""]={},window.datawrapper[""JKCPP""].embedDeltas={""100"":460.020834,""200"":433.020834,""300"":407.020834,""400"":407.020834,""500"":407.020834,""700"":407.020834,""800"":407.020834,""900"":407.020834,""1000"":407.020834},window.datawrapper[""JKCPP""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-JKCPP""),window.datawrapper[""JKCPP""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""JKCPP""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""JKCPP""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""JKCPP""==b)window.datawrapper[""JKCPP""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""});  As can be seen on the above performance table, the cryptocurrency scored gains in the fourth quarter in six out of the last eight years.

" Bitcoin missed a bull breakout by a whisker, as prices backed off from a six-day high of $6,826 hit earlier today. BTC’s persistent defense of $6,000 over the last three months has convinced many, including billionaire investor Novogratz, that the leading cryptocurrency has bottomed out around that level (February low). However, a bullish breakout would be confirmed only after the cryptocurrency has found acceptance above the top edge of the three-month-long narrowing price range. Crossing that key price hurdle is proving a tough task for the bulls, though. For instance, BTC was solidly bid in early European hours, but the bullish momentum ran out of steam as prices neared the upper end of the narrowing price range, currently located at $6,870. As a result, a definitive breakout remains elusive. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,645 on Bitfinex, representing a 2.5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  On the weekly chart, the area around $6,000 (February low) has repeatedly capped the downside in BTC, which indicates that sellers have likely run dry, having pushed the cryptocurrency down by 70 percent from its record high of $20,000 hit in December.  As seen in the above chart, BTC has formed a large narrowing price range pattern known as a pennant, over the last three months.  A UTC close above the pennant hurdle of $6,870 would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change. More importantly, the ensuing bullish move could be a rapid one as a prolonged period of range-bound trading is often followed by a big spike in volatility, according to technical theory. And, even though the stacking order of the 50-day moving average (MA), below the 100-day MA, below the 200-day MA, is indicating that the path of least resistance is to the downside, price action always takes precedence over lagging indicators like MAs Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" In crypto markets, history doesn’t repeat itself, but it does rhyme. In light of ether’s emphatic and near 40 percent recovery in price since mid-September, there’s reason to believe the calls for a “bottom” in the price of ethereum’s cryptocurrency ether (ETH) do have some merit. As it turns out, the current market structure of ETH against its BTC pair is very similar to that of the structure formed during its bottom in December of 2017 before its more than 400 percent bull run.  There is a concept known as “fractals” in technical analysis, which is essentially repeating market structures. Since technical analysis is largely the study of investor behavior, there is a case for theorizing that a repeated market structure can resolve similar to how it did in the past.  If this were to come to fruition, a bottom in ETH/BTC would act as a leading indicator for its USD pair and for the altcoin market in general. Since the majority of altcoins are programmed following the ERC-20 token standard using the ethereum blockchain, there has long been a positive correlation between the performance of ETH and the rest of the altcoin market.   In the above chart, the left panel represents the 2017 market bottom for ETH/BTC after an 84 percent decline from an all-time high of 0.1515 and the right panel represents the current market structure whose bottom is a similar 82 percent decline from all-time highs.  Visually, the two market structures look similar, but there are three distinct similarities that are worth exploring below.  Forming a low above a previous low is known as a “higher low (HL)” and is a sign of bullish move gathering momentum. Further, a “higher high (HH)” pattern also indicates that the bull market is strengthening.  This HL-HH pattern is evident in both charts on the 4-hour time frame and interestingly, the second higher low in both structures formed on the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement.  Exponential moving averages (EMAs) are created by averaging the price of an asset over a specified period of time while putting more weight on recent price information. The tool is useful for traders because price tends to find support or resistance on the EMAs, and the longer the period, the stronger its effect.   The 100 and 200-period EMAs are highlighted in both charts because the way price reacted to them is very comparable. In both cases, the ETH/BTC ratio struggled to find acceptance above the 200 EMA (purple). The price fell back to the 100 EMA (yellow) where it found support and formed its second higher low.  Interestingly, history is rhyming at near identical price levels.  Last but not the least, the rising wedge breakdown confirmed earlier this month looks similar to the one we saw in December 2016.  It is worth noting that the rising wedge is a bearish reversal pattern and is expected to produce a significant sell-off upon confirmation. However, if a significant sell-off does not materialize, then the emboldened bulls usually make a strong comeback, the way they did in December 2017. A similar thing may happen this time as ETH/BTC has bounced off the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement, giving hope to bulls that the breakdown may once again be short-lived.  Using fractals to compare past and present market structures is speculative in nature since history never repeats exactly as it did before. It’s worth playing devil’s advocate to identify differences between the two structures and how things might go awry.  Flipping resistance to support is a bullish price development which was evident in the 2017 market structure but is lacking in the current structure. As can be seen, price in 2017 was able to form its second higher low directly on top of what was a prior resistance level, a bullish sign.  Once again, price found support on top of prior resistance when it spilled out of form its rising wedge, further showing its bullish strength. The current market structure could be seen as less bullish since it failed to hold prior resistance as strong support when it formed its second higher low.    ETH still has some proving to do, and there’s no guarantee this will play out, but it will surely be something interesting watch unfold over the coming days.

" A three-month long bitcoin price squeeze (BTC) could be nearing an end, with a key volatility indicator reaching its lowest level for 21 months. The leading cryptocurrency has charted lower price highs and lower price lows (pennant) since the end of June and the lack of strong direction bias has both bulls and the bears waiting on the sidelines. As a result, volatility as represented by Bollinger bands width – a technical analysis tool derived from +2, -2 standard deviations of a price’s moving average – has hit the lowest level since December 2016. When measured by standard deviation across all exchanges, volatility is at the lowest since July 2017, according to Bitcoinity. It is worth noting that an extended period of low volatility usually paves way for a strong directional bias, meaning bitcoin could soon witness a big move in either direction. At press time, BTC is trading at $6,490 on Bitfinex. Over on the daily chart, BTC is trapped in a pennant pattern. As of writing, the top edge (resistance) of the pennant is located at $6,900 and the lower edge (support) is seen at $6,270. The Bollinger bandwidth (gap between Bollinger bands divided by 20-day moving average) has dropped to a 21-month low of 0.0975 today. Further, the oscillator is showing that volatility has steadily declined over the last nine months. So, it seems safe to say that a spike in volatility (big move in prices) is overdue and going by the moving average studies on the long-term charts, it could happen on the downside, that is, the pennant support could be breached.  The 5-period and 10-period exponential moving averages (MAs) have produced a bearish crossover on the monthly chart for the first time since the second half of 2014. More importantly, the bearish cross has gained more credence, courtesy of BTC’s drop from the weekend high of $6,841 to the previous day’s low of $6,325.  Over on the hourly chart, BTC is struggling to pick up a bid despite the bullish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) and an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout. All of which indicates that bearish sentiment is quite strong. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" The trustee for the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox has revealed new details about the pace of cryptocurrency sales as part of the firm’s bankruptcy and rehabilitation process. Attorney Nobuaki Kobayashi explained in a September 25 notice on the Mt. Gox website that over $230 million dollar’s worth of bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH) had been exchanged for fiat currency between March 18 and the start of civil rehabilitation on June 22. According to the notice, the trustee sold 24,658.00762 BTC and 25,331.00761 BCH – quantities that brought in 25,975,702,352 Japanese yen, or $230,269,821.82. Following the sale, the balance in the trustee account was “approximately JPY 70,059 million,” or around $621 million, Kobayashi added. In the notice, the trustee also explained that a trust has been set up to preserve funds in fiat for bankruptcy creditors of the exchange. Explaining the move to sell off the cryptos before the civil rehabilitation was initiated, Kobayashi wrote it was “necessary and appropriate to procure a suitable amount of money to secure the interests [of] the creditors for the principal amount and delay damages of the determined and undetermined bankruptcy claims” before the trust was set up. While some creditors had applied for fiat refunds from the remaining holdings of Mt. Gox, others had requested to have their balances in cryptocurrency returned, since the values of BTC and BCH have climbed far above the levels seen at the time of the exchange’s closure in 2014. While likely good news for creditors seeking to be repaid in fiat, the sell-offs haven’t been welcomed by some quarters of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Indeed, some have argued that the Gox trustee sales are partially behind the bear market seen across cryptocurrencies since the start of the year. Back in March, CoinDesk reported that $400 million in BTC and BCH had been sold off in the preceding months by the Gox trustee, with Kobayashi stressing that the process was being carried out in a way that would not negatively impact the market.

" Bitcoin (BTC) is on the defensive, having breached crucial support on Monday and could suffer a deeper drop, courtesy of a bearish crossover between key moving averages. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,420 on Bitfinex, representing a 3 percent drop on a 24-hour basis. The bullish break above $6,600 witnessed on Friday had set the tone for a move toward the psychological hurdle of $7,000. However, the rally in alternative cryptocurrencies fizzled out over the weekend. As a result, while BTC managed to hit 17-day highs above $6,800 on Saturday, it fell back below $6,600 yesterday, neutralizing the bullish outlook. Further, the pullback from the weekend high of $6,841 to today’s low of $6,370 validates the bearish view put forward by the negative moving average crossover on the monthly chart. Hence, BTC risks falling to the major support at $6,000 in the next few days.  Over on the daily chart, BTC has found acceptance below the double bottom neckline of $6,600. The bull failure, though encouraging, is not enough to call a bearish reversal. Moreover, BTC is still trapped in the large pennant, and a UTC close below the lower edge of the pattern would confirm a revival of the sell-off from May highs above $8,500. That said, the probability of a downside break is high as per the long duration chart.  As seen in the above chart, the 5-month exponential moving average (MA) crossed the 10-month EMA from above at the turn of the last month, confirming a bearish crossover. More importantly, BTC’s failure to hold above the MAs over the weekend added credence to the negative MA signal. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin has pulled back from 17-days highs clocked over the weekend and risks losing bullish bias if prices close below $6,600, technical studies indicate. A break below that level will make it far harder for the bulls to force a major upside breakout above the crucial resistance at $6,970. However, if prices hold above $6,600 in the next 24 hours, that target may be achievable. The leading cryptocurrency was solidly bid on Friday likely due to an increased investor interest in XRP and other alternative cryptocurrencies. Notably, prices flew past $6,600, confirming a double bottom bullish reversal and opening doors to the psychological support of $7,000. However, the altcoin rally fizzled out over the weekend. For instance, XRP, which was reporting a 75 percent gain at $0.77 in the US hours on Friday, fell back to $0.50 just a day later and is currently threatening to drop below that level. Further, Friday’s other big gainers like aurora and monacoin shed a major chunk of their gains over the weekend. As a result, the rally in BTC was cut short at a 17-day high of $6,841 on Saturday. At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,610 on Bitfinex – down 1.8 percent on a 24-hour basis.  Over on the daily chart, a sustained break below $6,600 (neckline support) would invalidate the bullish setup indicated by Friday’s double bottom breakout. It’s worth noting that the cryptocurrency found takers below that level on Saturday. So, the bears may want to see back-to-back UTC closes below $6,000 before jumping the gun. Should the cryptocurrency defend $6,000 in the next 24 hours, then the top edge of the pennant pattern, currently located at $6,970, could come into play.  The weekly chart shows that BTC created a bullish outside-week candle last week, adding credence to the persistent defense of $6,00–$5,800 range over the last three months. As a result, the odds of BTC rising to the pennant resistance of $6,970 in the near-term are high. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Simple trading methods like the trend-following approach work best when trading cryptocurrencies or financial markets in general. While several technical indicators help identify changes in the strength, momentum, and duration of a trend, none are simpler and more widely used than the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). By definition, the MACD “turns two trend-following indicators, moving averages, into a momentum oscillator by subtracting the longer moving average from the shorter moving average.” Since the MACD is a “trend following” or “lagging” indicator, it trails pricing events that have already happened in order to gauge the strength of the current trend.  Like with most indicators though, money is made by understanding how to use the indicator rather than how it works, but it’s worth explaining the inner workings of the MACD so you get an idea why it is such a beloved indicator. There are three main components to the MACD indicator: the MACD line (blue oscillator), the signal line (orange oscillator) and the histogram.   The explanation may be hard to wrap your head around, but the MACD is one of the easiest indicators to use because of how simply it’s data is visually represented. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it is known as a bullish cross and when it crosses below, its known as a bearish cross. The crosses indicate a shift in trend momentum and represent buy or sell signals depending on the type of cross.  BTC/USD Daily Chart  As can be seen, MACD crosses tend to provide confirmation of a trend change, at least in the short term.  For example, on November 16, 2017, the MACD line made a bullish cross above the signal line, presenting a buy signal. The MACD stayed above the signal line for over a month when the rice went on to rally more than 150 percent before its next bearish cross. The bear cross occurred on Dec. 20, 2017, which signaled a bullish-to-bearish trend change. It’s recommended to use the MACD in conjunction with other indicators like volume, RSI or price action because like any indicator the MACD is not 100 percent accurate and can give off false signals. For example, the bullish crosses in January and March were relatively flat and failed to stay above the signal line for very long, resulting in short-lived price rallies and poor buy signals.  The MACD is great for identifying possible changes in a trend. But it can also identify overbought or oversold market conditions, as we’ll explore below.  The conditions are presented when the MACD and signal line separate too far away from both one another as well as the zero line.  BTC/USD Weekly Chart  As can be seen, the MACD line began to stray noticeably far away from the signal line in December of 2017. Also at this time, both the MACD and Signal were well above the zero line.  The combination of the two warned investors that the surge in price action was causing over-extended market conditions and a pullback was becoming likely.  The zero line marks the midpoint of the MACD oscillator. When the 12 EMA crosses above the 26 EMA, the MACD crosses above the zero line, presenting a buy signal. Conversely, when the 12 EMA crosses below the 26 EMA, the MACD crosses below the zero line and presents a sell signal.  The histogram (pink bars) quantifies the distance between the MACD and the signal line. The histogram prints a bar above the zero line when the MACD is above the signal line and prints below when the MACD is below the signal line. The size of the bar depends on the how great the distance is between the two lines.  As you can see in the above chart, the histogram reaches its highest level when the MACD is at its farthest point above the signal line, implying the rally is becoming overstretched.  Once the pullback occurs, the bearish MACD cross and histogram retreating below the zero line cemented the trend in bearish favor. The MACD is a great tool for the trend following traders, whether you’re a beginner or a professional. It depicts buy and sell signals simply by the crossing of two lines, so even the most novice traders can quickly become comfortable with the tool.

" The issuance of tether (USDT), the controversial cryptocurrency tied to the U.S. dollar’s value, has had no meaningful impact on the price of bitcoin, an academic study has found. The findings by Dr. Wang Chun Wei, a lecturer at the business school of Australia’s University of Queensland, contradict widespread and long-running speculation that Tether, the company behind the stable cryptocurrency, has been issuing USDT to pump up the price of bitcoin. Wei’s findings have been accepted for the October 2018 issue of Economics Letters. (The paper was originally published online in May.) In the paper, “The Impact of Tether Grants on Bitcoin,” he writes: “Our findings show that tether grants were potentially timed to follow bitcoin downturns and subsequent bitcoin/tether trading volumes increased … However, the impact of tether grants on bitcoin returns were not statistically significant, and therefore tether issuances cannot be an effective tool for moving bitcoin prices.” Tether is the market’s leading stablecoin. It maintains a steady price of about $1, ostensibly by backing each USDT with one U.S. dollar in reserve – though this claim is often disputed and hard to verify since Tether has not published a full audit. While the token has been valuable to exchanges, at least one top-20 exchange has recently moved to shift to a new alternative. Wei’s research focuses on the volume of USDT in the market and changes to that volume. It does not address controversies around the amount of U.S. dollars actually backing USDT. “This is for regulators and auditors to determine,” Wei writes. Instead, the paper simply addresses whether or not the issuance of new USDT could be used to manipulate the price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency. That critique of USDT has been articulated by the anonymous author of January’s “The Tether Report,” who wrote: “The highly correlated growth between tether issuance and bitcoin price raises several interesting questions: Is bitcoin growth driving Tether? Is tether issuance driving bitcoin? If one were to assume the worst case scenario, that bitcoin’s price has been artificially pumped up by tether issuance, one would expect the market price of bitcoin to be closer to $2,000 based on the trendline before April 2017 and the marked growth in tether issuance.” Tether Limited issues new USDT periodically in large lots typically referred to as grants. According to Wei: “The grants seem to occur in groups. I think Tether Limited breaks the grants into smaller blocks and issues them out over a couple of days.” Wei summarized the critique of Tether Limited’s detractors for CoinDesk, writing: “If tether tokens were not fully backed, then for the company to issue new tokens would be equivalent of printing money. If this was true, tether grants/issuances would be equivalent to ‘monetary easing’ in the cryptocurrency markets.” In monetary or quantitative easing, an increased money supply aims to boost economic activity by expanding liquidity. “It was argued that most of the increased Tether was used to purchase bitcoin,” Wei explained. “My paper tries to test this theory out empirically. Is it true that tether grants pushed up bitcoin prices?” The paper notes that bitcoin-tether trading pairs dominate across major exchanges and that more than $2 billion worth of USDT exists on the market. Further, it notes that trading in bitcoin does increase following new USDT grants. Nevertheless, that observation can be misleading. Acknowledging that trading volume is correlated with price, Wei went on to say: “However, you cannot use trading volume to predict price, as the effect is simultaneous. In my paper, I state that past trading volumes do not impact future returns.” To investigate these questions, Wei used two time-series models to input different variables over time and see if there was a causal relationship. The models specifically looked for evidence of changes going forward from new grants. He uses an “autoregressive distributed lag” model and also an “unrestricted vector autoregression” (VAR). Both of these are ways of investigating whether or not there is a causal relationship between something in the past and something in the future. Wei broke it down in layman’s terms: “We have a null model that tries to explain bitcoin returns using past bitcoin returns. We have a full model that tries to explain bitcoin returns using past bitcoin returns and past tether grants.” He summarized: “We then show the full model isn’t actually any better than the null model. Hence, past tether grants must have no impact on bitcoin returns.” In other words, when you add variables about USDT, it doesn’t show any direct impact on BTC returns any better than just looking at BTC on its own. “In fact, when we examine the bitcoin return equation of our VAR model, none of the lagged variables impacts bitcoin returns. This suggests bitcoin returns are showing greater signs of market efficiency than previously studied on older datasets,” Wei writes in the paper. Wei went on to argue that this makes intuitive sense, once the size of the bitcoin market is considered. “The grants come roughly at $100-250 million blocks. The daily trading volume of bitcoin is roughly $5-10 billion USD. At its peak, it was roughly $20 billion,” he told CoinDesk. “So the impact of tether is small. Claims saying that it is tether that props up bitcoin are definitely not true.” Prices on screen image via Shutterstock",2018-09-21
" Bitcoin (BTC) has taken a bullish turn over the last 24 hours, as sharp gains are also seen across a number of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins). As of writing, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,700 on Bitfinex – up 4.6 percent on a 24-hour basis – having hit a 16-day high of $6,745 earlier today. BTC’s recovery from the five-week low of $6,100 hit Wednesday was likely fueled by increased investor demand for altcoins. For instance, XRP – the third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization – has risen by 42 percent in the last 24 hours and 18 percent of the total XRP trading volume is coming from XRP/BTC pairs, according to CoinMarketCap. Aurora (AOA) is up 57 percent on the day and is the best performing cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap. More importantly, about 60 percent of its total trading volume is also originating from pairs with BTC. On similar lines, MONA’s 43 percent price rise is likely being fueled by MONA/BTC and MONA/JPY pairs, volume data shows. It’s worth noting that most alternative cryptocurrencies are traded against majors like BTC and ethereum’s ETH token. So, money tends to flow into altcoins via BTC, creating upside pressure on the leading cryptocurrency. As a result, BTC could be in for further gains if the altcoin rally keeps attracting investors to the market. On the charts, the convincing move above $6,600 (Sept. 14 high) is painting a bullish picture, at least for the short-term.  As seen in the above chart, BTC moved past the double bottom neckline resistance of $6,600 earlier today, confirming a bullish reversal. The cryptocurrency may well move to test the upper edge of the pennant pattern, currently located at $7,050, over the weekend. A UTC close above that level would add credence to higher price lows set over the last three months and bring potential for a move towards July highs above $8,500.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) has made a high volume recovery from five-week lows, although a bullish reversal is still not confirmed, technical studies indicate. The leading cryptocurrency fell to $6,100 on Bitfinex at 18:00 UTC yesterday – the lowest level since Aug. 14 – signaling a downside break of the trendline connecting the June low and Aug. 11 low (lower edge of the pennant). However, the cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid just an hour later and jumped to a high of $6,550. More importantly, trading volumes on Bitfinex increased by 66 percent during the price recovery. While the persistent failure to beat the key support could be taken as a sign of bearish exhaustion, the upside is seen gathering pace only above $6,600 (Sept. 14 high). At press time, BTC is trading at $6,400, representing a 1.10 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  As can be seen, the big move higher witnessed during the 60 minutes leading up to 19:00 UTC yesterday was backed by a jump in trading volumes. However, so far, the follow-through has been anything but encouraging. Nevertheless, the strong rebound from $6,100 has established the figure as a key near-term support.  Bitcoin remains stuck in no-man’s land on the daily chart defined by the lower end of the pennant pattern and the Sept. 14 high of $6,600. As of writing, the pennant support is located at $6,225. A UTC close below that level would signal a revival of the sell-off from May highs near $10,000. On the other hand, a move above $6,600 would imply a double bottom bullish reversal. This scenario is looking increasingly likely, courtesy of repeated rebounds at the lower end of the pennant pattern. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin’s volatility was on full display on Wednesday when its price fell from $6,300 to $6,100 before shooting up to $6,500 – all within an hour’s time.  As of press time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at $6,422, up 5 percent from the day’s low of $6,117. The market did not waste time making its bullish move, scaling over 6 percent in less than 20 minutes to ultimately hit a high of $6,494, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Coincidentally, the move occurred within just minutes of a CBOE Bitcoin Futures expiration. Bitcoin futures expirations have been documented as having a turbulent effect on the price of the underlying cryptocurrency, so an increase in market volatility perhaps could have been foreseen. Bitcoin’s move today is more shocking than its usual volatility, as an important technical level of price support of $6,200 was breached, signaling bears were primed to drive prices lower. Evidently, that turned out not to be the case since it is clear demand still exists above the $6,000 mark. CoinMarketCap data shows that the total market capitalization for the cryptocurrency market rose to roughly $201 billion during the market uptick, up roughly 4 percent and $8 billion from Wednesday’s low.  At the time of writing, the 24-hour growth for other well-known cryptocurrencies is not quite as dramatic, although seven of the ten biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization have seen positive price developments. Cardano (ADA) is leading the pack, currently printing a six percent appreciation compared to Tuesday’s figures.  Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin (BTC) is trapped in a no-man’s land between $6,200 and $6,600, technical charts indicate. A bear flag breakdown witnessed Monday was expected to yield a drop to $6,000 (February low), but bitcoin’s resilience spoiled the bear party. The leading cryptocurrency bounced off trendline support at $6,202 on the same day and has since risen back above $6,350, neutralizing the immediate bearish outlook. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,320 on Bitfinex – up 1.23 percent on the day. While BTC’s defense of the trendline support is encouraging, a bearish-to-bullish trend change would be confirmed only after BTC has moved above the Sept. 14 high of $6,600. As can be seen, the trendline from June lows (the lower end of the pennant) has worked as a strong support this month and is the level to beat for the bears. As of writing, pennant support is located at $6,225. A UTC close below that level would confirm a pennant breakdown – a bearish continuation pattern – which would signal a revival of the sell-off from May highs near $10,000. A breakdown, if it comes, could prove costly: the relative strength index (RSI) of 41.00 is bearish and well above oversold levels, suggesting plenty of scope for a price drop. Meanwhile, on the higher side, a move above $6,600 (Sept. 14 high) would negate Monday’s big bearish outside-day candle and confirm a short-term bullish reversal.  The bear flag breakdown on the 4-hour chart failed to produce a bearish move toward $6,000. More importantly, BTC has re-entered the flag pattern, weakening the bearish case. That said, the stacking order of the 50-candle moving average (MA), below the 100-candle MA, below the 200-candle MA, indicates the path of least resistance is to the downside. Further, the RSI is beginning to roll over in favor of the bears. So, it seems safe to say that prospects of a bull breakout above $6,600 are low.

" Don Wilson, founder of high-speed trading firm DRW, said bitcoin derivatives trading in Asia hours is almost equal to the volume he’s seen in the U.S., something he says is an anomaly when compared to other financial instruments. In a fireside chat at the CoinDesk Consensus Singapore 2018 conference with Quartz’s John Detrixhe, Wilson discussed his observations on cryptocurrency trading trends and his view on the future for the technology. Referencing bitcoin futures trading data on U.S. exchanges provided by CME and CBOE, Wilson went so far as to suggest there may be demand for similar trading tools in Asia. He told attendees: “If you look at the bitcoin futures data from CME and CBOE, volume in Asia hours are almost the same wth the U.S. … Whereas in like foreign exchange, even for the Japanese yen-dollar trading, volume in Asia is significantly lower.” DRW, one of the earliest institutions that moved into cryptocurrency trading, launched Cumberland, a crypto over-the-counter trading desk in 2014, at a time when others such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have yet to officially roll out similar services. Explaining the initial idea of DRW to start a crypto trading desk, Wilson said it is rooted in his belief that crypto’s decentralization feature. “There’s the argument about bitcoin as a store of value. But, more interesting to me, is the usefulness of bitcoin. The ability of transfer values without a trust in the system is hugely disruptive,” he said. Last year, the Wall Street Journal reported that Cumberland had traded more than $20 billion worth of bitcoin, ether and other crypto assets since 2016. Wilson added that custody solution could be one key obstacle at the moment to a wider institution adoption of crypto trading as he sees that as a crucial stepping stone.  Elsewhere in the fireside chat, Wilson also commented on yesterday’s report by the New York Office of the Attorney General, one which saw the regulator releasing findings indicating several crypto exchange may be involved in market manipulation and the violation of state laws. While agreeing to most of the arguments made by the regulator, Wilson sees “one of the biggest problems in this industry is the lack of clarity from regulators on what the rules are,” concluding: “Such uncertainty could drive away innovative projects in the space to other jurisdictions with clearer guidelines such as Switzerland and Singapore.” Cumberland image via Consensus Singapore",2018-09-19
" Bitcoin’s (BTC) drop to five-day lows on Monday has likely emboldened the bears, technical studies indicate. The leading cryptocurrency traded in a sideways manner over the weekend, neutralizing the immediate bullish outlook. However, the consolidation was expected to end with an upside break, as the short-term moving averages (MAs) turned bullish on Saturday, adding credence to positive relative strength index divergence (RSI). Instead, BTC dived out of the trading range in the US session yesterday and fell to a low of $6,203 – the lowest level since Sept. 12 – indicating the corrective rally from the recent lows near $6,100 has likely ended at Friday’s high of $6,600. More importantly, the drop witnessed yesterday signaled a revival of the sell-off from highs above $7,400 seen earlier this month. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,250 on Bitfinex – down 3 percent on a 24-hour basis.  The bear flag breakdown seen in the above chart is a bearish continuation pattern, meaning the sell-off from the Sept. 2 high of $7,429 has resumed and prices could fall as low as $5,000 (target as per the measured move method). However, that target looks far-fetched for now. Nevertheless, with RSI at 34.00 (bearish and well above the oversold level), the bear flag breakdown could yield a drop to the August low of $5,859 in the near-term. The bearish outlook would gain more credence if BTC finds acceptance below the key trendline support, as seen in the chart below.  As can be seen, the trendline connecting the June 24 low and Aug. 11 low capped the downside in BTC earlier this month and is living up to its reputation as a key support today. That said, the probability of a downside break is high this time, as BTC suffered a bear flag breakdown on the 4-hour chart and created a bearish outside-day candle yesterday, putting the bears back into the driver’s seat. A UTC close below the trendline support, currently seen at $6,214, would confirm a downside break of the large pennant pattern and accentuate the bearish pressure.

" For a small but growing community of users in the Palestinian territories of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, bitcoin has become a lifeline. Ahmed Ismail, a financial analyst in Gaza, estimated there are at least 20 unofficial “exchange” offices there dealing cryptocurrency to local users. Ismail himself helps 30 clients use bitcoin to purchase investments abroad, such as stocks, since there aren’t any local alternatives for putting money to work. One such currency dealer in Gaza, Mohammed, told CoinDesk over the past four years he helped up to 50 families a month purchase an average of $500 worth of bitcoin each to send money abroad or shop online. “Bitcoin, in their opinion, is cheaper, safer, and quicker,” he said. “Nothing works with Palestinian banks. Bitcoin wallets are alternative banks.” While Palestine is not the only politically and economically isolated part of the world where cryptocurrency is making inroads, it’s somewhat unique among these markets in terms of the drivers – and limitations – to adoption. For example, Palestinians do not face the kind of hyperinflation that drives Venezuelans, Iranians and Turks to hodl a digital currency with a limited supply, since they don’t have a national currency at all, instead using stable foreign currencies. But another core property of public blockchain networks is particularly appealing in the Palestinian territories: censorship-resistance. Anyone can conduct a peer-to-peer bitcoin transaction. Once the transaction is paid for, it can’t be vetoed by an intermediary. This would appear to solve a real problem for a population with restricted access to the global economy amid the ongoing conflict with Israel. Even supporters in the West have had their bank accounts shut down for sending money to Palestinians. “There is no payment gateway, like PayPal, for entrepreneurs to receive payments internationally,” Laith Kassis, CEO of the nonprofit Palestine Techno Park in the West Bank, told CoinDesk. “So here comes solutions on blockchain with private nodes.” (The local alternative, PalPay, predominantly serves Bank of Palestine customers rather than offering a gateway to global commerce.) However, an electronic currency can only do so much in a place where power outages can be a daily occurrence and even traditional banks sometimes struggle to transact with much of the outside world. While sending or receiving bitcoin may be frictionless, on- and off-ramps just don’t exist in the Palestinian territories. There’s no way for Palestinians to get their Israeli shekels, U.S. dollars or Jordanian dinars to online crypto exchanges since none of them work with local banks. Hence, they must rely on dealers as liquidity gateways, and that adds friction back in. One Palestinian tech worker told CoinDesk that when she tried to cash out a bitcoin payment from a remote employer, she couldn’t get a fair fiat price from dealers in Gaza because crypto prices were soaring at the time. As such, Saifdean Ammous, the Palestinian-born author of “The Bitcoin Standard,” is skeptical about any claims that the cryptocurrency currently offers a solution to his homeland’s economic straits. “If the people who want to do the transaction don’t both have balances in bitcoin then you’re just adding extra layers of conversion from their home currency to bitcoin and back to the home currency,” said Ammous, who is a professor of economics at the Lebanese American University. “That’s never going to be a sustainable solution.” Another non-starter, in his view, is the Palestinian Monetary Authority‘s publicly touted plans to create a national cryptocurrency. Ammous said it “completely misses the point to think of bitcoin as a payment solution that can be added onto existing monetary systems.” He added: “Rather, it [bitcoin] is its own monetary system and it will have its own payment solutions.” Plus, Palestinian communities revolve around local trust networks and physical assets like cash, because high unemployment and poverty rates create urgent daily needs. According to World Bank estimates, 21 percent of Palestinians live below the poverty line on less than $5.50 a day. In that context, volatile and illiquid assets are predominately useful for cross-border transactions, but not everyday ones. On the other hand, tech industry optimists like Kassis take a different approach than Ammous or Ismail by engaging with the PMA. Kassis’s Techno Park hosted its first blockchain boot camp the first week of September, with 29 participants ranging from students to entrepreneurs and government officials. By the end of the five-day technical boot camp, several developers were working on new applications. Representatives of the PMA have participated in the center’s educational programming. “The whole ethos of decentralized ledgers plays into the [Palestinian] community’s need to talk peer-to-peer, that will enable Palestinian entrepreneurs to do business internationally,” Kassis said, adding: “I think blockchain and fintech has a huge potential to change the dynamics of our economy and solve many of the financial constraints [by] leveraging the decentralization of the network.” Kassis said he hopes upcoming programs like the Techno Park crypto hackathon later this year will leverage Diaspora connections to foster local expertise for institutional payment solutions. So far, the Techno Park’s blockchain seminars at four universities across the West Bank have discussed government-sponsored pilots, enterprise crypto services provided by companies like Ripple, and initial coin offerings, in addition to bitcoin. “It’s all about bringing awareness and creating new markets,” Kassis said. “The younger generation is more knowledgeable about crypto, more than the IT departments at banks.” And even if it’s too soon for bitcoin to make much difference now, Ammous said he believes that in the long term it has great potential to spark societal change. Ammous argues that governments, including those in the Middle East, have been able to fund destructive ideas, such as wars, precisely because of their ability to issue unbacked fiat via central banks. “The key thing is that the more it [bitcoin] grows, the more it will deprive governments of the ability to print more money,” Ammous said, concluding: “I think, in the long run, this is going to be a very good thing for everywhere in the world, particularly places in the Middle East.” Palestine image by Dominika Zarzycka; Shutterstock",2018-09-18
" The price of ether (ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, sank nearly $30 today, effectively erasing half of the 35 percent rally recorded last week.  At press time, ETH is trading across exchanges at an average price of $196 – down $28 and 11 percent on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk’s Ether Price Index (EPI).   The development came after what was a record-setting week for the cryptocurrency when it recorded its highest daily trading volume in over 12 months, most of which came from buyers. The surge in investor interest helped fuel a more than 35 percent rally in price from its weekly low of $167 set on September 12, to a high of $228 recorded just three days later.  The 12-month high in ETH trading volume proved to be a short-lived record, as it was surpassed by sellers today amid a broader market downturn.  At the time of writing, six of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are recording 24-hour losses above 6 percent, including the likes of bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC), cardano (ADA) and monero (XMR). EOS is leading the pack, currently printing a daily loss of over 12 percent.  Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency, is faring better than most today, dropping only 4 percent on a 24-hour basis. That said, its current price of $6,223 is within arm’s reach of an annual low near $5,800.  The risk-off sentiment currently plaguing the market will only get worse if bitcoin’s annual low is surpassed, as it will reaffirm that the bears are getting stronger in an already overwhelmingly bearish market.  Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.

" The corrective rally in bitcoin (BTC) could gather momentum if key resistance above $6,500 is crossed on the back of high volumes, according to technical charts. The leading cryptocurrency witnessed a symmetrical triangle breakout last week, opening doors for a stronger corrective rally towards $6,800–$7,000. However, despite the bullish setup, BTC was rejected near $6,600 on Friday and spent the weekend trading in a sideways manner in the range of $6,350–$6,550. As a result, the immediate bullish outlook has been neutralized. Further, trading volumes fell to a two-month low of $3.22 billion on Saturday, putting a question mark on the sustainability of the recovery from the recent lows near $6,100. That said, the corrective move could resume if the cryptocurrency sees a high volume bullish break from the three-day long narrowing price range. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,490 on Bitfinex – down 0.10 percent on a 24-hour basis. As can be seen, BTC has charted a narrowing price range over the weekend. A break above $6,540 (triangle resistance) would signal a continuation of the rally from the Sept. 8 low of $6,119. More importantly, it would strengthen the bullish case put forward by last week’s bullish relative strength index (RSI) divergence and symmetrical triangle breakout. On the other hand, a break below $6,380 (lower end of the narrowing price range) would signal an end of the corrective rally.  Over on the daily chart, the bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MA) indicates the path of least resistance in on the higher side. So, the cryptocurrency is more likely to extend the corrective rally in the short-run. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Having dropped back from eight-day highs hit this morning, bitcoin (BTC) price could be in for a bout of consolidation before further upside unfolds. The cryptocurrency rose to $6,596 earlier today on Bitfinex – the highest level since Sep. 6 – adding credence to the short-term bullish reversal signaled by the symmetrical triangle breakout earlier this week. However, despite the strengthening bullish case, BTC quickly lost around $200 soon before press time. As if writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,450, having printed an intraday low of $6,355 a few minutes ago. While the sudden price pullback could force investors to question the sustainability of the corrective rally, the short-term technical charts continue to show that the path of least resistance is on the higher side.  BTC’s retreat from the highs near $6,600 is likely associated with the bearish divergence of the relative strength index seen in the hourly chart. Indeed, the RSI has adopted a bearish bias, but it is premature to call an end of the technical recovery, as the major moving averages (MAs) – 50-hour, 100-hour, and 200-hour – are still trending north in favor of the bulls More importantly, the key MAs are capping the downside at press time. This leaves scope intact for a recovery to resistance at $6,800 (multiple daily highs).  On the daily chart, BTC closed (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA yesterday, neutralizing the bearish view put forward by the rising wedge breakdown on Sept. 5. However, the short-term MA is still sloping downwards. This, coupled with the bearish RSI divergence on the hourly chart could keep the cryptocurrency range-bound for the next 24 hours or so. It’s worth noting that technical recovery usually gathers speed after the short-term MAs bottom out – unless, of course, there is a major positive fundamental news.

" The cryptocurrency market has been making history for all the wrong reasons as of late, most notably by recently surpassing the plunge of the infamous Dot-Com bubble in the early 2000’s. With that said, cryptocurrencies tend to make recoveries when all hope is seemingly lost, and today’s price action of the world’s second largest cryptocurrency, ether and many others is no exception.  At press time, several of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are reporting 24-hour gains above 10 percent, including monero (XMR), litecoin (LTC), and EOS. Ether (ETH) is leading the pack while boasting a 17 percent price increase. Further, the total market cap has edged back up over $200 billion, after falling lower earlier this week. Still, it’s too early to call any type of long-term bullish reversal in the market, but there are three encouraging signs cryptocurrencies may see much-needed relief at least in the short term. Until today, the price of ETH/USD had fallen more than 40 percent since September 5 and 85 percent from its all-time high north of $1,400 set last December.  Today though, tells a different story. Since the low of $167.32 yesterday, price has recovered more than 20 percent reaching a 24-high of $207.67, according to data from the Bitfinex Exchange.  ETH/USD Daily Chart  As seen in the above chart, the recent price recovery can be attributed to finding support on the lower trend line of a falling wedge, a bullish reversal pattern, in a historical support zone depicted by the green box.  Further, the daily RSI was showing bullish divergence, giving all the more reason for a relief rally to occur.  In order to provide confirmation of a larger trend reversal, price would need to close a daily, more preferably a weekly, candlestick above wedge resistance with a notable increase in volume.  A common method of estimating the breakout target of a falling wedge is to add the base range to the breakout point. Since the base range of this wedge is over $900, a long-term measured objective for price would be in the $1100 area if price were to break out near $230.  Many alternative currencies are built on the ethereum blockchain, so a strong recovery from ETH would likely translate to a recovery for others as well.  The future prospects for cryptocurrencies in general are heavily dependent on bitcoin (BTC) – the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Down 70 percent from the record high of $20,000 reached in December, BTC could scare the most seasoned investor. However, a closer look at the long duration technical chart reveals the cryptocurrency is silently charting a major bullish reversal pattern. Weekly chart  As can be seen, BTC’s recovery from the low of $5,859 in August established the first higher low pattern of the year, the previous low being $5,755 hit in June. Further, the recent sell-off ended at $6,119, meaning another higher low has been created. The trendline connecting the higher lows indicates long-term bearish exhaustion. Hence, there is reason to be optimistic as long as prices hold above the trendline. What bulls need now is for BTC to set a higher high by moving above the July high of $8,507. That would confirm a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and could yield a sustained rally above $10,000. Risk assets across the globe have picked up a bid in the last 24 hours on reports that the U.S. and China are heading back to the negotiating table. For instance, the AUD/JPY pair, which is widely considered as a risk barometer of global markets, is up 1 percent at press time. Meanwhile, the dollar index is down 0.24 percent. Clearly, investors are hoping that these talks would yield results, however, trade wars would end only if the U.S. officially drops tariffs. More importantly, the past experience suggests such talks tend to break down in a few days.  That said, the renewed hopes of the U.S.-China trade talks could keep the risk assets well bid in the short-term.  Further, Turkey hiked rates by 625 basis points today to save its stumbling currency and the move has pushed equity markets higher across the globe.  All of this will likely bode well for the cryptocurrencies as the investor community still considers bitcoin and other innovations as risk assets.

" Bitcoin (BTC) is teasing a decent bullish move, having cleared crucial resistance a few hours ago. The leading cryptocurrency moved past $6,400 earlier today, signaling that bearish exhaustion – as indicated by Tuesday’s spinning bottom candle – is paving way for a corrective rally. Notably, the positive price action was preceded by a solid defense of the long-term trendline connecting the June low and Aug. 11 low and an upside break of the symmetrical triangle. As a result, the stage looks set for an upside move. However, caution is still the name of the game, as the bearish moving averages (MAs) could work as hurdles and complicate the recovery. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,450, having clocked a high of $6,490 earlier today, according to Bitfinex data.  The symmetrical triangle breakout, as seen in the above chart, indicates a bullish reversal, meaning the sell-off from the recent highs above $7,400 has ended and the bulls have regained control. Further, the 50-hour and 100-hour MAs are beginning to curl up in favor of the bulls. So, while there is a reason to be optimistic here, the downward sloping (bearish) 200-hour MA is warning the bulls against being too ambitious.  Over on the daily chart, the persistent bear failure to penetrate the lower end of the pennant pattern is finally yielding a bullish move. A UTC close today above $6,400 would further cement the short-term bullish case. However, as of writing, the downward sloping (bearish) 10-day moving average, is putting brakes on the price rally.

" Bitcoin (BTC) could witness a minor corrective rally if the bulls’ persistent defense of key support leads to a break above the resistance at $6,400, technical charts indicate. The leading cryptocurrency suffered a downside break of the symmetrical triangle in the early U.S. session yesterday, signaling a revival of the sell-off from the recent highs above $7,400. Further, the bearish pattern bolstered the already negative setup, as represented by the rising wedge breakdown and the pennant breakdown on the line chart. As a result, BTC was looking likely to test $6,000 (February low) before the UTC close yesterday. Instead, it bounced back from $6,170 — the support of the trendline connecting the June low and Aug. 11 low — and closed largely unchanged on the day at $6,290. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,250 on Bitfinex and the trendline support is seen slightly higher at $6,180.  As seen in the above chart, the lower end of the pennant pattern – the trendline sloping upwards from the June low – is proving a tough nut to crack. This could be considered a sign of bearish exhaustion, given that the crucial support is holding ground after a 16 percent drop. That argument has merit since the cryptocurrency created a “spinning bottom” candle yesterday, signaling indecision in the marketplace. A UTC close today above $6,400 (previous day’s high) would validate the spinning bottom candle, opening doors to a stronger corrective rally toward $6,830 (10-week moving average). On the other hand, acceptance below the pennant support will likely accentuate the bear case. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin (BTC) is being squeezed into a tight trading range with neither bulls nor bears having the upper hand, and a decisive move either way will likely set the tone for the next trend going forward. The $1,000 drop witnessed during a 24-hour period in the middle of the last week turned the tide in favor of the bears. As a result, the cryptocurrency was facing a risk of a drop to $6,000 over the weekend. Despite expectations, the sell-off unexpectedly ran out of steam at a low of $6,119 on Saturday. More importantly, the cryptocurrency has printed higher price lows in the last four days, signaling bearish exhaustion. Meanwhile, the bulls have not been exercising their buying power either, as indicated by the lower price highs around $6,400. So, it seems that the investor community is evenly split on the immediate prospects for the bitcoin market, leaving the cryptocurrency directionless. That said, the direction of the range breakout will likely play a big role in determining the short-term price trend. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,320 on Bitfinex, representing a 0.5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. Looking at the hourly chart, BTC is being squeezed between the two lines representing lower highs and higher lows. In technical parlance, this narrowing price range is referred to as the “symmetrical triangle”. A downside break of the range would add credence to the bearish pennant breakdown seen in the line chart and the rising wedge breakdown seen in the candlestick chart, with prices potentially dropping below $6,000 (February low). On the other hand, an upside break of the symmetrical triangle could allow a stronger corrective rally towards the 10-day moving average (MA), currently located at $6,660.  Over on the daily chart, the 5-day and 10-day MAs are trending south, indicating a bearish setup. The bears are also boosted by a rising wedge breakdown seen on Sep. 5. While either side could gain the upper hand going forward, prices are more likely to see a downside break of the symmetrical triangle, the hourly chart suggests.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) recovery from 25-day lows seen over the weekend has done little to alleviate the near-term bearish bias, technical studies indicate. The leading cryptocurrency fell to $6,119 on Bitfinex on Saturday – the lowest level since Aug. 14 – bolstering the bearish setup established by a sudden $1,000 drop witnessed during a 24-hour period in the middle of the last week. However, the drop to 3.5-week lows also pushed the intraday relative strength index (RSI) into oversold territory below 30.00. As a result, the sell-off has stalled in the last 36 hours, although corrective rallies have been shallow. Notably, the cryptocurrency’s failure to scale $6,400 in a convincing manner despite signs of bullish reversal on intraday charts indicates that bearish sentiment is still quite strong. Hence, the next big move is more likely to be on the downside. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,290, representing a 0.6 percent rise in a 24-hour basis. The rising wedge breakdown and the downward sloping 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs), as seen in the chart above, indicate the path of least resistance is to the downside. The RSI of 39.14 is also biased toward the bears.  As can be seen, BTC suffered a pennant breakdown on the daily line chart on Saturday, signaling a revival of the long-term bear market. Hence, prices could re-test the June lows below $5,800 in the next few days.  The bullish divergence of the RSI has set the stage for a stronger corrective rally, however, it is likely to happen only above the trendline hurdle, currently located at $6,420.

" The number of short orders placed on ether (ETH) reached a new all-time high during Friday’s trading session, according to data from the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex.  At approximately 10:00 UTC Friday, the number of shorts placed on ETH/USD, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, surpassed the prior mark of 202,854 to ultimately reach a new high of 208,689.  The new figure represents an 81.96 percent increase week-to-week and a 162 percent jump from mid-August.  The development follows an unfavorable week for the broader cryptocurrency market and ETH in particular. From September 5-6, bitcoin (BTC) fell more than $1100, accounting for a nearly 15 percent drop. In that time, over $40 billion was shed from the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies tend to follow bitcoin’s lead after a big move, and ETH was no exception. Three days ago, ETH was valued at $287 across exchanges but today is trading at $221, according to CoinDesk’s Ether Price Index (EPI). In all, the developments mark a more than 80 percent drop from ETH’s all-time high north of $1200, so it’s perhaps no surprise that investor confidence in ETH is at an all-time low.  When a short trade of this nature becomes overcrowded – as the new all-time high would suggest is the case – an astute investor has to consider the possibility of a “short squeeze.”  When short positions are stacked so high, a small increase in price could cause those shorting to close positions in order to avoid a losing trade. Since the only way to close a short is to buy back the cryptocurrency, it’s possible ETH could see a rapid price increase, also known as a “squeeze.” ETH/USD Shorts/Longs VS. Price  As seen in the above chart, an abundance of shorts failed to spark any type of short squeeze in June and July. At that time though, the longs were at a very low level, comparatively.  Looking at the data from a different angle, one could make the argument that short and long market conditions are more similar to that of last November and December, given the difference between the two is at very similar levels (depicted by the white line). What’s more, the relative strength index (RSI) is both diverging bullishly and printing low levels only seen in a few instances in years past. This suggests that the selling may be reaching an exhaustion point and that an upside rally remains a possibility.  While the idea of a short squeeze is comforting for bulls, it’s never a guarantee – and the lack of technical support levels below ETH/USD has certainly provided merit for the overcrowded trade.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) double-digit drop has torn down the scaffolding of what had seemed to be a developing long-term bull market just days ago. That said, a bearish reversal is still not confirmed either, technical studies indicate. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,422 on Bitfinex – down 13 percent from the previous day’s high of $7,404. Notably, BTC has erased all the gains made over the last two weeks in a single day. Further, the sharp drop has poured cold water over the optimism generated by the falling channel breakout and the bullish turn of the weekly MACD. Still, it is premature to call a long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change, as the prices are holding well above the crucial support of $6,000.  As seen in the above chart, the bears have repeatedly failed in the last 11 weeks to secure a weekly close (Sunday’s UTC close) below $6,000 (Feb. 6 low), signaling the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 has run out of steam. Hence, the bears will likely feel emboldened if BTC closes the week below $6,000. One way to gauge whether BTC is likely to end this week below the significant support level is to study the line chart. This paints a better picture of the broader trend by focusing only on the UTC close, unlike the candlestick chart, which also takes into account the daily high and low.  As can be seen, BTC has charted a pennant pattern on the daily line chart. A UTC close below the pennant support of $6,340 would signal a revival of the long-term bear market. Thus, the probability of BTC ending the week below $6,000 would rise sharply on pennant breakdown. That said, the sell-off is now looking overstretched on the short-duration charts, and a bearish close is looking unlikely.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart is hovering at its lowest level since June 11, signaling extreme oversold conditions. A similar sentiment is being echoed by the hourly chart RSI. Hence, a minor corrective rally cannot be ruled out. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" The list of indicators signaling a long-term bullish reversal in bitcoin (BTC) continues to grow with each passing week. The latest to join the list is the MACD histogram, which has moved above zero – turned bullish – for the first time since January. The MACD, which oscillates above and below the zero line, is one of the most popular technical indicators used to determine a trend’s reversal and momentum. A bearish-to-bullish trend change is confirmed when the histogram moves above the zero line. On the other hand, a bearish reversal is confirmed when it dips below zero. The bullish turn of the MACD adds credence to BTC’s strong defense of the psychological support of $6,000 in the last 10 weeks. Further, it validates bearish exhaustion indicated by BTC’s long-tailed monthly candle and the record low net shorts in the BTC futures market. At press time, BTC is trading at $7,320 on Bitfinex, representing a 0.8 percent appreciation on a 24-hour basis.  As seen in the chart above, the histogram has moved above the zero line for the first time since January. More importantly, the bullish turn in the MACD is accompanied by a falling channel breakout (bullish pattern). So, it seems safe to say that the outlook as per the weekly chart is bullish. As a result, BTC could explore the upside towards the July highs above $8,500 in the next few weeks. While the long-term picture is looking rosy, the cryptocurrency could drop to $7,000 (psychological support) in the next day or two, if the wedge pattern seen in the chart below ends with a downside break.  The rising trendline has been breached, so BTC could dip below the wedge support of $7,230 in the next few hours. On the other hand, a high volume bullish breakout would signal a continuation of the rally from the August low of $5,859. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin (BTC) is all set to end August with double digit-losses, but a closer look at the price action suggest better times lie ahead for the leading cryptocurrency. At time of writing, BTC is trading at $6,940 – down 10.7 percent from the month’s opening price of $7,727, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. However, losses would have been much bigger had prices not recovered from the six-week lows below $5,900 seen on Aug. 14. Indeed, the bitcoin market has witnessed a solid two-way business this month. Sellers dominated the first half as the markets reacted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) disapproval of a Winklevoss bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in late July. However, by mid-August, the bears had run out of steam and the technical charts were calling for a corrective rally. Accordingly, BTC picked up a bid and moved above $6,400 in the third week. Notably, the short-term bullish reversal signals gained more credence after the cryptocurrency shrugged off the SEC’s rejection of nine other ETF proposals on Aug. 22. Further, BTC/USD short positions in the futures market hit record lows, signaling the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 set in December likely ended around the psychological support of $6,000. Consequently, the emboldened bulls pushed BTC to highs above $7,000 earlier this week. So, while BTC is reporting a 10 percent monthly loss overall, the technical charts indicate there is a reason to be optimistic going forward.  As seen in the above chart (prices as per Bitfinex), a long wick (tail) is attached to the current monthly candle, which is widely considered a sign of trend weakness – that is, the bears failed in their attempt to push prices back to the June low of $5,755 and the bulls regained some lost ground. Further, the bears have failed three times in the last 10 weeks to keep the cryptocurrency below the support at $6,000. So, it seems safe to say the cryptocurrency has likely charted a long-term bottom around $6,000 and hence prices could revisit July highs above $8,500 in the next month or two.

" Bitcoin (BTC) bulls need to defend key support at $6,905 to avoid invalidation of the short-term bullish outlook, technical charts suggest. Having hit a peak of $7,139 Wednesday, the leading cryptocurrency is currently trading around $6,920 on Bitfinex – down 2 percent on a 24-hour basis. The drop does not come as a surprise, however, as the 21 percent rally witnessed in the last two weeks was looking overstretched yesterday. More notably, the short-term bull case would weaken if BTC finds acceptance below the 100-day moving average (MA) of $6,905.  BTC created a “spinning top” candle yesterday, which, when viewed against the backdrop of the 21 percent rally from the low of $8,507, likely represents bullish exhaustion. Looking ahead, a UTC close below the 100-day MA lined up at $6,905 would validate the spinning top candle and shift risk in favor of a downside break of the rising wedge. Acceptance below the wedge support would confirm a bullish-to-bearish trend change, that is, the rally from the low of $5,859 has ended and the bigger downtrend from the July high of $8,507 has resumed. In this case, BTC could revisit recent lows below $6,000. Hence, the bulls need to defend the 100-day MA of $6,905 to keep the short-term bullish outlook intact. That may be a tough call, though, as the short duration charts are pointing to an increased risk of further losses.  As seen in the above chart, BTC has breached the rising trendline in favor of the bears. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has taken out the ascending trendline support. As a result, the emboldened bears may push the cryptocurrency down to the ascending (bullish) 50-candle MA, currently located at $6,735.

" The bearish sentiment in the bitcoin (BTC) futures market hit a record low last week, indicating that the worst of the leading cryptocurrency’s price plunge just might be in the past. The non-commercial futures contracts of bitcoin, traded by large speculators and hedge funds, totaled a net position of -1266 contracts in the week ended Aug. 21 – the lowest on record, according to the data released by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Friday. The futures data indicates that the speculators are the least bearish on BTC since the futures were first listed back in December. A negative total represents net short positions (bearish bets) and a positive tally indicates net long positions (bullish bets). The sharp drop in the bearish sentiment, as represented by the steady decline in the net short positions from the high of -1945 seen ten weeks ago to -1266, adds credence to the signs of bearish exhaustion indicated by BTC’s defense of $6,000 since mid-June. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,715 on Bitfinex.  As seen in the above chart, BTC printed lows below $6,000 three times in the last 10 weeks, but the drop was short-lived, that is, all three weekly candles closed (Sunday’s close as per UTC) above the psychological mark. So, it seems safe to say that for BTC, the path of least resistance is on the higher side. The short-term technical charts are also echoing similar sentiments.  The upward sloping 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs) indicate a short-term bullish setup. Further, the 50-day MA is about the cross the 100-day MA in a bull-friendly manner. The ascending trendline and the rising 50-candle MA and 100-candle MA favor a move higher toward $7,000. That said, BTC’s inability to cross the psychological hurdle of $6,800 over the weekend is a slight cause for concern. However, only a break below the channel support, currently seen at $6,600, would abort the short-term bullish view. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" UPDATE (20:00 UTC): Bitcoin’s trading range has now surpassed $160 for the day. The bitcoin market has gone comatose today with a key volatility reading hitting fresh yearly lows. The daily bitcoin volatility, as represented by the spread between the daily price high and price low (as per UTC), currently stands at $84 – the lowest level since July 9, 2017 – according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Back then, the spread was seen at $68. Assuming that this differential remains at $84 until 00:00 UTC hours, we can say that bitcoin’s daily volatility has hit a 13-month low Friday.  The reading is of particular importance for traders as the drop in the volatility is often a precursor to the big move in prices. For instance, the daily volatility jumped to $389 on July 10, after having hit a yearly low of $97.21 on July 8. On similar lines, the daily range spiked to $850 on June 10, after printing a low of $107 on June 7. The data gels well with technical theory, which states that the longer the period of consolidation (low volatility period), the more violent the breakout tends to be. Accordingly, we could be in for a big move in the next few days, possibly on the higher side as the technicals are biased toward the bulls and the BTC/USD shorts on Bitfinex are near record highs, meaning the cryptocurrency is vulnerable to a short covering rally. All in all, the bitcoin daily volatility has hit 13-month lows at a time when the path of least resistance for bitcoin is on the higher side. So, it seems safe to say a big bullish move is overdue. However, a break below the key support of $6,230 (Aug. 20 low) would invalidate the bullish view put forward by the technical studies.

" The probability of a bullish move in bitcoin (BTC) has gone up in the last 24 hours. To start with, the leading cryptocurrency has remained well above the key support of $6,230 (Aug. 20 low) despite the ETF rejection, adding credence to our assessment that the cryptomarkets had already priced in the bad news. Further, the decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to review the rejection of the nine bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETF) could demoralize the bears and trigger an unwinding of the short positions. It is worth noting that the BTC/USD shorts on Bitfinex are hovering near record highs seen on April 12. So, there is a real risk of a significant short covering rally.  And last but not the least, the technical chart below indicates the path of least resistance remains to the upside while BTC is holding above the crucial rising trendline. At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,550 – up 1.6 percent on a 24-hour basis, having bottomed out at $5,859 on Aug. 14.  BTC continues to create higher lows (bullish pattern) along the rising trendline. The bullish crossover between the 50-candle and 100-candle moving averages (MA) also favors further gains in BTC. Also, an extended period of consolidation often paves way for a violent move, according to the technical theory. Hence, the bullish move could be sharp, similar to the one we saw on April 12, as the Bollinger bands (standard deviation of +2, -2 on 20-candle MA) have been flatlined since Aug. 11, meaning the cryptocurrency is lacking a clear bias for close to two weeks.

" Tanzeel Akhtar is an independent British journalist whose work has been published in The Wall Street Journal, CNBC, FT Alphaville, Investing.com, Forbes, Euromoney and Citywire. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are having a hard time clearing the bar in the U.S., where nine applications were rejected by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yesterday. The SEC is now moving to review the decisions. Commissioner Hester Peirce tweeted: “In English: the Commission (Chairman and Commissioners) delegates some tasks to its staff. When the staff acts in such cases, it acts on behalf of the Commission. The Commission may review the staff’s action, as will now happen here.” If the products are ultimately approved, then the largest cryptocurrency by market value, bitcoin, would have likely seen a substantial price increase. For now, however, HODLers will have to sit tight and wait patiently with their coins shivering in cold storage a little longer. (The next major deadline is in September when VanEck and SolidX will have their joint proposal heard, though that deadline can be extended int0 2019.) In the meantime, though, that isn’t quelling speculation about how an ETF would benefit those who hold bitcoin as an investment. In a post on Medium from June, Ironwood’s Michael Strutton teases us some with his perspective on the potential of a bitcoin ETF, “If ETFs add 24 million U.S. investors, and the upward momentum adds 14 million from the rest of the world, then that adds $84 billion and $336 billion, respectively, to the market cap.” “Over the past six months, bitcoin’s market cap has swung from $326 billion to $110 billion. Adding $420 billion to the market cap could put bitcoin’s price range from $26,000 to $44,000,” he continued. The estimates, while just estimates, still showcase an underlying belief that an ETF will provide a boost for investors. Still, from yesterday’s market movements, it’s clear the opposite is true. Crypto prices are hypersensitive to government regulation and it came as no shock when prices tumbled last night as news broke that the SEC had rejected the applications. With so much capital at risk, the SEC has been fairly clear about its stance and the regulator is right to express concern about fraud and manipulation of bitcoin markets. It is important to spend an enormous amount of effort cataloguing the potential risks from all angles before approving a bitcoin ETF. However, crypto fans should not take the SEC’s decision personally. There is the need for a professional-grade market which has the liquidity and depth to support the hedging activities of a U.S.-based bitcoin ETF issuer. For perspective, it helps to take a step back and look at the U.S. ETFs market in general. Once-upon-a-time, new and exotic ETF products were always first to be launched in the U.S., with Europe and Asia propelled by the American market. After years of unbridled growth, the introduction of new ETFs have been running into hurdles as regulators within the securities industry crackdown. Still, there are tasks that the technology’s evangelists can take up in the meantime. CoinShares, chief strategy officer, Meltem Demirors, made an excellent point on CNBC in August, when she highlighted, “The narrative around bitcoin is still really hard to grasp,” she said. “Really the only metric we have for most cryptocurrencies is the price, and price is such an imperfect metric. What does actual utilization look like? That’s really the struggle for crypto right now,” Demirors added. The regulatory community has put forth a similar idea – that time is on the side of innovators. As SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce articulated in an argument in favor of a bitcoin ETF, saying: “Bitcoin is a new phenomenon, and its long-term viability is uncertain. It may succeed; it may fail.” Peirce added that she doesn’t believe the SEC to be positioned for either outcome, but that could change with time, and with more clarity as to the narrative surrounding the technology. Why do most bitcoin investors want a Bitcoin ETF? Today, the most obvious reason is so the prices rise and investors can ride the high again like in December. We can bet regulators will want to have more nuanced reasons for an approval. For now, investors need to take a step back and assess the risks involved. The SEC has been nothing but clear and the language used in each rejection is telling. Back down, sit tight and be patient. The SEC has your best interest at heart.

" Bitcoin is teasing a minor rally today, having defended key support at $6,230 despite a string of bad news. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,400 on Bitfinex – down 3 percent on a 24-hour basis. Meanwhile, 94 out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are flashing red, according to CoinMarketCap. The risk-off tone in the cryptocurrency markets is likely associated with the US Securities Exchange Commission’s (SEC) rejection of several proposals for bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Wednesday. Further, it was reported earlier today that China, one of the biggest sources of demand for cryptocurrencies, is planning to block access to more than 100 overseas crypto exchanges. Still, BTC has avoided a break below the rising trendline and is holding well above the support at $6,230 (Aug. 20 low), as seen in the chart below, forcing us to consider the possibility of a rally.  The chart also shows the 50-candle and 100-candle moving averages (MAs) are beginning to rise in favor of the bulls. So, it seems safe to say that the path of least resistance is to the upside. Only a UTC close below $6,230 would weaken the bull case. That said, the probability of a break below $6,230 is low, as the SEC ruling has not caught the market off guard – that is, the investor community was likely expecting the commission to deliver bad news after its previous ETF rejection in July. Following that, the bitcoin price crashed more than 30 percent in the three weeks to Aug. 14, indicating the market was pricing in yesterday’s negative news in advance.

" It’s an understatement to say the current price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency pales when compared to its past glories – at $6,700, bitcoin is down roughly 60 percent from its all-time high. That said, market conditions aren’t the same as they have been in years past. Indeed, bitcoin’s 2017 boom has brought new attention, and with it, traders and investors who are left wondering if the asset can ever return to its former glory.  Certainly, there’s no shortage of ways to approach the question, but one effective method is to look at the charts for historical patterns that could speak to investor psychology, and perhaps, yield valuable hints and clues about future performance.  Applying these theories, a market might be expected to “bottom,” or reach a new low, after a speculative bubble bursts in a moment often referred to as “capitulation.” Consisting of extreme selling over a short time period, the infamous 2014 bitcoin bear market finally bottomed out after it lost more than 40 percent of its value in less than three days at the top of 2015. Since such an event could be measured and understood in real-time, some eagle-eyed investors picked up on the move, even drawing attention to it on social media. That’s because, to chart addicts known as technical analysts, all known information about a particular asset is reflected in its price action. So, in order to predict bitcoin’s future, taking a look at its price history is perhaps the best place to start.  It’s an inexact science, and there’s no guarantee history will ever repeat. That said, observing the bitcoin’s past price action yields three possibilities worth of being discussed and considered. While technical analysts only take price action into account, it’s impossible to ignore the implications a bitcoin ETF could have on prices of the cryptocurrency.  As an indication of the effect an ETF can have on prices of an asset, gold prices increased drastically in the years following the introduction of an ETF. Using this as a measure, it’s valid to assume bitcoin would succumb to a similar and explosive fate.  With several ETF proposals awaiting a decision, most importantly the VanEck-SolidX ETF on September 30, a trader must account for any possible outcome. The market is already overwhelmingly bearish, so the true devil’s advocate would play contrarian and account for the ETF’s trend-changing approval.  As shown in the above chart, ascending trend lines of support have played an important role throughout the history of bitcoin prices.  The first trendline took effect in 2012 when it provided reliable support for a strong uptrend from $2-$16. After surpassing $16, price action went completely parabolic, straying away from trendline until making a return at the end of 2014.  This time however, price broke through the support and immediate capitulation took place, selling off more than 40 percent of bitcoin’s price in three days.  Since the infamous capitulation and 2015 market bottom, price found a new ascending support (lower white line) that will look to once again come into play sooner than later.  The devil’s advocate claims “we’ve seen the worst” of the 2018 bear market, so he is expecting a bounce on or before the fast approaching trendline. The argument has merit, as several bitcoin ETF proposals will be decided upon in the next few weeks and an approval could be just enough to salvage the trend, avoiding large-scale capitulation entirely.  If there’s no bitcoin ETF approval, one could argue there’s no reason for bitcoin to resume its bullish uptrend until a market bottom occurs like it did in 2014-2015.  Here lies the second bear market ending scenario.  Looking at how dramatically price reacted to a breach of its first long-term ascending support in the chart, it’s reasonable to assume it would have a similar reaction if the current trendline breaks (middle white line). If this does occur, there are two locations that present optimal bottoms following substantial capitulation. The first “bottom zone” lies in the $5,000 area since it was the peak resistance level of the prior bull move, from $3,000 to $5,000.  Support and resistance lines experience an effect known as “polarity” when they are surpassed. When this occurs, resistance converts into support and vice versa because the party holding up or down prices has finally given up, which shifts control to the opposing party.  It’s important to note the $5,000 area has yet to be truly tested as support since it was initially breached as resistance. This suggests a test of the level as support is likely and elects it as a potential candidate for the market bottom. However, capitulation from current levels would not be overly severe for the $5,000 level to hold, perhaps leaving some to believe the market needs more extreme sell-offs in order to find a true bottom. That is where the next potential “bottom zone” of ~$3,000 could come into play.  Technically speaking, the $3,000 level is much stronger support than $5,000. Similar to the above zone, $3,000 marked the peak resistance of a prior bull move, except after this resistance broke, the same level was sufficiently tested and proved as support. What’s more, the $3,000 bottom zone would represent an 85 percent deprecation from bitcoin’s all-time high, a near identical peak-to-bottom percent difference as the 2014 bear market of 86.65 percent, according to figures from the Bitstamp exchange.  Perhaps here lies another devil’s advocate, the ultra-bearish contrarian.  Upon a close examination of the price level (~$240) where the first ascending support trend line was breached in Jan. 2015, it coincidentally also marks the exact peak of the prior “mega” bull run when price surged nearly 1,000 percent from $16 to $240.  In a sense, breaking both the trend line and prior bull run high was a “double whammy” to investors giving them no other choice than to lose complete hope, the necessary precursor to capitulation.  According to this theory, if the current ascending trend line breaks, price may not find its “bottom” until reaching the high of the prior “mega” bull run, which in this case lies in the $1,200 area.  If prices were to fall to this level, it’s last hope would be to eventually find a new ascending support for the entire “bull cycle” to repeat, an estimated outcome depicted by the dashed white line in the chart.

" The number of short orders placed on bitcoin is less than 3 percent – or 1,196 orders – away from setting a new all-time high, according to data from cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. As of 16:00 UTC Tuesday, there are 39,524 short orders outstanding, marking its highest level in more than four months. Shorts have only been higher on one occasion: April 12, when the figure reached 40,719 orders.  Bitcoin shorts of this amount speaks volumes about the prevailing market sentiment being overwhelmingly bearish, given that investors continue to bet that the price of the cryptocurrency will sink further in the near term.  There is cause to caution the bears, however. Since more than 16,000 shorts were opened at a bitcoin price below $6,700 (Aug. 8th through today), a less than 4.5 percent increase in bitcoin’s current price of roughly $6,435 could cause a significant portion of the total shorts to cover, or have to buy BTC back in order to close their losing position. Such an occurrence can cause prices to quickly rise even further due to the increase in buy orders, an effect known as a “short squeeze.” A short squeeze of this nature is not without merit as a near-identical situation came to fruition on April 12, the same day shorts reached an all-time high. On that day, bitcoin opened at a price of $6,943 but ultimately reached a 24-hour high of $8,087 as a result of a significant amount of short orders needing to be closed.  As seen in the above chart, circumstances between April 12 and today are very similar. On both occasions, price traveled sideways in the mid-$6,000 range following a steep downswing in prices. This allowed for the emboldened bears to put up an abundance of short orders on Bitfinex, depicted by the red line indicator. What’s more, the relative strength index (RSI), an indicator used to identify “overbought” or “oversold” market conditions, is printing a near identical daily value (~44) as on April 12th.  Indeed, the stage is set for a massive short squeeze, but there is no guarantee bitcoin prices will rise enough to force those shorting to close their positions.  Until then, both bears and bulls are waiting eagerly and watching as the events unfold.  Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.

" History often has a way of repeating itself. The current price pattern in the bitcoin market is eerily similar to the one observed in the run-up to a major rally that occurred on April 12. To start with, bitcoin charted a long-tailed candle on Aug. 14, similar to the one seen on Apr. 1, signaling the sell-off from the July 24 high of $8,507 has likely run its course. Further, the leading cryptocurrency has spent the last seven days trading in a sideways manner around $6,400. Back in April, the cryptocurrency traded around $6,800 in the first 11 days before rising sharply above $8,000 on April 12. More importantly, during the bitcoin price consolidation of early April, the BTC/USD shorts on Bitfinex jumped more than 44 percent to print a record high of 40,719 and fell sharply on April 12, meaning the big spike in BTC was likely fueled by the unwinding of short positions. Interestingly, the short positions on Bitfinex currently stand at $38,640 – the highest level April 12 – and are just short of the record high of 40,719, as seen in the chart below.   As seen in the daily chart above, BTC looks to be repeating the price action seen in early April. Even the relative strength index (RSI) is positioned exactly where it was ahead of April 12. So, the question now is will bitcoin repeat the history by producing a $1,000 rally in the next few days? In theory, a sharp rise in short positions during price consolidation is considered a sign the market is preparing for another round of sell-off. However, in BTC’s case, the consolidation is happening after a 30 percent drop, meaning the cryptocurrency is oversold. Add to that the extreme bearish positioning, as indicated by the near record high BTC/USD shorts, and there is always a risk of a short covering rally. So, it seems safe to say history will likely repeat itself. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin (BTC) is stuck in a narrowing price range and the direction of the next breakout is far from certain. The leading cryptocurrency was expected to rise toward $7,000 over the weekend, having moved past a key technical hurdle on Friday. However, contrary to expectations, BTC failed to absorb supply around $6,600 in the last 48 hours.  Even so, the rejection at $6,600 has not proved costly, and BTC’s bears have struggled to bring the cryptocurrency below the psychological support of $6,300. BTC is now being squeezed into a tight $300 trading range and is changing hands at $6,400 on Bitfinex at press time – up 0.80 percent on a 24-hour basis.  As seen in the chart above, BTC has created a narrowing price range, popularly known as a pennant pattern, over the last five days.  As of writing, the pennant resistance (top end) is located at $6,595 and the support (lower end) is seen at $6,320.  A bullish breakout would be confirmed if the 4-hour candle closes above $6,595. That would add credence to the bullish relative strength index divergence (RSI) and a beach of a key falling trendline witnessed earlier this month and would open the doors to a stronger rally towards $7,000 (psychological hurdle).  However, the bears could feel emboldened if the 4-hour candle closes below $6,320. In this case, BTC could drop below $6,000 (February low). It’s worth noting that a downside break of the pennant would push the RSI below the rising channel support and that would only validate the bearish price pattern.   Over on the daily chart, a bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs) indicates the path of least resistance is to the upside.  That said, the overall bias as per the daily chart remains bearish as long as the cryptocurrency is trading below the ascending trendline drawn from the June 29 low and July 12 low. At press time, both the rising trendline and 100-day MA are located at $7,067.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" For bitcoin (BTC), the path of least resistance is to the upside, according to technical charts. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,430 on Bitfinex – up 9 percent from the Aug. 14 low of $5,859. However, BTC has failed three times in the last 72 hours to hold on to gains above $6,500, with the latest attempt to scale the psychological level failing a couple of minutes before press time. This may force investors to question the sustainability of the recent rally. But such concerns may be unfounded, as the bullish bias has only strengthened in the last 24 hours, as seen in the technical charts below. As a result, BTC could rise toward $7,000 (psychological resistance) over the weekend. BTC scaled the channel resistance (top end) earlier today, confirming a bullish breakout, that is, the sell-off from the July 25 high of $8,507 has ended and the bulls have regained control. A closer look at the chart reveals the top end of the channel has been playing a spoilsport since Wednesday. Hence, it seems safe to say the bulls are feeling emboldened, having crossed a key hurdle. The cryptocurrency has also found acceptance above the 50-candle moving average (MA) and looks set to test the 100-candle MA, currently located at $6,725.  The relative strength index has witnessed a bull flag breakout – a bullish continuation pattern – which indicates BTC could soon pick up a strong bid and jump to the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline of $6,715. Acceptance above that level would open the doors to $7,500 (target as per the measured height method).  The 5-day MA is beginning to rise in a bull-friendly manner and has almost crossed the 10-day MA from below (bullish crossover). This change of direction by the 5-day and 10-day MA points to a short-term bullish setup. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin is showing signs of life, but only a break above key resistance at $6,675 would confirm a bullish reversal, technical charts indicate. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,470 on Bitfinex – up 10 percent from the 6.5-week low of $5,859 hit on Aug. 14. However, the break below the key support of $6,000 (February low) was short-lived and prices moved back above $6,100 by UTC close, signaling bearish exhaustion. More importantly, the follow-through has been positive: BTC crossed Tuesday’s high of $6,259 and jumped to $6,649 yesterday, confirming that sellers have likely run dry and bargain hunters are finding the current price too attractive to pass up. Hence, it seems safe to say that a bullish trend reversal is in progress and would be confirmed if prices take out the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance of $6,675, as seen in the chart below. BTC is creating the right shoulder of a inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern on the hourly chart. A move above $6,675 would confirm the sell-off from the July high of $8,507 has ended and would open the doors to $7,490 (target as per the measured height method). That said, the daily and the 4-hour charts show that BTC could attempt a break above $6,675 in the next 24 hours.  As seen in the chart above, the cryptocurrency has pierced the descending trendline, meaning the sell-off from the high of $8,507 has ended. The relative strength index (RSI) has also adopted a bullish bias (above 50.00).  BTC created a bullish inverted hammer candle yesterday, adding credence to Tuesday’s long-tailed (bear exhaustion) candle and confirming the cryptocurrency has likely bottomed out at $5,859.

" The cryptocurrency market is flashing green Wednesday following a major downturn, with the total capitalization rising more than $11 billion on a 24-hour basis. The signs of a turnaround emerge in the wake of a rough patch for the market, during which it hit its lowest point for 2018, as CoinDesk previously reported. At press time, bitcoin, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is trading hands at an average of $6,349 – a considerable improvement from yesterday, when the price hit a low of $5,921.65, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Bitcoin hit a high of $6,612.73 during Wednesday’s session, BPI data shows.    A turnaround for the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH) is perhaps most notable given the severity of its recent market free fall. The price of ETH fell from $407 on August 7th to a low of $257 yesterday – a more than 36 percent week-to-week depreciation, according to CoinDesk’s Ether Price Index (EPI). Ether’s plummet made it next to impossible for many cryptocurrencies to show positive growth in BTC value. Sellers of the cryptocurrency have since taken a breather, allowing for a more than 12 percent relief rally in price to occur (by press-time prices). The EPI is reporting a price of roughly $289 at time of writing. The rest of the market immediately followed suit, bringing the total market capitalization at one point back above the $212 billion mark from a more than eight-month low. As of the time of writing, that figure is hovering around $205 billion.  All of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are currently reporting 24-hour gains above 4 percent with the exception of stellar lumens. What’s more, ETH, XRP, Monero, and EOS are all posting gains of above 8 percent, with ETH leading the pack for price growth in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.

" Down two-thirds from its December all-time high of $20,000, bitcoin (BTC) now risks printing fresh 2018 lows below $5,755. The corrective rally seen over the weekend failed to penetrate the key rising trendline hurdle of $6,480 on Monday, allowing the bears to make a strong comeback. As a result, the leading cryptocurrency fell below $6,000 (February low) and extended the slide to $5,859 earlier today – the lowest level since June 29 – according to Bitfinex data. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,032 – down 6 percent in the last 24 hours. Despite sharp losses, bitcoin is the fourth best-performing cryptocurrency among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap. Other cryptocurrencies are reporting bigger losses. For instance, 92 out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have suffered double-digit losses on a 24-hour basis. Further, the bitcoin dominance rate, a measure of BTC’s market share, jumped to an eight-month high of 53.7 percent today. Hence, it seems safe to say that the cryptocurrency markets have turned risk-averse, that is, investors are venturing out of the high-risk alternative cryptocurrencies and into well-established cryptocurrencies like BTC, and then possibly on to fiat currency. Looking ahead, the downtrend in bitcoin prices could continue as the technical chart analysis is calling a deeper sell-off – although support at $5,650 could hold for now.  The bears are likely to be feeling emboldened following the bull failure at the descending trendline hurdle despite the bullish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) seen in the chart above. More importantly, the bullish RSI divergence has been invalidated (prices dropped below $6,000) within three days of confirmation, which indicates the bearish sentiment is quite strong. What’s more, the major moving averages (50-candle, 100-candle, and 200-candle) continue to trend south in favor of the bears. Thus, BTC could hit fresh yearly lows below $5,755 (June low) this week.  As the above chart shows, BTC could encounter support around $5,650 (trendline drawn from the February low of $6,000 and the June low of $5,755). BTC may, however, defend support at $5,650 in the short-term, as the cryptocurrency is looking oversold, having dropped more than 40 percent over the last three weeks. If the support at $5,650 is breached, though, then the lower end of the falling channel, currently located at $5,340, could come into play.

" The price of bitcoin fell below $6,000 on Tuesday, a move that brought the world’s largest cryptocurrency within 2 percent of its 2018 low.  At press time, bitcoin is trading hands at $5,922, printing a 5 percent 24-hour depreciation, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, up slightly from a low of $5,785 set June 24.  Bitcoin is not alone in the sinking ship, however, as the broader market continues to suffer.  At press time, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is below $200 billion, its lowest figure yet seen in 2018. What’s more, many of the other big name cryptocurrencies already set their lowest prices of the year this past week.  Ether (ETH), the cryptocurrency that powers the ethereum blockchain is trading hands at $264 – its lowest price since November 2017. Likewise, The XRP price has fallen below $0.30, its lowest price of the year and a more than 90 percent depreciation from it’s all-time high over $3 set in December.

" Falling prices have sent the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies back below $200 billion. Data from CoinMarketCap shows the total market cap slid to $189 billion on Tuesday, a move that follows successive days of market declines. The market cap first rose above $200 billion in November 2017, a development spurred at the time by the listing of bitcoin futures products. Leading the downward push is zilliqa, which has seen the value of its ZIL cryptocurrency fall by 35 percent in the past 24 hours.  The decline is accompanied by continued growth in the so-called bitcoin dominance rate, or the percentage of the total market cap that is contributed by the world’s largest cryptocurrency. As CoinDesk reported on August 11, the dominance rate rose above 50 percent for the first time in 2018. At press time, that figure is being reported as 54 percent, it’s highest annual total.

" Bitcoin (BTC) jumped to seven-month highs against Turkey’s national currency, the lira (TRY), on Monday. The price spike comes after the U.S. imposed sanctions against Turkey on Friday for continuing to hold an American pastor in custody. The resultant economic shock-wave has seen the lira drop to a new lifetime low of 7.20 TRY against the U.S. dollar today, after already having dropped 27 percent last week. On a year-to-date basis, the lira is down more than 80 percent against the greenback. The crash in the lira looks very likely to be increasing bitcoin’s proposition as a safe-haven asset in Turkey, and the price of the cryptocurrency shot up to 47,192 TRY earlier today – the highest level since January 21, according to Bitfinex data. At press time, the figure had dropped slightly to around 44,000 TRY. Since August 8, BTC has appreciated against the lira by 31 percent and is also up by 67 percent from the June 24 low of 26,337 TRY. By comparison, the cryptocurrency’s U.S. dollar-denominated exchange rate is up just 12 percent from its low of $5,755 seen on June 24.  So what’s behind the sudden appeal of bitcoin for Turkish investors? The sharp slide in the lira has already pushed up inflation, which, along with a slump in spending power for TRY holders, has certainly boosted bitcoin’s appeal as a store of value. The increased interest is evident from the fact that Turkish cryptocurrency exchanges Paribu, Btcturk, and Koinim have witnessed a spike in trading volumes since Friday. As of writing, Paribu is reporting a 100 percent rise in trading volumes for the BTC/TRY trading pair. Looking forward, BTC could well rise further against the lira, as Turkey’s President Erdogan continues to oppose interest rate hikes to stabilize the currency and, rather than backing down, has referred to the President Trump’s decision to impose sanctions on Turkish steel and aluminum as an “attack“ on its economy.

" Against expectations, bitcoin (BTC) defended support at $6,000 over the weekend, opening the doors for a stronger corrective rally above $6,480. Friday’s drop below $6,240 (bear flag breakdown) had created room for a drop to the June low of $5,755. Further, BTC closed below Thursday’s low of $6,183 on Friday, signaling a continuation of the sell-off from the July 25 high of $8,507. However, while the odds were stacked in favor of the bears, a break below $6,000 did not materialize. But it was close: the leading cryptocurrency printed a six-week low of $6,008 on Saturday, before rising to $6,500. At press time, price had moved a little lower to $6,450. Looking ahead, the corrective rally could be extended further towards $6,850 if the bulls can overcome solid-looking resistance at $6,480, as seen in the chart below.  On the 4-hour chart, BTC is currently working hard to scale the trendline hurdle of $6,480. A convincing break above that key resistance level would validate the bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by a bullish relative strength index (RSI) divergence over the weekend, and could be a springboard on to a stronger rally toward $6,850. That could still be a tough task, though, as the downward sloping (bearish) 50-candle moving average (MA) is currently located at $6,580, while the 100-candle MA is soon set to cross the 200-candle MA from above in favor of the bears. As a result, a repeated failure to take out trendline resistance could shift focus back to bearish MAs and weaken the bull case. BTC created an inverse head-and-shoulders-like pattern on the hourly chart over the weekend and cleared the neckline hurdle earlier today, adding credence to the bullish RSI divergence seen in the 4-hour chart. The bullish breakout has opened up upside toward $6,850 (target as per the measured height method). Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" It takes two to tango in the world of crypto trading, where a dynamic relationship between buyers and sellers is always on display in something called an order book. A tool that visualizes a real-time list of outstanding orders for a particular asset, order books represent the interests of buyers and sellers, offering a window into supply and demand. But while all order books serve the same purpose, their appearance can differ slightly among exchanges. That said, they are all built with the same features and functions. Examples from Coinbase Pro, Binance, Bitfinex and Kraken are shown below:  To become comfortable reading order books, it is essential to understand four main concepts: bid, ask, amount and price. This information is displayed on two sides of the order book known as the buy-side and sell-side. For the purposes of this explanation, we will be using the BTC/USD order book from one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Bitfinex. Although the two sides display opposing information, the concepts of amount (also referred to as size) and price are relevant to both. Simply put, the amount and price per order display the total units of the cryptocurrency looking to be traded and at what price each unit is valued. In the example below there is an open buy order in the amount of 20.24 at a price of $8218.50.  This means the entity who opened this order would like to purchase 20.24 units of bitcoin at a price of $8,218.50 per unit. In the Bitfinex order book, you will also see the terms “count” and “total.” The count refers to how many orders are combined at this price level to create the amount, whereas the total is simply a running total of the combined amounts. The buy side represents all open buy orders below the last traded price. This offer from the buyer is known as the “bid.” It effectively voices the trader’s interest, stating something like, “I am bidding on X units you own at a specific price in the hopes of purchasing them.” Once the bid is matched with an appropriate sell order, the trade can be facilitated. When there is an abundance of buy orders (demand) at a specific price level, something known as a buy wall is formed. Buy walls have an effect on the price of an asset because if the large order cannot be filled, neither can buy orders at a lower bid. The price will not be able to sink any further since the orders below the wall cannot be executed until the large order is fulfilled – in turn helping the wall act as a short-term support level.  In the example above, we can see a large order of 500.2 BTC units waiting to be filled with a bid of $6,263. Since the order is rather large (high demand) compared to what is being offered (low supply), the orders at a lower bid cannot be filled until this order is satisfied – creating a buy wall. In this case, the buy wall is helping the $6,263 price level of bitcoin act as short-term support. Conversely, the sell side contains all open sell orders above the last traded price. This price is known as the “ask.” It states, “I am asking someone to buy X units I own at a certain price.” The opposite of a buy wall is formed when there is an abundance of sell orders (supply) at a specific price level, known as a sell wall. If there is a very large sell order unlikely to be filled due to lack of demand at the specified price level, then sell orders at a higher price cannot be executed – therefore making the price level of the wall a short-term resistance. All in all, the order book gives a trader an opportunity to make more informed decisions based on the buy and sell interest of a particular cryptocurrency. Essentially, it provides a “behind the scenes” view into live-action supply and demand which may reveal order imbalances, market manipulation and support/resistance zones – all of which can be used to a savvy trader’s advantage.

" Bitcoin (BTC) now makes up 50 percent of the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization. Shortly past 03:00 UTC on August 11, CoinMarketCap’s bitcoin dominance rate – an indicator that tracks the percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization contributed by the leading cryptocurrency – reached 50 percent for the first time since December 19th, 2017. At press time, bitcoin’s market capitalization now records $105,785,552,545, which is about $901 million more than the market capitalization of every other cryptocurrency combined. Chart via CoinMarketCap The above chart shows bitcoin’s dominance rate has been on a steady incline over the past few months, currently representing a 14 percent increase from May 1st. In the same time period the market dominance of all other cryptocurrencies have largely been on the decline. Conditions were much different the last time bitcoin’s market dominance was above 50 percent. On Dec. 19th, the average price of BTC was $17,605.81 across exchanges – an 65 percent higher price than the cryptocurrency’s value today, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) close today will likely decide the short-term trend in prices. The leading cryptocurrency snapped a three-day losing streak on Thursday as the 26 percent sell-off witnessed in the last three weeks was looking overstretched. What’s more important is that BTC traded yesterday within the high and low range of the previous day, indicating the bears have likely run out of steam and the bulls are still reluctant to enter the market at these levels. It seems safe to say that the bitcoin market has become indecisive in the last 24 hours. However, a stronger corrective rally could be seen over the weekend if prices find acceptance above the previous day’s high of $6,628, though it won’t be an easy task. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $6,350 on Bitfinex – down 4 percent from the highs seen yesterday. As seen in the above chart, BTC created an inside-day candle yesterday, signaling indecision among both bulls and the bears. A close (as per UTC) above $6,628 (previous day’s high) would confirm a short-term bear-to-bull trend change. On the other hand, if prices close today below $6,183 (Thursday’s low), then BTC could resume the sell-off toward the June low of $5,755. As of now, this scenario appears more likely as the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MA) are steeply sloping south, indicating strong bearish pressure.  As the above chart shows, BTC has created a bear flag – a bearish continuation pattern – which indicates the sell-off from the high of $7,130 (pole high) would resume if prices take out the flag support (lower end) of $6,240. A bear flag breakdown, if confirmed, would open the doors to $5,240 (target as per the measured height method), although the target looks far-fetched as of now. That said, it could easily yield a drop to the June low of $5,755. The relative strength index (RSI) has breached the rising trendline in favor of the bears. Hence, the probability of BTC witnessing a bear flag breakdown in the next few hours is high. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" The crypto markets are seeing red in a big way Wednesday as an ongoing rout is wiping away billions of dollars in value. As reported by CoinDesk, the collective market capitalization for all crypto assets hit a new low for the year earlier today – as it stands, the overall market cap is roughly $225 billion, representing a significant decline from the more than $800 billion witnessed in early January of this year. Among the developments driving the market turmoil: the fact that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided to punt a decision on a proposed bitcoin exchange-traded fund. As always, the devil is in the details – and these four statistics show a market in turmoil According to figures compiled by CoinDesk, as much as $51 billion in market cap was lost during the past seven days. CoinMarketCap figures indicate that as much as $30 billion or more in value was shed amid the day’s market action. This amount indicates a more than 18 percent decline within that time frame.  But the market capitalization data only tells part of the story. Perhaps most tellingly, all of the top 20 cryptocurrencies (indicated on sites like CoinMarketCap as well as OnChainFX), showed significant declines in the past 24 hours, accounting for an average loss of more than 14 percent during that period. Source: OnChainFX.com For bitcoin specifically, the past days haven’t been exactly forgiving either. The cryptocurrency has seen losses for ten out of the last eleven days – a series of events that have not occurred since September 2014. That extended period of price declines is fully on display in the graph below, pulled from Bitfinex, which shows the market sliding downward after climbing above $8,000 last month.  But the 11-day datapoint has another message: the recent bull run has basically evaporated, CoinDesk analysis shows. Today’s low represents a depreciation of 26.28 percent endured over the bearish stint. As a result, over 80 percent of the recent rally from bitcoin’s annual low has evaporated. In sum, bitcoin’s price rallied $2,705 from June 24th to July 24th, over $2,000 of which has since disappeared, according to data from Bitfinex.

" The total market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies just fell to its lowest point in 2018. The developments come after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed a decision on a proposed bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The news triggered a market reaction, ultimately sending the total value of all cryptocurrencies down to $227.8 billion on Wednesday – the lowest level since November 2017 – according to data from CoinMarketCap.  The drop to nine-month lows marks a 10.7 percent depreciation on a 24-hour basis. As of press time, the market capitalization had risen back slightly to $228.6 billion. Although the ETF decision is solely in regards to bitcoin, many alternative cryptocurrencies are printing worse losses than the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, signaling worsening risk sentiment in the market.  The rise in the bitcoin dominance rate – an indicator that tracks the percent of the total crypto market capitalization contributed by the leading cryptocurrency – to an eight-month high of 48.6 percent also suggests the investors are venturing out of alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin, and then possibly on to fiat currency.  The falling spread or difference between the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin and BTC’s market capitalization is also signaling reduced demand for high-risk alternative cryptocurrencies.  At press time, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding bitcoin is just over $118 billion – an 8.5 month low – whereas the total market cap of bitcoin is topping $111 billion, a figure last seen less than a month ago and above its annual low of $99,915,112,929, according to CoinMarketCap.  Meanwhile, the BTC dominance rate is hovering around 48.9 percent and could rise to 50 percent if the risk aversion worsens, boosting demand for well-established cryptocurrencies like BTC.

" Bitcoin’s recent downtrend has deepened in the wake of a decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to delay a ruling on a keenly awaited bitcoin ETF. The leading cryptocurrency was expected to stage a minor corrective rally in the last 24 hours, having defended the key 50-day moving average (MA) support earlier this week. However, the sellers made a strong comeback above $7,100 after the SEC exercised its right to postpone the decision on whether to approve a rule that would allow Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) to offer shares of a bitcoin ETF issued by VanExk SolidX Bitcoin Trust. As a result, BTC closed (as per UTC) yesterday on a negative note at $6,719 and fell to $6,360 today – the lowest level since July 16. At press time, BTC is trading at $6,500 on Bitfinex. The 7.9 percent sell-off witnessed in the last 24 hours reinforces the view that a major part of the rally seen in July was likely fueled by speculation that a Bitcoin ETF could be approved by the US SEC within weeks. Further, the bear grip around bitcoin has strengthened in the last 24 hours as bitcoin’s drop to three-week lows below $6,400 means the cryptocurrency has retraced more than 70 percent of July’s rally to $8,507. Still, as the SEC has merely delayed its decision until September, there is still a chance that the ETF could be approved next month.  BTC’s break below the ascending trendline (drawn from the June 29 low and the July 12 low) has bolstered the already bearish technical setup. For example, the 5-day and 10-day MAs are sloping south in favor of the bears, and BTC is trading well below the long-term MAs (50-day, 100-day, and 200-day) – all suggesting the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, perhaps, the relative strength index (RSI) is holding below 50.00 (in bearish territory), but has yet to hit oversold territory (below 30.00). Hence, there is scope for a further drop towards $6,000, albeit after a minor bout of consolidation as the short-duration technical charts (below) are reporting oversold conditions.  On the 4-hour chart, the RSI has dropped below 30.00, signaling the sell-off is overdone. As a result, BTC could trade sideways within a falling channel over the next day or two.

" The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed a decision on a proposed bitcoin ETF, pushing its final determination ahead by more than a month. In an order published on August 7, officials at the agency wrote that they were giving themselves more time to deliberate on whether to approve what would be the first exchange-traded product of its kind in the U.S. It’s also perhaps unsurprising, given that in the past, SEC officials have used the agency’s statutory powers to push back decisions on bitcoin ETFs. As the agency wrote: “Accordingly, the Commission … designates September 30, 2018, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change.” The proposed rule change from CBOE would, if approved, constitute a critical point on a path to listing a bitcoin ETF, in conjunction with money management firm VanEck and crypto startup SolidX. The companies submitted their proposal back in June, setting off a busy comment period that saw the crypto community rally in support. All told, more than 100 comments were submitted through mid-July. The choice to punt forward a final decision also comes days after SEC commissioners completed a review on a proposed bitcoin ETF from investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, whose multi-year effort was dashed after a majority of the SEC’s commissioners backed up the agency’s original March 2017 rejection. One commissioner, Hester Peirce, dissented from that decision, later telling CoinDesk in an interview that the move to block a bitcoin ETF is a disservice to both investors and innovators. As of press time, the price of bitcoin has not reacted, trading at around $7,060 according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).

" Bitcoin looks primed for a minor rally, having defended a key moving average support in the last 72 hours. The 50-day moving average (MA), one of the most widely tracked technical indicators, was put to test in the previous two trading days. However, on both occasions, prices failed to penetrate the MA support by the daily close (as per UTC), signaling bearish exhaustion. Today, BTC is following a similar pattern. The leading cryptocurrency picked up a bid around the 50-day MA support of $6,938 earlier today and rose back above $7,000, raising prospects of a corrective rally. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $7,050 on Bitfinex – up 0.70 percent on a 24-hour basis. The solid defense of the 50-day MA support and the early signs of bullish reversal, as seen in the short-duration chart below, indicate scope for a stronger rally toward $7,400.  The above chart shows, the current 4-hour candle is hovering above the top end (resistance) of the falling channel (bearish pattern). A bullish breakout would be confirmed if the candle closes above the falling channel hurdle. In this case, BTC will likely rise toward the downward sloping (bearish) 100-candle MA, currently located at $7,438. This scenario appears likely as a bullish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) signals that the tide has turned in favor of a rally.  BTC created a bearish outside-day candle yesterday, meaning the day began with optimism and ended with pessimism. Still, BTC’s strong showing today backs up indications of bearish exhaustion seen yesterday. While there is a reason to be optimistic, the bulls can’t afford to lower their guard as the 5-day MA and 10-day MAs are still biased toward the bears. If prices close today (as per UTC) below $6,847 (low of the previous day’s bearish outside-day candle), the sell-off from the July high of $8,507 would resume, sending BTC below the rising trendline.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is trading in an indecisive manner after hitting 19-day lows below $6,900 on Sunday, but could pick up a bid on acceptance above $7,100, technical studies indicate. The leading cryptocurrency fell to $6,890 on Bitfinex yesterday – its lowest level since July 17 – before ending the day (as per UTC) on a flat note at $7,025. The price action indicates BTC lacks clear bias, but could also be considered a sign of bearish exhaustion, as the prices have already made a 21 percent slide from the recent high of $8,507. If the bulls are able to push prices above Sunday’s high of $7,090, then a minor corrective rally could be in the offing. On the other hand, a slide below the previous day’s low of $6,890 would revive the bearish view. At press time, BTC is trading at $6,975 – down 0.80 percent on a 24-hour basis.  The above chart shows, BTC created a doji candle (marking indecision) on Sunday at the 50-day moving average (MA) support, making today’s close (as per UTC) pivotal. A bull doji reversal would be confirmed if BTC closes today (as per UTC) above $7,090 (Sunday’s doji candle high). In this case, a corrective rally to the 100-day MA, currently located at $7,474, could be seen. Meanwhile, a close (as per UTC) below $6,890 (Sunday’s doji candle low) would signal a continuation of the sell-off from the July high of $8,507. If the bulls fail to force a rally soon, the focus would quickly shift back to the bearish factors: downward sloping 5-day and 10-day MAs, the breach of the key support of 100-day MA last week and a bearish relative strength index (RSI). Further, BTC’s close proximity to the all-important inverse head-and-shoulders neckline support (former resistance) of $6,820 is another big reason why the bulls need to make a quick comeback. A move below $6,820 would invalidate the bearish-to-bullish trend change confirmed by the inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on July 17 and would shift risk in favor of a drop below the rising trendline (yellow dotted line).  As seen on the above chart, the long-term bullish view has been invalidated by BTC’s close at $7,025 yesterday. BTC closed above the falling channel resistance in the previous week, *seeming to confirm* a long-run bearish-to-bullish trend change.  However, the breakout ended up being a bull trap [comma] as the cryptocurrency fell back inside the channel last week, invalidating the long-term bullish outlook Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Tuur Demeester is an economist and investor.  The following article references an opinion and is for information purposes only. It is not intended to be investment advice. Seek a duly licensed professional for that. Despite an already six month cool-off period, for 2018 we see more sideways and downside potential in the bitcoin price due to sluggish retail demand, hesitation from institutions and a current market cap that seems too high relative to the activity occurring on available blockchains. Many investors and advisors are on record stating that $5,700 was the bottom in bitcoin for this year, and that higher prices lie ahead. While we are very bullish on bitcoin’s long-term prospects, we do heed caution for more short-term price optimism. To find the starting point of the historic parabolic rally in bitcoin that ended at $20,000 we have to go as far back as August 2015, when bitcoin traded at below $200. This past rally was a stupendous, historic move. Even in secular bull markets, the collective of economic actors need time to absorb the information embedded in its characteristic high volume rallies. As I’ve indicated in my 2018 outlook, I think chances are high for this year to be remembered as a shakeout year: a lemon market in altcoins, regulators catching up and infrastructure growing pains. Since January, the bitcoin mining hashrate (aggregate computations per second made to secure the network ) has tripled, which means that a huge amount of new or more efficient mining rigs have come online. In combination with declining prices, this means that miners who weren’t able to upgrade their machines or find cheaper electricity have been faced with a steep decline in profitability, a 90% drop in 7 months (altcoins have faced similar or steeper declines). With profit margins under heavy pressure, it’s not unlikely that miners are and will stay responsible for a significant amount of selling in the market.  Next, trading volumes are not dead, but still below those seen during last winter and spring. It’s unclear how much of the recent pick-up in volumes are the result of a short squeeze and how much is coming from new long-term buyers coming in. After last year’s FOMO, retail interest in bitcoin has now become very sluggish:  Next, here are some comments we’ve gathered from bitcoin analysts, market makers and Wall Street insiders: The first bitcoin ETF will likely not be approved before 2019. So any anticipation of approval by September will likely be met with disappointment. While institutional investors are certainly getting involved in bitcoin, the vast majority of the firms are trading firms who are looking to make markets regardless of price: they’re just as happy to take on short positions as they are to go long. Institutions who are known to be long-biased, such as mutual funds and pension funds are not ready to invest because they’re not yet comfortable with the available custody solutions. There’s also the NVM Ratio, which is designed to reflect early stage adoption, now suggesting that there’s now too little on-chain activity to justify bitcoin’s current market cap:  The assumption here is that bitcoin’s market value is mostly derived from it being a network that connects users around the world: the more people and entities use the bitcoin blockchain to settle transactions, the more it acquires the liquidity and utility that we’d expect from digital gold. The NVM ratio approximates that by measuring daily active addresses on the blockchain. Similar valuation models have been made for growth companies such as Facebook and Linkedin, where the number of monthly active users reasonably correlates with enterprise value. (There are several objections one could raise against the NVM Ratio: it doesn’t take into account transaction amounts nor the difference between old an new addresses, it doesn’t discount spam attacks, it doesn’t acknowledge limitations to the block size and neither does it consider institutions coming into the market who build derivatives on bitcoin that rely on a small amount of high-value cold storage addresses. More work is needed to refine valuation models. That said, even though bitcoin’s core value proposition is as a store of value, we do think we’re still in the early adoption phase, and hence using a valuation metric that reflects this adoption makes sense to us. In that context, we think the NVM’s on-chain activity based valuation method has merit.) The related NVT ratio, which tries to measure if the daily dollar value of all bitcoin transactions is relatively high or low versus the market cap, also suggests overvaluation. Finally, in the past few months, we’ve also seen a number of macro events that would appear to be bullish for bitcoin as a safe haven: the North Korea debacle, a spike in volatility, Chinese stocks breaking down, etc. However, these shocks didn’t move the meter for bitcoin. All this being said, lower bitcoin prices ahead are not a foregone conclusion: We think the market likely needs more time to absorb the recent 30-month rally, which could produce lower prices. We don’t foresee new all-time highs in bitcoin for 2018, and unless data starts suggesting differently, we are expecting mostly sideways or lower price action.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) price pullback from the recent highs above $8,500 is increasingly looking like a short-term bear market on the technical charts. The leading cryptocurrency fell to a two-week low of $7,282 earlier today on Biffinex and was last seen trading at $7,350 – down 3 percent on a 24-hour basis. The sell-off from the recent high of $8,507 had shown signs of exhaustion near $7,455 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the June low of $5,755) on Wednesday, raising prospects of a move higher to $8,000. However, BTC did not find takers on Thursday and the resulting failure to capitalize on the signs of bearish exhaustion ended up encouraging the bears to push the cryptocurrency down to two-week lows as expected. At press time, BTC has found acceptance below the key support of $7,455 and has retraced 40 percent of the rally from $5,755 to $8,507. What’s more, the cryptocurrency also closed yesterday below the former resistance-turned-support of the 100-day moving average (MA). As a result, BTC appears to have entered a short-term bear market. The price chart analysis shows the prices could drop further to $7,130. BTC closed below the 100-day MA yesterday, adding credence to the signs of a short-term bearish reversal: a bearish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs) and a downside break of the ascending trendline by the relative strength index (RSI). Moreover, the 100-day MA had acted as stiff resistance before it was taken out on July 23. It is worth noting that BTC rallied by $800 on the following day, boosting the 100-day MA’s appeal as a key technical level. Hence, the bears could be feeling emboldened, having cleared the 100-day MA support yesterday. Further, BTC has also dropped below $7,455 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement), which served as good support earlier this week. And last but not the least, the relative strength index (RSI) has dipped below 50.00 (in bearish territory). Clearly, the tide has turned in favor of the bears – at least for the short-term – and a further drop could be on the cards, albeit after a re-test of the 100-day MA of $7,583.  The RSI is hovering below 30.00, indicating oversold conditions and the chart also shows a bullish divergence of the RSI. Hence, a minor rally to $7,583–$7,600 cannot be ruled out, although the gains will likely be short-lived, courtesy of the bearish setup on the daily chart.

" Having defended the key support of $7,455, the bitcoin bulls now need a quick move higher in order to neutralize the threat of a short-term bearish reversal. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,560 on Bitfinex – down 11 percent from the recent high of $8,507. However, that still marks a gain of more than 30 percent from the June 24 low of $5,755. So, it is safe to say the bullish trend is still intact. Further, BTC’s solid defense of $7,455 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the June low) seen in the last 28 hours has raised the prospect of a minor corrective rally. However, the bulls have little margin for error and the upside needs to gather traction soon as the short-duration technical studies have already adopted a bearish bias, as seen in the chart below. The bearish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs) indicates a short-term bearish setup. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has breached the key ascending trendline in favor of the bears.  The 50-hour, 100-hour, and 200-hour MAs are trending south and are located one below the other, indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. Meanwhile, the RSI has dropped below 50.00 (in bearish territory). Clearly, the short-term charts are aligned in favor of the bears. So, there is a real risk of BTC falling below the crucial support of $7,455 in the next 24 hours. Moreover, acceptance below that level would only bolster the already bearish setup discussed above and would confirm a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.

" Bitcoin’s price posted gains in the first month of the third quarter, snapping the longest losing streak it’s seen in nearly two years. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose 20 percent in July, having registered losses in the previous two months – the first instance of back-to-back monthly drops since August 2016. At press time, bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $7,580, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  At first instance, the rally seen in July may appear corrective in nature as BTC was looking oversold at the end of Q2, courtesy of a 58 percent drop in the first six months of the year. However, a detailed look at crypto market metrics reveals the July rally had substance. To start with, the BTC dominance rate surged in July as prices recovered from the yearly lows below 6,000, indicating the investors are likely betting on a sustained rally in BTC and are not merely buying the leading cryptocurrency to rotate money into other innovations.  Secondly, trading volumes showed signs of life, adding credence to BTC’s inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal. The average daily trading volume in July was $4.56 billion – up 5.11 percent compared to the average daily trading volume of $4.34 billion seen in June, according to CoinMarketCap data. Also, the average daily trading volume rose for the first time in July after three straight monthly declines. Clearly, BTC looks primed for further gains after July’s 20 percent price rise. Still, the bulls need to adopt a cautious stance as the major part of the rally was likely fueled by expectations that institutional money would flow into cryptocurrency waters if the US SEC approves bitcoin exchange-traded-funds (ETFs). Thus, a BTC rally could unravel if the SEC rejects proposals for ETF approval. We have already seen the trailer of what could happen if the SEC continues to play spoilsport. For instance, BTC prices fell sharply from $8,200 to $7,900 last Thursday on SEC’s rejection of the Winklevoss bitcoin ETF and more importantly, the bullish momentum has weakened since Friday. Looking ahead, BTC could continue to rise as increasing calls for bitcoin ETF will likely keep the cryptocurrency in demand. The technical studies are also biased toward the bulls.  Bitcoin cleared the falling channel last week, signaling the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached in December has ended. What bulls need now is a convincing move through the 50-week moving average (MA), currently located at $8,430. If scaled, the cryptocurrency will likely attack $10,000 in a couple of weeks.

" Bitcoin (BTC) could be in for a minor bout of consolidation following an 11 percent drop from recent highs above $8,500. At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,570 on Bitfinex, having clocked a nine-day low of $7,469 earlier today. A minor correction was overdue, though, as BTC had looked overbought a week ago at the two-month high of $8,507. Things took a turn for the worse in the last 24 hours, as BTC’s overlong sideways action ended with a downside break and the bargain hunters failed to turn up at the key support of $7,800. As a result, the cryptocurrency ended up retracing more than 35 percent of the rally from the June 24 low of $5,755. Clearly, the tide has turned in favor of the bears in the last 24 hours, although oversold conditions and indecisiveness seen in the short duration charts will likely keep the cryptocurrency range-bound in the next 24 hours.  The above chart shows BTC has created a doji candle at the key support of $7,455 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement), indicating indecision in the market. A minor corrective rally to $7,800 could be on the cards if the current 4-hour candle closes above the previous doji candle’s high of $7,587. The relative strength index (RSI) is holding well below 30.00, signaling oversold conditions. So, this appears to be the most likely scenario. That said, the gains will likely be short-lived as 5-candle and 10-candle moving averages (MAs) are trending south, indicating a bearish setup. Further, the cryptocurrency has found acceptance below the key support of $7,815 (July 27 low), meaning the bears are in control. Acceptance below the immediate support of $7,456 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement) would strengthen the bear case, although oversold conditions are seen capping losses around $7,400.

" Bitcoin bears may be in the midst of taking an upper-hand. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $7,536 on Bitfinex, down 6.9 percent on the day, a figure that also finds the price breaking a key support level at $7,800. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been largely confined to a narrow price range of $7,673–$7,800, since it broke $8,000 yesterday. However, mounting sell volume continues to apply downward pressure, presenting a bleak outlook for bulls looking to take back the reins. As such, bulls now are looking for 24-hour volume in excess of 2.4 billion, a threshold that would inspire hope of a reversal.   For those eyeing the charts, the extenuated bearish MACD demonstrates high price volatility and negative price action with the signal line (orange line) continuing to plow under. The above chart shows:  The hourly Relative Strength Index (RSI) tells of a fight currently playing out between the bulls and bears as it hangs at 23.142 at press time, presenting a possible weak bullish divergence before the closing period. If it drops below 22.745 it would expose the lowest levels in three weeks – since July 10. This would create a short-term rebound whereby price action would need to be reassessed.

" Bitcoin’s 26 percent rally left many a cryptocurrency in the dust over the course of July. Indeed, the bitcoin dominance rate, a widely used indicator that tracks the percentage of the total crypto market cap contributed by bitcoin, rose to 48 percent, up from 42 percent, to record a 7-month high over the 31-day period, a function of money shifting from alternative cryptocurrencies into bitcoin.  That said, not every alternative cryptocurrency saw gains. Ether, the cryptocurrency that powers the ethereum blockchain, and the second-largest cryptocurrency by total value, as an example, recorded a monthly loss. A notable exception among the largest 25 cryptocurrencies reviewed by CoinDesk, however, was stellar’s XLM token, which was able to defy the odds and become the top monthly performer in its class. Fueled by interest from the most influential U.S. exchange, Coinbase, the news the startup is considering an XLM listing revved up investor interest, spiking 13 percent on the news. Still, it’s arguable that this simply helped galvanize stellar’s appeal after notable recent milestones. In recent months, teams seeking to launch initial coin offerings (ICOs), including social messenger Kik, have begun to utilize stellar’s technology. Also notable has been the team’s technical commitments, such as its prominent support for the scaling solution, lightning network, which developers say they aim to implement this year. Along the ride, stellar would go on to hold its gains, though, eventually displacing litecoin to become the world’s sixth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization – valued today just north of $5 billion. Monthly performance: +40 percent
All-time high: $0.90
Closing price on June 30: $0.19
Current market price: $0.27
Rank as per market capitalization: 6 XLM began its monthly ascent on July 13 (Coinbase news), reaching its monthly high of $0.36 12 days later when it showed a 93 percent gain from the month’s open of $0.19.  Still, the crypto asset cooled off during the last week of the July, dropping 11 percent, likely due to overextended technical charts and a wavering bitcoin price. When July came to a close, Stellar finalized its 40 percent month-to-month appreciation.  Price closed above the two-month long descending trendline (yellow) on July 14, a bullish signal seen in the chart above, and continued its journey past the 200 day exponential moving average to the 0.618 Fibonacci Retracement (from May high of $0.47). Its monthly high mark of $0.36 was set shortly after on July 25. The combination of resistances proved to be too strong as price failed to find acceptance above the levels, first hinted by bearish divergence in the daily RSI. Price consequently reversed over 24 percent to where it stands today just below $0.28.  Only a daily close below the long term trendline (blue) would return the immediate trend to bearish favor and suggest a move towards the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement located near $0.23. On the upside, a bounce off of the trendline could be seen as a successful throwback test and would add credence to the bullish trend change, setting sights back on the elusive $0.36 resistance.

" Bitcoin’s price risks deeper losses below $8,000 as the bears seem to be winning a four-day-long tug-of-war with the bulls. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $7,950 on Bitfinex – down 2 percent in the last 24 hours – having clocked a low of $7,930 earlier today. The cryptocurrency has been largely restricted to a narrow range of $8,300–$8,050 since late Friday. Consequently, the Bollinger bandwidth – a volatility indicator – dropped today to the lowest level since October, as per the short duration technical chart. Hence, we could be in for a big move, as a prolonged period of low volatility (range-bound activity) usually makes way for a big move on either side. Further, the big move (if it does materialize) could happen to the downside as the bull case has weakened following BTC’s failure to capitalize on a descending broadening channel breakout witnessed on Friday.  The above chart shows: Clearly, the technical chart is aligned in favor of the bears. Further, the decline could be sharp, a key volatility gauge indicates.  The volatility, as represented by the Bollinger bandwidth (gap between the bands) on the 4-hour chart, fell today to its lowest level since October. As stated earlier, an extended period of low volatility is usually followed by a big move, which is seen happening to the downside. As a result, BTC could suffer a deeper drop below the $8,000 mark.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is consolidating in a narrow range at press time and could regain bullish momentum above $8,350, technical charts indicate. The leading cryptocurrency moved back above $8,000 on Friday as expected and was seen rising to recent highs above $8,500 over the weekend. However, BTC has traded in a sideways manner in the last 60 hours. The upside has been capped around $8,300 and dips to $8,050 have been short-lived, according to Bitfinex data. Despite the bull breakout, the price consolidation has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook, yet it is still too early to call a bearish reversal. Further, buyers may feel emboldened if the $250 trading range is breached to the upside, resulting in a resumption of the rally. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,170 on Bitfinex.  BTC witnessed a descending broadening channel breakout on Friday – a continuation pattern – which signaled a revival of the rally and opened the doors to a re-test of $8,507 (July 24 high). However, the bullish move failed to materialize and the cryptocurrency ended up creating a sideways channel over the weekend, as seen in the above chart. An upside break of the sideways channel now would validate the descending broadening channel breakout and allow a rally to 200-day moving average (MA) of $8,468. On the other hand, a move back into the descending broadening channel could prove costly. That said, the probability of a bullish breakout of the sideways channel is high as the major moving averages are biased toward the bulls. For instance, the 50-candle, 100-candle, and 200-candle MA are trending north and located one below the other.  The relative strength index (RSI) is no longer reporting overbought conditions, meaning there is room for a rally to recent highs above $8,500 on the upside break of the sideways channel seen in the 4-hour chart. Further, the 10-day MA continues to rise in a bullish manner. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" If cryptocurrency is decentralizing the world of money, a new bitcoin wallet startup thinks it could also help decentralize the world of work. Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Misthos launched its multi-signature wallet Monday on top of Blockstack‘s decentralized application platform. One of the first enterprise products launched on Blockstack, the wallet is designed for project teams, investment partnerships and other ad hoc ventures to manage the divvying up of income (received as bitcoin) among their individual members. These organizations, which often form to carry out a specific objective before disbanding (more like a Hollywood production than a corporation), “want to have transparency into where their cash is going and want to be able to distribute their income in a fair way,” Misthos founder Justin Carter told CoinDesk. To that end, all proposed payouts from a venture using a Misthos wallet must be approved unanimously by the partners in that venture. Carter described this model as “moving away from an employee-employer relationship to a group consensus about who contributed value.” In other words, instead of a getting paid according to a salary or contract negotiated before taking on a job, the individual is compensated based on social consensus among the team. Misthos makes its money by collecting a 1.49 percent cut of the payouts. Similarly, proposals to add partners are subject to approval by all the existing participants, and in order to kick one person out, everyone else in the group must agree to it. Several partnerships are already using Misthos to distribute bitcoin among members, including the four-person team behind Munich-based bitcoin publication Coin Trainer. “It helps us create a transparent environment where contributions are rewarded fairly and democratically,” Marcel Kasper, one of the co-founders of Coin Trainer, told CoinDesk. Eventually, this collaborative model could be applied to managing fiat currency income for projects as well, but bitcoin was a natural starting point, Carter said. “We are starting to build out the product on bitcoin is because of the reduced friction, as we have no institutional dependencies,” he told CoinDesk, adding: “Crypto-first is about first developing a financial service for the new platform (cryptocurrencies). And once the overall experience is well-defined, adapting it to the old platforms, integrating with legacy financial institutions operating in fiat.” Misthos is part of a broader push across the cryptocurrency community to support less centralized employment models. Opolis, for example, is a professional employment organization (PEO) that handles outsourced human resources functions such as benefits and payroll for employers. However, it caters to a specialized clientele, including blockchain projects and startups, and has close ties to ConsenSys, the ethereum design studio. By the end of the month, roughly 300 Opolis users will be able to facilitate crypto or fiat payrolls, employee benefits, and tax documents through this one-stop-shop service provider. The company also runs an employment marketplace for recruiters and job seekers, and it has a grander vision of future “decentralized employment organizations,” or DEOs. John Paller, a co-founder of Opolis, told CoinDesk his platform is optimized for individual contractors instead of corporate hierarchies. “[Freelancers] can choose and vote on any benefits they want, any number of things, including things that are out of the scope of traditional options today,” he said. “For example, you could have part of your income go to a group investment model.” Both Misthos and Opolis use decentralized data solutions of some kind for worker IDs and credentials, making it easier to recruit, onboard and offboard collaborators. “There’s also storage that Blockstack provides, and part of that we’re leveraging,” Carter said of Misthos, which uses Blockstack IDs for logins and wallet management. “All the history of the ventures is all stored with the individual partners.” Stepping back, it’s easy to see why these entrepreneurs see an opportunity in offering solutions tailored for project-specific, flexible employment arrangements. These days many of the ecosystem’s leading developers prefer to work independently. Turnover at crypto startups is particularly high. Indeed, Wall Street veteran turned startup advisor Jill Carlson told CoinDesk a wide range of workers with soft skills could benefit from employment opportunities modeled after open source collaborations. In traditional freelance contract negotiations, “You have very little leverage,” Carlson said. “I want to be able to do this style of work but to scale it in some way.” On the other hand, Carlson also emphasized the importance of training and mentorship provided by traditional employers. To bring bitcoin’s ethos to the workplace, some collaboration will need to take place offline, face-to-face. “I do my best work when I’m with other people,” she said. Plus, in her view, it’s important to consider how crypto community politics, and arguments on social media platforms where “a lot of nuance is being lost,” could impact project governance on Misthos, which she nevertheless said offers a compelling idea for on-chain bounty management. Carter agreed that much of the social governance will take place off of the Misthos payroll platform. “The point Misthos steps in is for a form of documentation and execution,” he said. This is why Jude Nelson, lead blockchain engineer at Blockstack, told CoinDesk such democratic projects will require both on-chain and off-chain coordination. He concluded: “On-chain smart contracts are likely necessary for users of a dapp who don’t know each other. But since all partners in a Misthos venture must know one another before signing off on a payment, they are able to coordinate pay-outs off-chain without needing a potentially cumbersome on-chain smart contract.” Men and coins image via Shutterstock",2018-07-30
" Cryptocurrency investment firm Pantera Capital reported a more than 10,000 percent lifetime return on Friday, coming five years after its formation. In an email, co-chief investment officers Dan Morehead (who is also CEO) and Joey Krug shared the figure as they celebrated the fund’s fifth anniversary. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they’re still bullish about bitcoin, particularly in the years since Pantera’s launch, noting that “the Fund’s lifetime return is 10,136.15% net of fees and expenses.” To that end, Morehead and Krug included two emails that the fund sent out in 2013 to illustrate that point. “We wanted to share the original logic – as it is equally compelling today,” Morehead and Krug wrote. At the time, an email sent by Morehead predicted that bitcoin – which was trading at $104 at the time – would see $5,000 because “bitcoin dominates cash, electronic fiat money, gold, bearer bonds, large stone discs, etc. It can do all of the things that each of those can. It’s the first global currency since gold. It’s the first borderless payment system ever.” Three months later, bitcoin was trading at $253 when Morehead again touted the principles behind the cryptocurrency. Morehead wrote at the time: “In my opinion, it’s like deciding whether to buy Microsoft back in the day at $0.20 a share. It was hard to do when the stock was just at $0.10. In the fullness of time…clearly a great trade. I believe bitcoin right now is just like that. The world’s first global currency since gold and the world’s only borderless payments system (frictionless to boot) at a market cap of $3bn? Now that Silk Road is gone, a new wave of sophisticated investors are entering.” Pantera, which has since launched its own hedge fund to invest in blockchain startups, plans to travel “over the next months to discuss Venture Fund III and the blockchain disruption.” “We have organized group lunches in many cities, should you want to meet other investors who share your interest in blockchain,” the officers wrote. Some of the firm’s recent investments include sharing economy startup Origin and “stablecoin” startup Basis. Bitcoins image via Shutterstock",2018-07-27
" Bitcoin’s (BTC) drop below $8,000 yesterday may have tempered the positive mood in the market, but the broader outlook still remains bullish, technical charts indicate. The overnight drop in price came soon after the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) second rejection of the Winklevoss brothers’ application for a bitcoin ETF. While the decision may have soured the sentiment in the market, the price pullback was also likely a function of overbought conditions. Notably, the short-duration price chart had warned of a dip below $8,000 yesterday. At press time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading at $7,965 on Bitfinex, having clocked a three-day low of $7,848 earlier today. It is worth noting that BTC is still up 40 percent from the June 24 low of $5,755, despite the pullback from the two-month highs above $8,500. Thus, it is safe to say the bull market is intact.  The bearish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) seen in the above chart may have helped trigger a correction in prices. The drop saw the cryptocurrency beaching the rising channel yesterday, neutralizing the immediate bullish outlook and also establishing a lower highs and lower lows pattern (bearish setup). That said, the path of least resistance remains to the upside as the 50-candle, 100-candle, and 200-candle moving averages (MAs) are rising and located one above the other. The pullback has also allowed the RSI to position itself in a more bull-positive way, meaning it is no longer reporting overbought conditions.  Investors may feel tempted to question the validity of the long-term bullish breakout discussed yesterday as BTC has fallen back into a descending channel. However, asset prices tend to revisit key support levels (former resistance levels) immediately after a long-term bullish breakout due to overbought conditions. This is widely referred to as a “crowding out of weak hands” (that is, bulls with low-risk appetite) before a bigger rally. Hence, a long-term bullish breakout remains on the cards and would be confirmed if BTC makes a weekly close (as per UTC) above $8,050 (falling channel resistance) on Sunday. Meanwhile, BTC retains a short-term bullish outlook, as the 5-day and 10-day MAs continue to rise in favor of the bulls. What’s more, BTC is also trading well above the 50-day MA and 100-day MA hurdle. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) 45 percent month-on-month rally has likely put the leading cryptocurrency on the path to a long-term bull market, technical studies indicate. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,300 on Bitfinex, having clocked a two-month high of $8,507 on Tuesday. A month ago, it was all gloom and doom in the bitcoin market, as the cryptocurrency had created back-to-back long-term bearish chart patterns in the months of May and June. Consequently, BTC looked primed for a move lower to $5,000. However, the inverse head-and-shoulders breakout seen earlier this month confirmed a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change. Furthermore, the convincing break above $8,000 seen this week appears to have set the stage for a major bull run.  To start with, the pennant breakdown witnessed on June 9 had signaled a revival of the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017. However, the ensuing sell-off ran out of steam at $5,755 (June 24 low) and the subsequent recovery established a falling channel (bearish pattern marked by circles), which has been breached to the higher side this week. So, what we have is an upside break of the four-month-long falling channel, i.e. a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  The short-term outlook also remains bullish as indicated by the rising channel (higher highs and higher lows). Still, there is merit in being cautious as the above chart also shows a bearish relative strength index (RSI) divergence, which could yield a price pullback.

" Bitcoin traders may have their eyes on a different kind of chart this week. That’s because Friday, July 27 is the date that bitcoin futures contracts offered by derivatives giant CME Group are scheduled to expire. A financial product that lets institutions and professional traders long or short the crypto asset (betting on its future performance), history shows the price of bitcoin drops 7.89 percent on average in the five days prior to a contract expiration. As such, data suggests the event could trigger a healthy pullback in prices for the cryptocurrency. Still, other factors may be at play this time around. Investor interest in the bitcoin futures market is seeing substantial growth – perhaps best depicted by a tweet from the CME Group which stated that their bitcoin futures product was up 93 percent in volume and 58 percent in open interest in Q2. CME futures continued their growth into Q3 including a record volume of contracts set this past Tuesday, equivalent to 64,390 bitcoins with a notional value of $530 million, according to another tweet from the CME Group. While the numbers are encouraging for widespread adoption of bitcoin investment, many have argued bitcoin futures negatively impact price. Prior to the introduction of bitcoin futures, there were few options for traditional investors to short the market, and this particular investment type has accomplished just that, allowing bears to speculate alongside the bulls. Again interest to what’s ahead is that the price of bitcoin has been on the rebound over the last few weeks where at press time, bitcoin is trading at $8,182 – printing a 41 percent increase from its annual low ($5,799) set less than a month ago, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. That said, the dramatic growth has led to overextended technical charts, including the highest daily RSI level since December, which could be a factor in helping history repeat.  As seen in the chart above, the price of bitcoin recorded a loss in the five days leading up to the expiry on four out of the six occasions where futures have expired. Most notably, in the days prior to the close of the January and March contracts, price fell 13.05 and 20.45 percent respectively (closing price on expiry day subtracted from opening price of fifth day prior). The average performance of the four negative occasions comes out to a depreciation of 12.82 percent while the remaining two occasions recorded a meager average gain of 1.69 percent.  Perhaps not coincidentally, Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $19,891 (on Bitfinex) on Dec. 17, 2017, the exact day CME introduced their first bitcoin futures product. Price has been on a steady decline ever since and figures currently reflect a 58 percent depreciation from the high mark. While it should not come as a surprise for prices to drop in a bear market, it will be interesting to see how future’s impact the price of bitcoin, if at all, if the cryptocurrency returns to its bullish glory.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has seen a $350 drop this morning from Tuesday’s two-month highs and may be headed for a short-term correction, technical charts suggest. As of writing, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $8,220 on Bitfinex down 3.5 percent from the high of $8,507 reached yesterday. Today’s dip is not surprising and could be extended further as BTC’s 40 percent rally from the seven-month low of $5,755 reached on June 24 is still looking overstretched, as per the relative strength index (RSI). The short duration charts have also aligned in favor of a deeper correction. However, the bullish reversal has likely revved up investor interest and bargain hunters who missed out on lower prices prior to the rally could step in prevent significant losses.  The 50-hour, 100-hour, and 200-hour moving averages (MAs) are trending north and are located one above the other, indicating the path of least resistance is to the upside. Consequently, these MAs could be the area of interest of the bargain hunter. As of writing, the 50-hour MA is located at $8,023. Meanwhile, the 100-hour MA, currently located at $7,736, almost coincides with the rising trendline, thus dip demand could be strong around that level.  The rising (bullish) 5-day MA and 10-day MA are located at $7,830 and $7,538, respectively. The 100-day MA, which acted as a stiff resistance last week, is seen offering strong support at $7,612. Clearly, the area between the $7,830 and $7,530 is packed with key moving average lines and could act as a strong support zone.

" Bitcoin (BTC) has had a bullish start to the week, but the momentum could wane in the next few days, technical studies indicate. The leading cryptocurrency rose to a two-month high of $8,130 on Bitfinex today, having witnessed an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout last week. The 40 percent rally from the seven-month low of $5,755 reached on June 24 has put the bulls back in a commanding position. Hence, further gains could be on the cards, albeit after a brief pause or a price pullback as a key technical indicator is flashing overbought conditions. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $8,100 on Bitfinex.  Notably, the relative strength index (RSI), one of the most widely used momentum indicators, jumped above 70.00 (overbought zone) earlier today and is currently located at 74.56 – its highest level since December. So, it could be said that bitcoin is at its most overbought level in seven months. As a result, the cryptocurrency may find it hard to gain a foothold above the immediate resistance of $8,140 (pennant resistance) in the next few days and could see a minor price pullback. That said, a technical correction, if any, will likely be short-lived as the other tools are biased towards the bulls. For instance, the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are trending north, indicating a bullish setup. Meanwhile, the short duration charts are also calling a further price rally.  The broadening wedge breakout seen on the chart above indicates a continuation of the rally from the July 17 low of $6,740. Accordingly, the attention has now shifted to the significant price obstacle of the 200-day MA, currently located at $8,676.

" Bitcoin’s price has climbed back above $8,000 for the first time in two months. According to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, the price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization jumped by $200 in just two hours on Wednesday and is changing hands at $8,015 as of press time – that’s a level not seen since May 24. The price of bitcoin had been declining since May 24 and reached a new year’s low at $5,785 on June 24, after which it started regaining momentum for a move back above $8,000, reflecting a nearly 40 percent increase since the June low. Data from Bitfinex shows the trading volume of bitcoin more than doubled amid the price move, having increased from $4.9 million to $12.6 million within just four hours on the exchange. That said, bitcoin is still down nearly 53 percent from the yearly high above $17,000 seen in January. Meanwhile, data shows that bitcoin’s market capitalization dominance has also increased significantly over the past two months. According to CoinMarketCap, bitcoin accounted for 37 percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization in mid-May. Yet that data has increased to 47 percent as of press time, pushing bitcoin’s dominance to a level not seen since late December. Notably, bitcoin is the only top 10 cryptocurrency by market cap that has seen growth over the past 24 hours, with other major cryptos all seeing declines of 1–5 percent, respectively. Image via CoinDesk",2018-07-24
" Bitcoin’s (BTC) price clocked a two-month high of $7,820 today and looks set to extend gains further, a key cryptomarket gauge indicates. CoinMarketCap’s bitcoin dominance rate, an indicator that tracks the percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization contributed by the leading cryptocurrency, rose to 46 percent today — the highest level since December 20 — adding credence to BTC’s 20 percent rally seen in the last seven days. To start with, a rise in the BTC dominance rate essentially means the number one cryptocurrency is more in demand compared to the alternative cryptocurrencies.  The above chart shows: The fact that the BTC price rally from the seven-month lows below $6,000 is accompanied by the sharp rise in the dominance rate indicates the bargain hunters are likely betting on further sustainable gains in BTC prices and are not buying BTC to venture into alternative cryptocurrencies. In the latter case, the dominance rate of alternative cryptocurrencies over bitcoin rises sharply. This usually happens when BTC valuations start looking overstretched and in response investors begin rotating money into other innovations (as happened in late December 2017/early January). So, a sharp rise in the BTC dominance rate, as seen in the last four weeks, could be considered a sign of investor confidence in the current BTC price rally. Hence, BTC could soon find acceptance above the key 100-day moving average (MA) hurdle and cross the $8,000 mark in a convincing manner. At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,700 on Bitfinex — up 3.4 percent on a 24-hour basis.  The rally post-inverse head-and-shoulders breakout ran out of steam around the 100-day MA in the last five days, establishing the MA as a key technical resistance. A daily close (as per UTC) above the 100-day MA of $7,610 would further strengthen the bull grip and open the doors to 200-day MA, currently lined up at $8,720.  BTC is stuck in a broadening wedge — a continuation pattern, meaning an upside break would revive the rally from the July 17 low of $6,740 and open up upside towards the next major resistance located at $8,720 (200-day MA hurdle). The 50-candle, 100-candle, and 200-candle MAs are trending north and positioned one above the other in favor of the bulls. So, BTC is more likely to witness an upside breakout. That said, the bears could make a strong comeback if the broadening wedge is breached to the downside. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" You may have heard of a lagging or leading indicator before. Maybe your friends have tossed around terms like bullish or bearish divergences, oversold or overbought conditions and what signals you should use to enter or exit the market. While there are many tools that can assist with this, one often overlooked indicator is called the stochastic oscillator. Nothing unique to the world of blockchain, the stochastic is a momentum indicator that compares the closing price of the asset with its high-low range over a certain period of time, it’s a handy tool. Even better, it works no matter the volatility, even in the fast-moving market for cryptocurrencies. First, the particulars require a bit of math: Slow %K= 100 [Sum of the (C – L14) for the %K Slowing Period / Sum of the (H14 – L14) for the %K Slowing Period] Slow %D = SMA of Slow %K Where: Fortunately, crypto traders need not worry about the calculation part, as the trading platforms and chart softwares process the complex formula and produce a stochastic oscillator, as seen in the chart below. All you need to know is how to use the oscillator to maximize your efforts. To start with, the indicator can range from 0 to 100. The area above 80 represents overbought conditions, and the area below 20 indicates oversold conditions. So, price rallies usually stall after the stochastic reaches an overbought zone. On the other hand, stochastics reporting oversold conditions are widely considered a sign the bears have reached a point of exhaustion. Further, trend reversal signal occurs when the %K line and the %D line cross in the overbought (above 80.00) or oversold (below 20.00) region.  The above chart shows, bitcoin dropped 11% after the stochastic generated a sell signal on June 9. Further, it rallied more than 8 percent after the stochastic charted a buy signal on June 29 (green arrow). Note that stochastic tends to work best in broad trading ranges or slow-moving trends. Still, the stochastic is one tool of many. The difference between a leading indicator such as the stochastic or Relative Strength Index (RSI) and a lagging indicator such as Moving Averages or Bollinger Bands is that the leading indicators precede price movements, while lagging indicators follow price movements. Their usage also differs during trending and non-trending periods because lagging indicators tend to focus more on the trend and produce fewer buy and sell signals than their leading counterparts.

" The chives growing in one crypto tycoon’s California mansion carry a hidden message. Guo Hongcai, a beef salesman turned early bitcoin adopter from China’s Shanxi province, is one of many freshly minted millionaires funneling parts of their wealth out of the country by purchasing real estate abroad. In April, Hongcai sold 500 bitcoin in the U.S. then used that money to buy a 100,000-square-foot mansion in Los Gatos, a 90-minute drive from San Francisco, California. His Rolls-Royce, also purchased with the fruits of bitcoin arbitrage, sits in the driveway close to a small chives garden. “It’s very normal to sell bitcoin in the U.S. After selling bitcoin, you can just buy anything you want,” he told CoinDesk. Guo calls this secondary residence his “Mansion of Chives,” because the vegetable is also Chinese slang for crypto investors who prove vulnerable to big sell-offs. As Chinese regulators clamp down on industry business on the mainland, crypto millionaires are turning to foreign real estate markets to diversify their holdings. Some purchase property directly with crypto, others like Hongcai use bitcoin to gain foreign currencies without going through a bank. The founders of the U.S. crypto real estate startup Slice told CoinDesk roughly one-third of their prospective users hail from Asia, figures which include Chinese investors seeking tokenized property rights through Hong Kong securities brokers. According to the South China Morning Post, real estate purchased in Hong Kong doesn’t require the same taxes and documentation as other financial assets held abroad. Chinese investment in foreign real estate, often through Hong Kong brokers, has been rising for years. Now early bitcoin adopters are utilizing new wealth for familiar patterns. “The requests we have from them start at $50,000 or $100,000 up to, the latest one was $3 to $4 million for Silicon Valley,” Natalia Karayaneva, CEO of Propy, another crypto-powered real estate marketplace, told CoinDesk. She added: “We’re seeing that more and more people are willing to buy properties with cryptocurrencies because it’s getting easier to get their money out of the country using bitcoin, rather than establishing a bank account based in Hong Kong and getting their money out of the country using business channels.” According to Karayaneva, the U.S. and the U.K. are the most sought-after locations for real estate, especially fintech hubs like London or California’s Bay Area. “They were mostly interested in residential properties next to good education, like Stanford,” she said. “Also, they want to diversify. They want to have parts of their assets abroad in more stable countries.” So far, around half of the traffic to Propy’s website comes from China, out of 50,000 monthly views. It’s a trend that has implications far beyond China, though, especially in California, where, according to statistics gathered over a decade by ATTOM Data Solutions, nearly a quarter of all single-family homes are now purchased in all-cash transactions without a mortgage. According to CEO Roy Dekel at SetSchedule, a California-based startup helping licensed real estate agents connect with buyers and homeowners, it’s more common for Chinese bitcoin veterans to convert cryptocurrency into cash than to buy property directly with it. “We have noticed a drop in Chinese interest, but certain cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York remain strong,” he told CoinDesk. “The ultra-wealthy Chinese have used this source as a diversification of investment.” On the other hand, Dekel also noticed “many blockchain enthusiasts” are buying second homes or investment properties, leading to an uptick in sellers interested in accepting cryptocurrencies directly from international buyers. Since platforms like Propy are compliant across jurisdictions, the reason behind this trend may go beyond tax evasion, speaking to real pain points in legitimate markets. In January, The New York Times asserted that China’s exorbitant housing market is “like a casino.” Further, Reuters reported property development restrictions continue to tighten, such as reduced subsidies for housing developers. “In Beijing, only last year they saw a 40 percent rise in price,” Karayaneva said. “Historically, real estate investors from China are very active abroad because their own property market is going crazy.” All things considered, Chinese buyers are hardly the only ones purchasing property with cryptocurrency. In 2017, Europeans used bitcoin to buy luxury apartments in Dubai’s Aston Crypto Plaza, a project spearheaded by British Baroness Michelle Mone. Wherever it’s taking place, though, it has become increasingly clear that crypto wealth could have a real impact on global real estate patterns. Door image via Shutterstock",2018-07-21
" When it comes to making big money in trading, the trend is your friend. But spotting the trend when it is in the nascent stage is challenging, and running along with it right up to the top is an even bigger challenge. That’s because asset prices rarely see a 90-degree rally or collapse. More often than not, trends (bullish/bearish) will pause briefly to allow traders or investors who missed the initial move (higher or lower) to join the bandwagon. If the participation increases, the asset price extends the bull or bear run, or else a trend reversal may occur. A trader can spot trend extensions with the help of bullish or bearish continuation patterns, which occur in a variety of easily identifiable shapes, some of the most popular of which are known as bull and bear flags. A bull flag is appropriately spotted in an uptrend when the price is likely to continue upward, while the bear flag is conversely spotted in a downtrend when the price is likely to sink further. (While the implication of the pattern is far more important than its name, the “flag” terminology derives from its visual similarity to the fabric you’d see hanging outside a government building.)  Each flag pattern consists of two main components: the pole and flag. The “pole” represents a strong impulsive move (higher/lower) and is backed by a surge in trading volume and the subsequent pause or consolidation the “flag,” which looks like a falling or rising channel. The flag pattern can be invaluable for a trader in that there are clear points of success and failure to profit or mitigate risk from. If resistance breaks in a bull flag, the trader can be confident price will continue upwards roughly the length of the pole (popularly known as measured height method). If support of the bull flag is breached, the trader knows the pattern is invalid and continuation is unlikely. The exact opposite is the case for a bear flag. An asset usually mimics the pole after a bull flag breakout or bear flag breakdown. So, the target is derived as follows: The real world demonstrations of both flag types are depicted below. The Bull Flag  The cryptocurrency cleared the flag resistance on Feb. 20, 2017, signaling a continuation of the rally from the $917 low of the pole and opened upside towards $1,228 (target as per measured height method, i.e. pole height ($157) added to breakout price). Guess what, bitcoin came just $10 shy of price target on Feb. 24, 2017.  In this case, ether broke the flag support on Mar. 17, 2018 suggesting continued depreciation from the $699 pole high and set scope for $463 (target as per measured height method, i.e. pole height ($133) deduced from breakdown price). Surprise, surprise, ether was just $12 shy of reaching the exact price target on March 18, 2018. Bull flags and bear flags can be a trader’s friend in strongly trending markets, but they do not always perform as advertised. In some cases, the pattern can present a trap known as a “false breakout” when price breaches the boundary of the flag and quickly retraces. Waiting for a candlestick to close outside of the flag tends to add credence to the breakout, and can help the trader mitigate risk. As a trader, you would want to avoid betting or punting on an asset price if the bull flag breakout of bear flag breakout is not backed by strong volumes. A low volume move usually ends up trapping investors on the wrong side of the market. Further, using indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to gauge scope for a rally following a breakout can help boost traders’ success rates.

" $8,000? It’s not out of the question. With no price pullback happening in the wake of Tuesday’s sudden surge, the technical charts indicate bitcoin could soon close in on this key psychological benchmark. First, an expected pullback was not without merit (the charts were looking overextended on Tuesday when the 4-hour RSI reached its highest level since 2016), but since Wednesday, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has largely consolidated gains in a narrow range between $7,246 and $7,588. As the trading range tightens and the technical indicators regain composure, the probability of bullish continuation increases. At press time, the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index shows bitcoin is changing hands at $$7484.06 up 0.18 percent on a 24-hour basis.  Bitcoin (BTC) has been in a clear consolidation mode since the conclusion of Tuesday’s rally, but the daily bias remains bullish. Price is sitting comfortably above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline ($7,838) and three of the four important exponential moving averages (EMAs) are trending positively – maintaining the bullish view. The 12-day and 50-day EMAs are nearing a bullish cross while the 100-day EMA is beginning to curve upward, which implies a bullish setup. What’s more, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), an indicator used to measure buy and sell pressure, is still printing levels in bullish favor. A bullish rally will not be an easy feat however since heavy resistance lies in the $7,600-$7,800 range. The resistance zone includes four strong technical hurdles: Another reason for bulls to proceed with caution is the RSI approaching overbought conditions. While the RSI (currently 68) is capable of reaching much higher levels (it hit 93 in December 2017), a level of just 70 halted the previous substantial bullish rally in April. The hourly chart paints a clearer picture of the post-rally consolidation taking place. What started as choppy hourly consolidation morphed into a pennant-like structure, composed of a “higher-low, lower-high pattern.” The pennant formation (continuation pattern) supplemented by price sitting above all four hourly EMAs and the 0.382 Fibonacci Retracement (from May high), as well as the hourly RSI beginning to trend upwards, creates a rather clear short-term bullish bias. As the trading range continues to narrow, the closer BTC is to a breakout. A bullish rally would first likely test the larger pennant resistance (blue line) followed by the upper boundary of the resistance zone mentioned in the daily chart, $7874 (0.5 retracement).

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) minor price pullback yesterday has likely recharged the bulls for a rally towards $8,000, technical charts indicate. The leading cryptocurrency has spent a better part of the last 15 hours trading in the $7,240–$7,440 range, having clocked a 40-day high of $7,588 at 18:00 UTC yesterday. Moreover, BTC was looking overbought at multi-week highs, hence a minor correction was expected. More importantly, the price pullback and the subsequent consolidation, when viewed against the backdrop of the high volume inverse head-and-shoulders breakout, indicate that BTC has likely gathered steam for a more sustainable rally towards $8,000. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $7,400 on Bitfinex – up 0.2 percent on a 24-hour basis.  While BTC’s rally has stalled in the last 24 hours, the bias remains bullish since prices are holding well above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline support (former resistance) of $6,838. The relative strength index (RSI) is hovering above 50.00 (in bullish territory). The 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are trending north, indicating a bullish setup. The chart also shows a bullish crossover between 5-day and 50-day MAs. What’s more, the Bollinger Bands (standard deviation of +2, -2 on the 20-day MA) are beginning to rise in favor of the bulls and the upper Bolliger Band is offering price support. Clearly, bitcoin remains on the hunt for $8,000 and the short duration chart indicates the move could happen in the next 48 hours.  The Bollinger Bands narrowed at 00:00 UTC yesterday, meaning price volatility (as represented by the gap between the Bollinger Bands) has remained low for more than 24 hours. As a result, we could in for a big move in either direction as an extended period of low volatility is often followed by a period of high volatility. That said, the big move will likely happen on the higher side as the RSI is beginning to rise, after having built a base around 46.00 in the last 15 hours. Meanwhile, the major moving averages (50-hour, 100-hour and 200-hour) have caught up with rising prices, which indicates BTC markets are no longer overstretched.  The averages are located one below the other, indicating the path of least resistance is to the upside.

" With Tuesday’s dramatic $600 bitcoin rally came a sharp rise in trading volume, more specifically a 100 percent increase from its 7-month volume low set just four days ago. As of Monday, bitcoin’s 24-hour trading volume had fallen to $2.92 billion, a level last seen on November 7. However, as price volatility tends to follow dramatic volume lows, bitcoin’s breakout yesterday was no exception to the rule: 24-hour trading volume reached $5.9 billion. All in all, this marked a 103.7 percent increase from the 36-week low set this past Saturday. On some exchanges, volumes even set records. A popular high-leverage trading cryptocurrency exchange, Bitmex, experienced its highest bitcoin trading volume in an 8-hour window ever during the price surge yesterday. As seen in the chart below, the value recorded was north of $2.4 billion.  Further, this week’s bitcoin trading volume is already well on its way to surpassing that of the prior week. Since Monday, the cryptocurrency’s trading volume is already above 115,000 BTC units, surpassing 90 percent of the total volume recorded in the prior full week, according to data from the Bitfinex exchange.  Breaking the long-term trend of declining volume could prove crucial for the bitcoin bulls if they wish to regain long term composure, and this week’s action is a step in the right direction.

" Bitcoin (BTC) could be in for a minor price pullback, having clocked a 39-day high above $7,500 earlier today. The leading cryptocurrency rose to $7,562 on Bitfinex at 03:00 UTC and was last seen changing hands at $7,400 – up nearly 10 percent on a 24-hour basis. Further, the price rally has pushed the week-on-week gains higher to 15 percent. On Tuesday, BTC crossed the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance of $6,838 with strength, confirming a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change. So, a rally to $7,900 (inverse head-and-shoulders breakout target) could be on the cards. However, the move may not happen in the next 24 hours as the retreat from $7,562 to $7,370 indicates the bulls are keen on booking profits, having pushed BTC higher by more than $1,300 in the last 72 hours. Further, the technical charts are also reporting intraday overbought conditions, meaning a price pullback could be in the offing before the rally continues. Moreover, investors who missed the initial move higher would have the opportunity to board the BTC freight train on any price pullback. A minor correction, if it occurs, could end up recharging the engines for a sustained rally to $7,900–$8,000. The above chart shows BTC has pulled back from near 100-day moving average (MA) hurdle of $7,613. Still, the bias remains bullish as the cryptocurrency has found acceptance above the 50-day MA. The short-term moving averages (5-day, 10-day) are rising in favor of the bulls and the 5-day MA has cut the 50-day MA from below, confirming a bullish crossover. What’s more, the relative strength index (RSI) has also adopted a bullish bias (above 50.00). As a result, BTC is more likely to extend the rally to $7,900–$8,000 in the short-run and confirm a successful reentry in the pennant pattern. That would be a major blow to BTC bears as the bearish pennant breakdown in June had signaled a revival of the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached in December. A move back inside the pennant pattern would signal a long-term bearish invalidation. Meanwhile, a break above the pennant resistance, currently seen at $8,210, would strengthen the odds of a long-run bullish reversal.  The RSI is beginning to roll over from the overbought territory (above 80.00) and the price pullback will likely gather pace if RSI drops below support at 58.00. Hence, we are unable to rule out a drop in BTC prices to $7,000. That said, the dip is expected to be short-lived as the 50-hour MA, 100-hour MA, and 200-hour MA is located one above the other, indicating the path of least resistance is to the upside.

" The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization exploded in price Tuesday, jumping $600 in 30 minutes to break away from what had been suppressive bear market conditions. But entering Wednesday, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,370 and showing signs it might continue its ascent. In fact, when viewed on longer timeframes, it appears that the trend is changing, this time in favor of the always-optimistic bulls. But just how reliable is this move? So far, there are three general tools traders are using to analyze the markets in a quest to confirm that the change in trend will have staying power.  Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) act like signals that provide crucial insights into the asking bid as well as the momentum behind each major move. As such, they can be used to confirm or deny a trend change by analyzing the position of the EMA in relation to the current price. The longer the EMA, the more significant the move is as it has more data points to collect from and a greater range of price history. Stepping back, the number 55 is a Fibonacci number that technical traders use in relation to other Fibonacci sequences including 8,11 and 21 (usually skipping 34). It can provide crucial information about the current health of a particular stock or asset, and works best when viewed from longer time-frames. For example, from May 11 to July 16, the 55 EMA for bitcoin was above the price acting as a barrier or resistance to any major moves past $6,860 (see positioning of red EMA). Until yesterday, the position of the exponential moving average remained unchallenged, solidifying the bearish perspective over a two-month period. However, the recent bitcoin surge forced the EMA below the current price, confirming that the breakout is both significant and bullish in the mid-term.  Extensions and retracements are used to predict the levels of resistance and support for an underlying stock or asset. (You can use the Fibonacci tool to identify where the most likely region of major resistance or support lies). To draw an extension for bitcoin, take the cursor to the bottom of the previous significant low (June 26) and draw it up toward the significant two month high seen May 5th. Above is an example of specific resistances/supports where historically, they have held and broken through. Any major moves above the neutral Fibonacci extension at 0.5 would add confirmation to the bullish bias for the short term. If however, bitcoin is unable to break that key resistance, a retracement would be more likely whereby the price would need to come down as conditions become overbought. Prices generally retract or extend between the 38.2 percent, 50 percent and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels and are best used in conjunction with other technical indicators such as the exponential moving averages previously mentioned or trading volume.  Another telling sign for traders is the total volume for an underlying stock or asset, so the amount of bitcoin that changed hands in a 24-hour period can be a crucial tell into whether or not the move above $7,000 is meant to last. Above, we see how volume for bitcoin reached a 3-month high yesterday, almost doubling the day prior. As volume increases over a general period, the price action becomes stronger as there is more liquidity and greater buy/sell opportunities to be had than in a low liquidity market. Keep a keen eye on the volume as it is one of the greatest indicators in determining the strength of a particular move in relation to the amount traded.

" Bitcoin (BTC) scaled the crucial 50-day moving average (MA) on Monday for the first time in nearly two months, taking its price above $6,700. The corrective rally picked up the pace 24 hours ago, possibly due to reports stating that BlackRock, INC – the world’s largest asset manager and exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider – is considering venturing into cryptocurrency markets. Later in the day, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink clarified rumors by stating that he doesn’t see a huge demand for cryptocurrencies from clients, Still, BTC remained bid and closed (as per UTC) above the 20-day MA for the first time since May 20, validating the argument that a short-term bottom has been made at $5,755 (June 24 low). While a move above the 50-day MA is encouraging, it does not qualify as a bullish reversal.  Only a convincing break above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline of $6,838 would confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,720 on Bitfinex – up 5 percent in the last 24 hours – and the 50-day MA is located at $6,720.  BTC’s rally from the two-week low of $6,080, hit on Thursday, to today’s high of $6,771 has established a higher low (bullish pattern) on the daily chart. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has moved above 50.00 (in bullish territory) and the short-term moving averages (5-day, 10-day) are beginning to rise in favor of the bulls. So, the cryptocurrency looks set to test $6,838 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline hurdle), albeit after a minor intraday pullback as the short-duration charts are flashing overbought conditions.  The RSI is stationed well above 70.00, indicating the rally from $6,080 is overdone. So, prices could revisit the 10-candle MA support of $6,580 in the next few hours.

" Having defended $6,000 last week, bitcoin (BTC) appears to be building momentum for a price rise, but nearby technical hurdles still present a formidable challenge. At press time, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,689 on Bitfinex and looks to be gaining steam for another test of $6,838. As such, the level is shaping up to be a make-or-break mark, one that could reveal if a classic trend reversal pattern, known as the inverse head-and-shoulders, will take effect. Indeed, a close above that level would amount to a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and open doors for a rally to $7,900 (a target measured by adding the distance from the resistance to the recent low with the break-out level). So, while the bulls may feel emboldened by a possible inverse head-and-shoulders breakout, they are cautioned against being too ambitious. The area between $7,000 – $7,100 hosts more relevant technical hurdles that need to be penetrated in order to prove the bull case. Bitcoin has failed to absorb offers (supply) around $6,850 several times since June 11th, establishing it as a key technical hurdle. (Traders use a tool called the Fibonacci retracement to identify support and resistance levels). Interestingly, the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement from May high of $9,900 happens to be in the same area, according to Bitfinex Exchange. While bulls would have liked to breach resistance on an earlier attempt, the consistent rejection is allowing for an inverse head and shoulders reversal pattern to take form. A convincing break would confirm the inverse head and shoulder reversal, shifting short-term trend into bullish favor. Bitcoin would then likely attack long-term trendline resistance located at $7,050, as seen in the chart below. It’s no secret that bitcoin has been in a commanding bear grip since reaching its all-time high of $19,891 in December of 2017, a picture painted by the long-term downtrend line seen in the chart below.  If the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern takes form, the trendline of resistance would likely be tested in the following hours or days. For a comparable view in bitcoin history, the infamous 2014 bear market formed a similar market structure:  The market finally rebounded after a break and finding support on the downtrend line on Aug. 25, 2015. A convincing break and close above of the current downtrend would carry strong bullish implications surely to shift the intermediate term trend into bullish favor – opening the doors for a move to $7,900 (as per inverse head-and-shoulders measured height method). A rejection from the trendline would likely give an edge back to the bears. Looking down the line, August will be a month every cryptocurrency investor pays close attention to, as the SEC will make a decision regarding the recent CBOE ETF proposal. An approval would be a historic event, as it would open the doors for much awaited institutional investment – a potential inflow of funds bitcoin has never seen before. With that said, another ETF rejection could be just enough of a momentum killer to return bitcoin’s trend into bearish hands.

" Bitcoin is eyeing change of fortunes above $6,800, having convincingly scaled a key moving average hurdle earlier today. At press time, BTC is changing hands at a six-day high of $6,600 on Bitfinex – up 3.44 percent on the day. The cryptocurrency remained bid over the weekend and rose to $6,400 as expected despite low investor participation. For instance, prices rose above $6,300 on Saturday, but trading volumes fell to $2.92 billion, the lowest level since November 7, according to CoinMarketCap. However, the solid move above the 20-day moving average (MA) resistance of $6,400 seen today is backed by a pick-up in trading volume. As of writing, 24-hour trading volume stands at $4.64 billion – up more than 50 percent from the 36-week lows seen on Saturday. Thus, rally looks sustainable and could be extended further towards $6,838 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance). BTC’s recovery from $6,080 (Thursday’s low) and a rally to $6,600 has created a higher low (bullish setup) on the chart. The relative strength index (RSI) is also biased toward the bulls (above 50.00). So, prices look set to test the key resistance at $6,838 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance). Essentially, BTC is now creating the right shoulders of the inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern. Still, there is merit in being cautious as the cryptocurrency looks overbought as per the short duration charts.  The relative strength index (RSI) is at the highest level since April 24, meaning the cryptocurrency is at its most overbought in nearly three months. Hence, a  break above $6,838 might remain elusive for another 24-hours or could be short-lived for the time being.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) sharp recovery from two-week lows hit yesterday has raised the odds of a stronger rally towards $6,400, technical studies indicate. As of writing, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,245 on Bitfinex. BTC was expected to drop below $6,000 in the last 24 hours as the bears were on the offensive following an inverted flag breakdown. However, the intraday oversold conditions likely put a floor under bitcoin prices at the two-week low of $6,080, helping it chart a solid rebound to $6,283 (today’s high). While it is too early to call a bullish reversal, the change of fortune has saved the day for the BTC bulls. Moreover, the probability of BTC’s price charting a picture-perfect inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern would have dropped sharply had BTC found acceptance below $6,000.  The above chart shows BTC created a falling wedge pattern over the last four days, as represented by lower highs and lower lows. Prices crossed the wedge resistance yesterday with strength (backed by a pick-up in volume), signaling the pullback from Monday’s high of $6,820 has ended. The falling wedge breakout also validated the bear-to-bull trend change indicated by the bullish price-relative strength index divergence (higher low on the RSI). So, BTC will likely find acceptance above the immediate resistance $6,270 (50-hour moving average) and rise towards the descending 100-hour MA, currently located at $6,404. While the hourly chart has adopted a bullish bias, the daily chart is still biased to the bears, so the bulls are cautioned against being too ambitious.  The 5-day and 10-day MA are trending south, implying a bearish bias, while the relative strength index (RSI) is holding below 50.00, also indicating the bears are in control. BTC could attack the $6,400 mark, but further gains are ruled out for now as the descending (bearish) 5-day MA and 10-day MA are located at $6,366 and $6,500, respectively. That said, if BTC manages to close (as per UTC) today above 10-day MA, then the doors would open for a re-test of the Monday’s high of $6,820. Bearish scenario: A failure to produce a significant move higher despite the bullish price RSI divergence and the falling wedge breakout would shift risk in favor of a drop to a recent low of $5,755. The downside move will likely gather pace if BTC fails to hold above $6,080 (previous day’s high) over the weekend. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

" Bitcoin (BTC) may be up slightly at the start of Friday’s session, but it remains to be seen if it can build traction above $6,000. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is now down 37 percent from its May 5th high at $9,996 according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, though it’s rebounded to a crucial support zone at $6,235, according to Bitfinex data. The figure is notable, as it could be argued bitcoin needs a daily close above the previous low at $6,070 to abort bearish outlook for the coming week. This would provide greater confidence to the market as a whole, and could possibly spark another minor bullish revival seen over the last eight days. And so far in today’s session, it appears a bullish reversal pattern might be playing out. The inverse head and shoulders pattern as reported by CoinDesk yesterday continues to remain in play as the bears were unable to push the right shoulder below the neckline located at $6,064, adding to the strong possibility of a head-and-shoulders reversal.  Provided the H&S pattern stands, the Fibonacci Retracement tool (taken from previous high on May 5 to July 12 bottom of the current bullish reversal candle) shows significant resistance awaits at $6,400, $6900, $7,021 and $8,046. The 55 exponential moving average (red line) also remains well above  the current price, which suggests the troubled crypto remains bearish in the long term until prices start to crash through the crucial $7,000 resistance zone. Further, the channel between $6,070 and $7,012 remains an incredible uphill battle for the world’s most infamous digital cryptocurrency.  The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily so far offers some solace to back the current H&S reversal which is currently bouncing from the 41.8 point line, previously seen as resistance. If it holds above and remains within the channel (between 41 and 53) another attempt to push toward previous resistances at $6,472 could be possible.

" Bitcoin (BTC) traded largely sideways over the last 24 hours, though a dip soon before press time may threaten a developing bullish chart pattern if the price moves below $6,000. BTC’s drop below the 10-day moving average (MA) on Tuesday neutralized the immediate bullish outlook and shifted risk in favor of a sell-off to $6,000. However, the cryptocurrency defended $6,300 yesterday amid intraday oversold conditions, establishing the round figure as a key short-term support. But, the resilience failed to entice bulls, rather a long liquidation (unwinding of long BTC trades) gathered pace, creating downside pressure on prices. Consequently, BTC fell to a low of $6,145 earlier today and was last seen trading at $6,170. Clearly, the risk of a drop below $6,000 has increased substantially in the last few hours. It is worth noting that the probability of BTC’s price charting a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern would drop sharply if the cryptocurrency finds acceptance below $6,000. The bear flag breakdown, a bearish continuation pattern, indicates the sell-off from the recent high of $6,820 has resumed and prices could revisit the June 24 low of $5,755 (target as per the measured height method). The major moving averages (50,100 and 200) are trending south and are located one below the other, signaling the path of least resistance is to the downside. So, a break below $6,000 could be on the cards. The only factor that may help BTC stay above $6,000 is the oversold conditions shown by the relative strength index (RSI). That said, the relief could be short-lived as the RSI on the longer duration charts is biased to the bears.  The RSI is hovering below 50.00 (bearish) but is holding well above the oversold region (below 30.00), which means there is plenty room for a drop towards $5,755 (bear flag breakdown target).  The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern comprises three successive troughs, the middle trough (head) being the lowest and the two outside troughs (shoulders) being low and roughly equal. In BTC’s case, the left shoulder’s low is $6,108. So, BTC needs to create the right shoulder in the range of $6,000-$6,100, i.e. bulls need to defend the support at $6,000 and stage a solid rebound, else the dream of a picture-perfect inverse head-and-shoulders pattern will remain elusive.

" Bitcoin (BTC) price could create a major bullish technical pattern in the next few days, technical charts indicate. It’s a slightly confusing picture at the moment, however. The recent short-term bullish bias has been neutralized following BTC’s close below (as per UTC) the 10-day moving average (MA) yesterday. Further, the risk of a deeper pullback to $6,000 (February low and psychological support) look to have increased after Tuesday’s 5.7 percent price drop. However, that does not necessarily mean the bears are back in a commanding position, since the cryptocurrency is still holding well above the recent low of $5,755 (hit on June 24). Notably, BTC could end up creating an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern (bullish pattern) soon if the bears fail to penetrate the immediate support of $6,000 in the next couple of days. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,350 on Bitfinex – down 3.6 percent on a 24-hour basis.  BTC’s drop to $6,260 yesterday left another lower high (bearish pattern) on the daily chart, while the relative strength index (RSI) has rolled over in favor of the bears (is back below 50.00). The 5-day and 10-day MAs are also beginning to slope downwards in favor of the bears. The long-term MAs – 50, 100 and 200 – are located one below the other, indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. Thus, BTC looks set to test $6,000 in the next day or two. Acceptance below that level would expose the recent low of $5,755. However, the short duration charts indicate BTC will likely defend the support at $6,000.  The RSI is already reporting oversold conditions (below 30.00) and another $300 drop would only make it harder for the bears to push BTC below $6,000. Hence, we are unable to rule out a rebound from $6,000 – a move which could end up creating the right shoulder of an inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern, as seen in the chart below.  A long-term bull reversal (bear-to-bull trend change) would be confirmed if BTC bounces off the support at $6,000 and sees a high volume break above $6,832 (neckline resistance). The probability of BTC completing the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern remains high as long as prices are holding above $6,000. Increasing arrow image via Shutterstock",2018-07-11
" A few lucky merchants now have one less obstacle to accepting bitcoin payments via the Lightning Network. Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, payment processing startup CoinGate is opening up a pilot program that will allow 100 merchants to trial a Lightning-enabled version of its service, one which taps into the open-source tech meant to make bitcoin transactions fast and cheap. As with CoinGate’s standard service, the company will handle the finer details of crypto-to-fiat exchange, however, the new pilot has the benefit of covering the costs should funds be lost due to the early-stage nature of the software (lightning implementations are now largely in beta). And while most experts believe the network still isn’t ready to support significant commercial transactions, CoinGate CTO Rytis Bieliauskas thinks there’s a greater good that will be achieved in being among the first to test the waters. He told CoinDesk: “It’s a very new technology. Inevitably there will be some bugs, either in our implementation or in the Lightning Network. It will help, not just us, but the whole community because the bugs we find might help the whole protocol.” Although Lightning invoices are typically limited by the protocol itself to 0.042 bitcoin each, or under $300 according to current prices, CoinGate CCO Vilius Semenas told CoinDesk there’s no established limit to how many invoices CoinGate will reimburse if funds are lost. At least for the time being, few shoppers have the resources to send cryptocurrency from a Lightning wallet such as Zap. But this pilot could test whether Lightning actually tackles some of the issues that deter mainstream merchants from prioritizing crypto payments in the first place. For example, bitcoin’s latency presents an issue for CoinGate clients like the Luxembourg-based adult content platform LiveJasmin. “Instant payments are the most important from our point of view,” Tamás Szerencse, head of payments at LiveJasmin, said, expanding on why the company joined CoinGate’s Lightning pilot. With up to 40 million daily visitors, LiveJasmin could become one of the biggest mainstream merchants to experiment with Lightning so far. Experimenting with more diverse transaction types could provide invaluable insight into how Lightning works out in the wild. As such, CoinGate is emerging as one of a small, but growing number of crypto payment processors to take the leap. (Last week GloBee helped crypto hardware wallet accessory provider CryptoCloaks accept its first payment.) Still, most acknowledge there’s still a long way to go until mainstream merchants could safely use Lightning. Steve Beauregard, the founder of the payment processor GoCoin, told CoinDesk he agreed with Bieliauskas that layered networks might be able to reduce friction for recurring payments, but he acknowledged the tech is still in its infancy, which is likely to limit shoppers. “It’s still very complicated for an average end-user to use it [Lightning],” Beauregard said. “I think the ones that benefit the most would be international merchants that are trying to accept payments from overseas.” The majority of merchants who applied for this pilot were businesses like collectibles maker Bitgild, which offers silver and gold coins engraved with QR codes for real cryptocurrency, catering to clients who are already fascinated by Lightning experiments. Beyond cross-border payments, Bieliauskas argued Lightning-enabled transactions could soon provide a cheaper option than credit cards for merchants dealing with micropayments or payments worth a fraction of a penny. For now, Beauregard said the primary value such Lightning pilots offer is an opportunity to participate in experimental research. Speaking to that point, renowned Lightning developer Alex Bosworth agreed this pilot will provide a learn opportunity for the whole network. Lightning’s most useful features for merchants are still in development. Bosworth told CoinDesk: “In the future, one nice thing about Lightning merchants is that if they invoice you in one currency and the payer wants to pay in a different currency, that will be possible.” Bitcoin image via Shutterstock",2018-07-10
" Bitcoin (BTC) is on the defensive today and could suffer deeper losses in the next few days should the bulls fail to defend the key moving average (MA) support, the technical charts indicate. The leading cryptocurrency looked vulnerable to a pullback 24 hours ago, courtesy of the signs of bullish exhaustion near key resistance of $6,800. Hence, the drop to $6436 seen today is not surprising, but has certainly boosted the odds of a close (as per UTC) below the all-important 10-day moving average (MA). It is worth noting that the short-term moving average is still biased to the bulls (rising). So, as discussed yesterday, a strong defense of the 10-day MA support would reinforce the short-term bullish outlook and could yield a rally to $7,000. As of writing, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,460 on Bitfinex – down 5.5 percent from the high of $6,839 reached over the weekend.  The daily candle has already breached the 10-day MA support of $6,585, however, only a close today (as per UTC) below that level would abort the short-term bullish view put forward by the bullish RSI divergence and the falling channel breakout last week. That said, the probability of BTC closing below the 10-day MA is quite high as the short duration charts have already turned bearish.  The rising channel breakdown indicates the corrective rally from the June 24 low of $5,755 has ended. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has turned bearish (below 50.00). Meanwhile, BTC has also breached the support of 200-candle MA. Clearly, the bears must be feeling emboldened Bitcoin image via Shutterstock",2018-07-10
" It may not have been the asset’s biggest rally, but it’s hard to say bitcoin isn’t building on gains. Since hitting an annual low of $5,785 in June, bitcoin has increased roughly 15 percent against the U.S. dollar, and technical indicators suggest the cryptocurrency might not be calling it quits just yet. That said, you’d be forgiven for having doubts. The rally has been interrupted over the past few days by resistance at $6,800, a level first approached on July 4. With a close of $6,584, the day arguably saw control slip back into the hands of bears eager to drive prices lower. However, bears couldn’t further capitalize as price followed the rejection by entering a narrow trading range of less than $250 over the following two days. (Narrowing ranges typically end in a breakout and this was no exception. As such, bulls were able to swing prices back to $6,840 on July 7.) Still, several technical indications suggest positive sentiment is building and that prices could comfortably rise above $7,000 in the coming days.  After rejecting from the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level (from May high of $10,000) the bitcoin price has formed the continuation pattern of a bull flag. What’s more, the CMF, an indicator used for displaying buy and sell pressure, shows buy pressure is mounting while price is traveling down the flag (a bullish divergence). The 4-hour chart also displays a bullish cross of the 50- and 200-period exponential moving averages (EMA), further adding to the bullish bias. The volume profile visible range shows low volume nodes (LVN) near $6,850-7,000, making the levels easier to be penetrated since it is an area lacking overall investor interest. An inverse head-and-shoulders pattern has also appeared on the 4-hour chart, the neckline of which is the same elusive resistance of $6,800 previously mentioned. A convincing close above the neckline has the potential for the trend reversal pattern to take effect, potentially opening the doors to the next Fibonacci retracement (0.382) near $7,400.  On a wider lens, the price of bitcoin recently found support on the 75-week exponential moving average (EMA) for the second time in two years, granting bulls more time to cross their next hurdle – the descending trend line of resistance. A convincing break of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and the $6,800 level would likely send price to the test the fast approaching trendline and potentially break it. Since technical analysis is largely self-fulfilling prophecy, breaking the widely recognized trendline would increase overall bullish sentiment, potentially setting scope for prices in the higher end of the $7,000 range.

" Bitcoin (BTC) rally has stalled near a key resistance range and a minor pullback could recharge the engine for a much-awaited move toward the $7,000 mark. At press time, the premiere cryptocurrency is flatlined at $6,710 on Bitfinex, having clocked an 18-day high of $6,839 over the weekend and is showing signs of bullish exhaustion near the resistance range of $6,750 to $7,910. For instance, BTC has failed thrice in the last seven days to hold on to gains above $6,754, which is the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755. Further, BTC has failed to close (as per UTC) above the stiff resistance at $6,800 in the last two days. What’s more, BTC will likely encounter resistance at $6,850 (multiple daily highs clocked in the third week of June). And last but not the least, the 50-day moving average (MA) resistance is lined up at $6,907. Thus, the area between $6,750 to $6,910 is packed with key resistance levels and the signs of exhaustion near the resistance zone have left the doors open for a minor pullback in BTC prices. That said, the pullback could help BTC build steam for a strong move to $7,000 as the technical studies are biased toward the bulls, as seen in the chart below.  The bullish falling channel breakout and the bullish crossover between 5-day and 10-day MA indicate the tide has turned in favor of the bulls for short-term. The relative strength index (RSI) has moved above 50.00, confirming a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change. Car stop sign image via Shutterstock",2018-07-09
" In the case of bitcoin’s Q2 price movements, it turns out history didn’t repeat. As the three-month period came to a close this week, the final figures indicate bitcoin fell 8 percent according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), snapping a 7-year win streak for the market’s leading cryptocurrency. As seen in the table below, bitcoin had always put on a good show in the second quarter. For instance, BTC’s 1,964 percent rally in Q2 2011 is its best quarterly performance ever. if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""e6Q1G""]={},window.datawrapper[""e6Q1G""].embedDeltas={""100"":475,""200"":365,""300"":323,""400"":306,""500"":306,""700"":289,""800"":289,""900"":289,""1000"":289},window.datawrapper[""e6Q1G""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-e6Q1G""),window.datawrapper[""e6Q1G""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""e6Q1G""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""e6Q1G""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""e6Q1G""==b)window.datawrapper[""e6Q1G""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""}); Clearly, history was on bitcoin’s side and hence, beleaguered bulls were expecting BTC to regain poise in the second quarter following a 50 percent decline in the first quarter.  Accordingly, the cryptocurrency got off to a great start in April only to print fresh 2018 lows in June. The bearish sentiment hit the extreme in early April as pundits took note of the much-feared “death cross” (a bearish crossover between 50-day moving average and 200-day moving average) and began calling a move lower to $2,800 (a level was last seen in September 2017).  However, the lagging indicator trapped bears on the wrong side of the market as oversold conditions put BTC on a recovery mode. Further, the bullish move gathered traction on reports that Soros and Rockefeller are venturing into crypto waters.  Consequently, by April end, BPI was flashing 33 percent month-on-month gain and looked set to scale the $10,000 mark.  The cryptocurrency had breached the long-term falling trendline (drawn from Dec. 17 high and Jan. 6 high) in April. So, emboldened BTC bulls were anticipating a big break above $10,000, which never happened.  Further, things took a turn for worst in mid-May as BTC prices fell below the key 50-day MA and 100-day MA, signaling the path of least resistance is to the downside.  The cryptocurrency continued losing altitude and closed the month with a 19 percent loss.  BTC remained on the defensive throughout June as the long-term technical indicators turned bearish. The 5-month MA crossed the 10-month MA from above, confirming a bearish crossover for the first time in four years.  Further, BTC found acceptance below the 50-week moving average for the first in over two-and-a-half years and suffered a pennant breakdown (bearish continuation pattern). Consequently, prices fell below $6,000 in June for the first time since November and printed a fresh 2018 low of $5,827. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $6,560, according to the BPI. Technically speaking, the cryptocurrency looks set to test $5,000 in the current quarter, as suggested by the pennant breakdown.  However, amid the gloom and doom, the 75-week MA study is offering a positive outlook for bitcoin. The above chart shows BTC has bounced off the key 75-week exponential moving average (EMA) (MA) support. History shows, the moving average is a make or break level for BTC. For instance, BTC’s last bear market ended with an upside break (marked by a square) of the 75-week EMA at the end of 2015 and what followed was a two-year long bull market. So, while there is a reason to be optimistic, bulls are cautioned against being too ambitious as the long-term descending trendline is still intact. Only a break above that level would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change. That said, the probability of BTC crossing the trendline hurdle in Q3 is high, given the cryptocurrency has rebounded from the key 75-week MA.  Note that bears will likely make a strong comeback should BTC fall back below 75-week MA. Bitcoin and US dollar image via Shutterstock",2018-07-06
" The price of bitcoin (BTC) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  The trading range’s lower end is $6,341, a double bottom neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC’s rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range.  A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the double bottom breakout and bull flag breakout earlier this week.  On the other hand, the bullish case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341.  That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex – down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.   The bears may feel emboldened by BTC’s transition from rising channel (bullish setup) to falling channel (bearish setup), as seen in the chart above.  Further, Bollinger Bands (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a bearish setup.  BTC is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours (bearish crossover).   The downside break of the rising channel yesterday added credence to the bearish relative strength index (RSI) divergence and strengthened the bear case.  The chart also shows Bollinger Bands that have adopted bearish bias (beginning to fall).  Knot via Shutterstock",2018-07-06
" Bitcoin (BTC) needs to overcome a key technical resistance to keep the short-term bull market going, technical studies indicate.  The leading cryptocurrency rose to $6,785 on Bitfinex on Wednesday – the highest level since June 22 – and looked set to test the psychological hurdle of $7,000, as suggested by Monday’s bullish breakout.  However, the bulls failed to muster enough momentum to cross $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop from $9,990 to $5,755) on a daily closing basis (as per UTC), establishing the Fibonacci level as a stiff resistance.  Further, a detailed look at the technical charts reveals the area around $6,754 is packed with moving average lines and Bollinger Band, all working in unison to put brakes on BTC price rally.  Hence, a convincing break above the resistance needs to happen soon, else a price pullback could be in the offing.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,620 on Bitfinex.  The above chart shows: Clearly, the odds are stacked in favor of a convincing move above the resistance zone of $6,717-$6,770. The bullish setup in the daily chart also favors a rally to $7,000. However, if BTC fails to pick up a bid in the next few hours, the focus will likely shift to the bearish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence seen in the 4-hour chart. In this case, the rising channel could be breached to the downside, triggering a deeper pullback in BTC prices.  Speed Bump via Shutterstock",2018-07-05
" Bitcoin (BTC) has pulled back from an 11-day high, but the short-term outlook remains bullish, the technical studies indicate. The leading cryptocurrency looked overbought yesterday, as per short-duration indicators, having rallied to $6,681 on Bitfinex on Monday – the highest level since June 22. Consequently, BTC fell back to $6,414 earlier today and was last seen trading at $6,530 – down 2.2 percent on a 24-hour basis. Clearly, the bullish momentum has waned in the last 24 hours, still, the technical charts are biased to the bulls. Further, the probability of BTC rallying to $7,000 (psychological hurdle) remains high while prices are holding above the former resistance-turned-support of $6,341, as seen in the chart below.  BTC breached the double bottom neckline resistance of $6,341 on Saturday, confirming a short-term bullish reversal and opening doors to $6,927 (target as per the measured height method). Further, it built a nice base (marked by a circle) around $6,341 before staging a high volume rally to $6,681 on Sunday. Clearly, $6,341 is a strong support and only a break below that level would weaken the bull case. Currently, BTC is trading well above the neckline support and is looking northwards as indicated by the double bottom breakout and bull flag breakout.  The falling channel breakout and the bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving average (MA) indicate the rally from the June 24 low of $6,755 is likely to continue in the days ahead. On the way higher, BTC may encounter resistance at (June 19 high), $6,880 (upper Bollinger Band), $7,067 (50-day MA). Sniper scope via Shutterstock",2018-07-04
" Bitcoin (BTC) is flashing green, having convincingly scaled a key technical resistance Monday, and looks set to test the $7,000 mark in the next few days. At press time, BTC is trading at $6,575 on Bitfinex – up 3.4 percent in the last 24 hours. The short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change, as indicated by BTC’s break above the significant obstacle of $6,450, will likely entice investors to bargain-hunt, creating an upward pressure on BTC prices. Hence, BTC could rise to $7,000 in the short-term and extend into further gains if its move toward the psychological hurdle is backed by a sharp rise in the trading volume. That said, the crypto asset’s 24-hour trading volume stands at $4.61 billion, according to CoinMarketCap, down 8 percent from Monday despite a bearish-to-bullish trend change.  BTC closed (as per UTC) at $6,618 on Monday, confirming a bullish falling channel breakout. Further, the 5-day and 10-day moving average (MA) is biased to the bulls (sloping upwards), having witnessed a bullish crossover over the weekend. Meanwhile, the relative strength index has moved to neutral (at 50.00) from the bearish territory (below 50.00). What’s more, the Chaikin money flow (CMF) oscillator, which measures the buying and selling pressure, has turned positive for the first time since May 20 and currently stands at the highest level since May 10. The positive print indicates the money is flowing into bitcoin and adds credence to the bullish falling channel breakout.  BTC witnessed a bull flag breakout on Monday, which signaled a continuation of the rally from Friday’s low below $5,800 and could yield a break above $7,000. Clearly, the odds are stacked in favor of a rally to $7,000, however, the move may not happen overnight, as the short-duration charts are reporting overbought conditions. For instance, the hourly chart RSI is rolling over from the overbought territory (above 70.00) as seen in the chart above. Further, the 4-hour RSI is hovering well above 70.00 (in the overbought territory). Hard hat image via Shutterstock",2018-07-03
" Bitcoin is building on Friday’s sharp recovery from lows below $5,800, indicating the corrective rally has more substance than what many presumed to be another “dead cat bounce.” Overall, the premier cryptocurrency jumped to $6,661.76 at 13:00 UTC, a 6.37 percent increase from the day’s low of $6,262.28, and was last seen trading at $6,613, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The broader market followed suit, as it usually does when bitcoin (BTC) flexes its muscles. Currently, the total value of all cryptocurrencies stands at $270 billion, having jumped $14 billion in the in the morning hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Looking ahead, the broader market may remain solidly bid as the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization looks set to test the $7,000 mark, courtesy of a bullish continuation price pattern, as seen in the charts below.  Having faced rejection at flag resistance in Asian hours, the cryptocurrency was expected to revisit flag support. However, BTC unexpectedly picked up a bid at $6,275, setting stage for a big move on the higher side. The subsequent bull flag breakout, as seen in the chart above, signaled a resumption of the rally from Friday’s low below $5,800, temporarily silencing the “dead cat” critics. Price action now sets scope to $7,065 (target as per the measured height method, i.e. pole height added to breakout price). What’s more, the bullish breakout is accompanied by a rise in volume. So, the gains look sustainable.  BTC cleared the falling wedge resistance on Friday, signaling a short-term bear-to-bull trend change. Further, a bullish follow-through to Sunday’s inside bar, as seen today, only validates Friday’s falling wedge breakout and indicates better times ahead for BTC.

" Bitcoin (BTC) has regained poise over the weekend after a drop below $6,000 last week, but a short-term bullish reversal is still not confirmed. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,320 on Bitfinex – up 13 percent from the seven-month low of $5,755 hit on June 24. BTC was expected to remain on the defensive and drop to fresh 2018 lows below $5,755 over the weekend, having closed below $6,000 (February low) on Thursday. However, it unexpectedly picked up a bid at $5,780 on Friday, contradicting the bearish technical setup, and rose to $6,545 on Bitfinex on Saturday – its highest level since June 22. The bounce may be due to sellers running dry, having pushed BTC lower by 70 percent in the first six months of the year. Further, the repeated rebound from sub-$6,000  levels (February low) have established the area below the psychological mark as a significant near-term support. Still, it is too early to call a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change, as the bulls are yet to violate the series of lower price highs and lower price lows, as represented by the falling channel (bearish setup) seen in the chart below.  BTC created a bullish outside-day candle on Friday and closed (as per UTC) well above $6,302 (Friday’s high) on Saturday, confirming a bullish outside-day reversal pattern. However, the follow-through has stalled at the falling channel resistance in the last 48 hours. Hence, we remain cautious and would feel comfortable calling a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change only after BTC has crossed the falling channel hurdle in a convincing manner. That said, the probability of an aggressive move above the falling channel resistance, currently located at $6,450, looks high as the cryptocurrency has created a bull flag – a bullish continuation pattern – on the short duration chart below.  A break above the flag resistance of $6,416 would signal a continuation of the rally from the recent lows below $5,800, and would open the doors to $7,065 (target as per the measured height method, i.e. pole height added to breakout price).

" The price of XRP slid below $0.43 on Friday, hitting a new low for 2018.  The world’s third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell to $0.424 at 13:00 UTC, surpassing the prior low of $0.438 seen just five days ago on the Bitfinex exchange. XRP has not recorded a daily close below $0.42 since December 12th, 2017. As of press time, the figure has risen above the low, back to averaging a price of $0.43. Current prices reflect a 24-hour drop of 3.5 percent and a 14 percent decline week-to-week.  . Market bears will look to strengthen their grip if the current level of $0.43 cannot hold as XRP is not accompanied by any neighboring technical support. The strongest layer of support may not be seen until $0.19. XRP is not the lone cryptocurrency to set an annual low today, however, as it is joined by the likes of OmiseGo (OMG), neo (NEO), litecoin (LTC), and zcash. The largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC), came just $14 shy of breaking its annual low of $5,786 earlier this morning, CoinDesk data further indicates. Consequently, the broader market is taking a beating. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has hit $232 billion – its lowest mark since November of 2017 and a 72 percent depreciation from all-time high just under $830 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.

" Bitcoin (BTC) could post new 2018 lows over the weekend, having found acceptance below key price support. Despite signs of a possible corrective rally seen earlier yesterday, the leading cryptocurrency closed below $6,000 for the first time since November 12, signaling a downside break of a major support (February low). While the bears had briefly pushed prices down to $5,755 (2018 low) last Sunday, a close below $6,000 had remained elusive. Now that prices sit below $6,000, the focus is back on the long-run bearish technical charts, which continue to call a move lower to $5,000. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $5,904 on Bitfinex – down 3.4 percent on a 24-hour basis. Meanwhile, other cryptocurrencies are also flashing red this morning. Names like EOS, litecoin (LTC), cardano (ADA) are reporting 6 percent drops on a 24-hour basis. Ethereum (ETH) and XRP are down 4 percent each, according to CoinMarketCap. Despite the drop below support, bitcoin is still outperforming most other cryptocurrencies and is now at 11th place on the list of best performing top-100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Clearly, investors have become more risk-averse, venturing out of high-risk cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin (and possibly then on to fiat currency). Consequently, the BTC dominance rate has climbed to 43 percent – the highest level since April 12. Unfortunately for the bulls, the stage looks set for a further decline in bitcoin prices. Even so, the bears still need to keep their eyes open, as the unwinding of short positions ahead of month’s end and more importantly, quarter’s end, could again lift prices above $6,000.  The close below $6,000 support has bolstered the already bearish technical setup as indicated by the falling channel (series of lower highs and lower lows), downward sloping 5-day and 10-day moving average (MA). Further, bitcoin is trading well below 50-day, 100-day and 200-day MAs, indicating that the long-term bias is bearish. What’s more, the long-term averages are aligned one below the other and are trending south. The bearish sentiment is quite an obstacle to overcome right now, as the bullish price-to-relative strength index (RSI) and price-to-money flow index divergences seen earlier this week failed to yield a notable corrective rally. Other indicators are also pointing to a strong bearish sentiment. For instance, the Chaikin money flow (CMF), an oscillator that measures buying and selling pressure, is printing negative values for the fifth consecutive week. The drop below $6,000 also adds credence to the pennant breakdown seen in the weekly chart and the bearish crossover between the 5-month and 10-month moving average.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) price charts remain biased to the bears, but market positioning on a major exchange suggests a sustained break below $6,000 may remain elusive in short-term. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,100 on Bitfinex, largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis, and technically speaking, BTC remains on the defensive as discussed yesterday. Further, the cryptocurrency markets will likely remain risk averse as the sell-off in ETH/BTC – the risk barometer of the cryptocurrency markets – is seen gathering pace in the next 24 hours. So, going by the technicals alone, it seems safe to say that BTC is likely to find acceptance below the February low of $6,000 soon. However, activity on Bitfinex, the fourth biggest cryptocurrency exchange by 24-hour trading volume, shows that BTC/USD shorts have been getting liquidated in recent days, while investors have been loading up on BTC/USD longs, creating upward pressure on price. Thus, there is merit in the bears being cautious, as a corrective rally can’t be ruled out.  The falling channel and downward sloping Bollinger Bands (standard deviation of +2, -2 on 20-day moving average) indicate that the bear grip on bitcoin is still intact. The Chaikin money flow (CMF), an oscillator that measures buying and selling pressure, remains below zero, indicating strong selling pressure. The longer the CMF remains the remains in a zone (either above zero or below zero) the more consistent the sentiment. In BTC’s case, bearish sentiment is quite strong as the CMF has been hovering in the negative territory for the fifth consecutive week. BTC could well close (as per UTC) below $6,000 (February low) in the next day or two, and maybe extend the decline from the May high of $9,990 towards $5,000 in the next few weeks.  As mentioned above, BTC/USD longs on Bitfinex have increased by 16.5 percent since June 17, as seen in the chart above. This likely indicates that bargain hunters are finding BTC undervalued around $6,000 – unsurprising, perhaps, as the cryptocurrency is down 70 percent from the all-time record high of almost $20,000 in December.  BTC/USD shorts have dropped 25 percent since Sunday. Interestingly, the charts saw a long-legged doji candle on the same day, indicating bearish exhaustion. Both are factors that may have helped BTC’s defense of $6,000 amid the bearish technical setup. Bitcoin image via Shutterstock",2018-06-28
" Bitcoin’s share of the cryptocurrency market hit a 2.5-month high today – a sign that investors are likely switching their money from alternatives into the industry’s most widely traded asset. As tracked by CoinMarketCap, the gauge rose to 42.74 percent earlier on Wednesday, the highest level since April 14, and was last seen a tad lower at 42.5 percent. The Dominance Index is an indicator that tracks the percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization contributed by the leading cryptocurrency. So, a rising dominance rate essentially means the demand for bitcoin is greater than the demand for other innovations.  A flow toward bitcoin is usually seen at the start of the bull run, as it’s a common route for fiat money to enter the cryptocurrency market. For instance, BTC’s dominance rate rose from 38 percent to 66.5 percent in the six months to December 2017 – a time in which the cryptocurrency rallied from $1,760 to $20,000. However, it also tends to rise during periods of risk aversion – when investors move out of high-risk alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin, and then possibly on to fiat currency. And it’s the latter scenario that we likely are witnessing currently. In the last seven weeks, BTC has crashed from $9,990 to $5,755 and still, the BTC dominance rate has gone from 35.78 percent to 42.75 percent. So, the writing on the wall is clear: right now, a lot of investors prefer cash over any of the cryptocurrencies, bitcoin included. If prices start to rally along with the BTC dominance rate, however, it could mean the crypto markets have bottomed out, finally finding a floor after months of decline.

" After a drop yesterday, bitcoin (BTC) risks another move below $6,000 in the next 24 hours, but it will still likely fare better than other cryptocurrencies. On Tuesday, bitcoin closed (as per UTC) below the immediate support of $6,108 (June 13 low), pouring cold water over the prospects of a corrective rally above a major technical hurdle at $6,425 (April 1 low). The failure to capitalize on early signs of short-term bullish reversal has shifted risk in favor of a break below the $6,000 mark (February low). Even if a drop in prices is seen, bitcoin could still outperform other cryptocurrencies, as a break below $6,000 could trigger risk aversion in the markets, forcing investors to venture out of high-risk alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin. At press time, BTC is trading at $6,100 on Bitfinex – down 2.25 percent on a 24-hour basis.  BTC was expected to scale April 1 low of 6,425 this week, courtesy of the bullish price-relative strength index (RSI) and bullish price-money flow index (MFI) divergence and the long-legged doji. Instead, it created another lower high (bearish pattern) on the chart as it fell from $6,341 (June 25 high) to $6,020 (today’s low). Further, BTC closed (as per UTC) below the immediate support of $6,108 (June 13 low) yesterday, putting the focus back on the broader bearish outlook, as indicated by the falling channel and downward sloping Bollinger Bands (+2,-2 standard deviation on the 20-day moving average). So, BTC could drop below $6,000 in the next 24 hours. On the downside, immediate support is lined up at $5,755 (Sunday’s doji candle low) and $5,717 (lower Bollinger Band). Should prices take a positive turn, immediate resistance is located at $6,341 (June 25 high) and $6,560 (20-day MA). Clearly, BTC chart is biased to the bears, however, other cryptocurrencies will likely post bigger losses, as indicated by a bearish breakdown in ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) exchange rate. The fiat money tends to flow into cryptocurrency markets via major assets like BTC and is then rotated into alternative cryptocurrencies once the bitcoin valuations look overstretched. Further, the rotation of money from bitcoin and into alternative cryptocurrencies is usually a sign the investors are eager to take more risk (a “risk-on” market). On the contrary, rotation of money out of alternative cryptocurrencies and into major assets like BTC happens when investors turn risk-averse (“risk-off” market). As most alternative cryptocurrencies are built on the ethereum blockchain, the ETH/BTC serves as a good indicator of risk-on/risk-off sentiment, i.e. rising ETH/BTC means risk-on and falling ETH/BTC means risk-off. Accordingly, the bearish breakdown seen in the chart below indicates that risk aversion will likely increase in the short-run and the alternative cryptocurrencies will post bigger drops than bitcoin.  The above chart (prices as per Bittrex) shows a bearish Bollinger Band breakdown and a downside break of the trading range. So, ETH/BTC could be heading lower towards 0.0655BTC (Aug. 15, 2017 low).

" Bitcoin (BTC) narrowly missed scaling a key resistance level on Monday, but remains on the hunt for a corrective rally, the technical studies indicate. The cryptocurrency flashed signs of bearish exhaustion yesterday, having defended the $6,000 mark over the weekend. As discussed, a close (as per UTC) above $6,250 (Doji candle high) yesterday would have likely set the tone for a stronger corrective rally. While prices did reach a high of $6,341 yesterday, BTC closed (as per UTC) at $6,247. So, technically speaking, the short-term bull doji reversal is yet to be confirmed. However, a rally may still be on the cards, as prices are holding well above the key support of $6,000 (February low) and the indicators have diverged in favor of the bulls. On the other hand, stiff resistance lined up in the $6,400–$6,800 range could complicate the recovery. At press time, BTC is trading at $6,220 on Bitfinex, having clocked a high of $6,281 earlier today.  Although BTC failed to close above $6,250 yesterday, the green candle has established a bullish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence (lower lows in price and higher lows in the RSI). Meanwhile, the money flow index (MFI) – a momentum indicator that incorporates both price and volume into its calculations – has also created a higher low as opposed to lower lows in price (bullish divergence). The MFI is rising too, indicating an increase in buying pressure. Clearly, the indicators are aligned in favor of a corrective rally in the short-term. That said, the bulls face an uphill task as a number of key resistance hurdles await: Still, the longer outlook remains bearish, with bitcoin still trading in a falling channel. Below $6,000 (February low), major support levels are located at: So, there is a lot of room to the downside and plenty resistance to the upside, and the bulls’ task doesn’t look an easy one. BTC remains on the hunt for a corrective rally to $6,680 (falling channel hurdle). A daily close (as per UTC) above that level would confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and would open the doors to the 50-day moving average, currently located at $7,464. On the downside, a close below $6,000 (February low) would put the focus back on the long-term bearish technicals and boost odds of a drop toward $5,40 (November low).

" Bitcoin (BTC) is again trading above $6,000 and looking up, but today’s closing price will likely set the tone for the rest of the week. The leading cryptocurrency fell to $5,755 at 15:00 UTC on Sunday – the lowest level since Nov. 12 – only to make a quick recovery back above $6,000 an hour later, according to Bitfinex data. The failure to capitalize on the drop, despite the long-run bearish technical setup, suggests that the bears are feeling exhausted, having pushed BTC lower by more than 40 percent (from $9,990 to $6,000) in the last seven weeks. So, a relief rally may be in the offing, but that depends on whether prices close today (as per UTC) on a positive note. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,150 – up 4.5 percent on a 24-hour basis.  BTC created a doji candle on Sunday, normally signaling indecision in the marketplace. However, when viewed against the backdrop of a 40 percent decline from May high of $9,990, Sunday’s doji candle likely represents bearish exhaustion. A notable relief rally could be in the offing if BTC closes today (as per UTC) above $6,250 (Sunday’s doji candle high), confirming a bullish doji reversal. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has begun to diverge in favor of the bulls: creating a higher low despite a lower low in price. So, a positive price action today would also confirm a bullish divergence there. A confirmation of bullish doji reversal and bullish price-RSI divergence would improve the odds of a falling channel breakout. While the short-term outlook stays bearish while BTC is stuck inside the falling channel (bearish pattern), the short duration chart does favor a relief rally in bitcoin.  The bullish price-RSI divergence only adds credence to Sunday’s doji candle and suggests BTC will likely close today above $6,250 today, confirming a bullish doji reversal.

" That kid you know who’s now driving a Lambo because he traded something called dogecoin? He has more in common with Japanese rice traders from the 1700s than you might think.  Besides the ability to brag about their newfound riches, both traders likely analyzed price action and investor emotions by using the candlestick charting style.  Although modernized in the late 1800s by journalist Charles Dow, the core principles of candlestick charting remain intact today. Both the modern and historical technical analysts who swear by the style regard price action as more important than earnings, news or any other fundamental principles.  In other words, all known information is reflected in the price, which is precisely displayed in the candlestick. A candlestick represents the price activity of an asset during a specified timeframe through the use of four main components: the open, close, high and low.  The “open” of a candlestick represents the price of an asset when the trading period begins whereas the “close” represents the price when the period has concluded. The “high” and the “low” represent the highest and lowest prices achieved during the same trading session.  Every candlestick uses two physical features to display the four main components.  Cryptocurrency traders tend to take advantage of the inherent market volatility by using charts on the intra-day time frames. Each candlestick typically represents one, two, four or 12 hours. (A longer-term trader will likely choose to observe candlesticks that represent a single day, week or month.) A candlestick becomes “bullish,” typically green, when the current or closing price rises above its opening price. The candlestick becomes “bearish,” typically red, when its current or closing price falls below the opening price.  A candlestick rarely keeps its figure for too long in the volatile cryptocurrency market. For instance, if the 2-hour candlestick opens at a price of $10 and jumps to $13 an hour later, the shape of the candlestick will have drastically changed since opening. But traders have also come to realize the same candlestick shapes occur at the same stage of a price trend, no matter what is being traded. It can be very lucrative to identify such formations because they can expose clues as to when a trend might reverse, continue or when market indecision is at its peak. Three of the most useful candlesticks for identifying a potential trend change or for gauging market sentiment are the “doji,” “hammer” and “shooting star.” The doji is a prime example of what traders mean when they say a candlestick represents human emotion or market sentiment. When the asset price swings in both directions before closing near its opening price, it is clear the market is indecisive about the asset’s true value.The classic doji candle representing an indecisive market comprises equal-length wicks and a very thin, centrally located body. Further, there are several variations of doji, which signal trend exhaustion/trend reversal.  A hammer is the precursor to a potential downtrend reversal and can be a big money maker for the bulls. Hammers are formed when price sinks below the open only to later return and then close above the open. Such price action signifies that at one point during the trading period sellers temporarily gained control but quickly gave it back and then some, for a bullish close to the candlestick.The physical features of a hammer consist of only one wick roughly two times the length of the body which is located at the top of the candle.  Last but not least, the shooting star is the exact opposite of the hammer.  The shooting star occurs at the peak of an uptrend when the bulls rally to start the trading period, but eventually lose control to the bears who drag prices to a close below the open.It’s important to keep in mind that the longer the duration of the candlestick, the more powerful its effect is on the overarching trend.  For instance, a hammer spotted in a one-hour candlestick will have almost no impact on a 6-month long downtrend, whereas if the hammer formed on a 1-week long candlestick, its reversal impact would be much more significant.

" The price of bitcoin fell to its lowest point since February today. As of press time, the leading cryptocurrency’s price went as low as $6,063, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), a significant drop considering the day’s opening price of $6,717.20. The near-$700 decline (which saw prices decline roughly 10 percent) effectively brought bitcoin to within $100 of its 2018 low of $5,947, reached February 6. At the time, bitcoin was in free-fall amid regulatory uncertainty, with the decline occurring during the week in which the heads of major U.S. regulators were to meet and discuss the cryptocurrency’s price rise with a committee of U.S. lawmakers. Ultimately, however, no action was taken and the price rebounded 40 percent on the week.  Conditions today, however, look different. At press time, bitcoin’s price – currently hovering just above $6,000 – is down more than 60 percent from the 2018 high of $19,783 set in January. Further, aside from some potential action against smaller Japan-based exchanges, no major news drivers are currently impacting the market. Other cryptocurrencies are following suit as bitcoin continues to flirt with support levels, as shown in data published by sources like OnChainFX. Litecoin, for example – the world’s sixth largest cryptocurrency by market cap – hit its lowest level in 7 months on Friday. The price of ether currently at about $479, roughly 60 percent from its all-time high in December 2017. As it stands, the overall cryptocurrency market cap is $259 billion, down from its high of $813 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Other indicators similarly depict the state of the market as it stands today. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), a popular momentum indicator, demonstrates a weekly value of 41 according to Bitfinex exchange data, a level that was last seen in August 2015. Compared to bitcoin’s lowest weekly RSI level (27) for the prolonged bear market in 2014, current levels show scope for significant additional depreciation. Image via Shutterstock",2018-06-22
" Bitcoin’s (BTC) bears may be building for a strong comeback, having pushed prices to a eight-day low below $6,300 earlier on Friday. The price fell to $6,286 on Bitfinex at 09:50 UTC, the lowest level since June 14, and, at press time, was changing hands at $6,326, down around 6 percent over 24 hours. As discussed yesterday, the cryptocurrency’s persistent failure to scale the $6,800 mark in a convincing manner had raised the prospects of another leg down in bitcoin prices. It seems that process is now underway. Bitcoin breached the key support of $6,620 a couple of hours ago – signaling that the relief rally from the June 13 low of $6,108 has ended at $6,850 (June 18 high) and the bears have regained control. The technical charts now indicate scope for a drop below $6,000 over the weekend. BTC’s drop below $6,620 has confirmed a rising wedge breakdown – a bearish reversal pattern indicating the corrective rally has ended and the broader bearish trend has resumed. The stage is now set for a drop to $5,090 (target as per the measured height method, i.e. pole height subtracted from breakdown price). The target looks feasible as the long-term technical charts are also biased to the bears.  As seen above, the pennant breakdown confirmed earlier this month opened up downside towards 100-week moving average (MA), currently located at $4,551. Meanwhile, the bearish crossover between the 5-month and 10-month moving averages (MAs) also favors a convincing break below the immediate support of $6,000 (February low).

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) bulls are struggling to push prices higher, despite a still-favorable short-term set-up on the technical charts. Bitcoin rose to a six-day high of $6,580 on Monday on Bitfinex, adding credence to indications that the cryptocurrency could be in for a relief rally. The bullish bias has strengthened further in the last two days too, courtesy of a bullish Bollinger band breakout and a bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving average (MA). Furthermore, bitcoin refused to embrace the negative narrative on Wednesday after the $31 million hack of South Korea’s Bithumb exchange, indicating that the sellers are likely running dry. Despite all this, though, the cryptocurrency has struggled to find acceptance above $6,800 in the last 72 hours, as seen in the chart below.  Bitcoin printed intraday highs above $6,800 in the last three trading days (as per UTC), but still closed well below the $6,800 mark. The repeated failure to scale $6,800 in a convincing manner forces us to consider the possibility of the bears making a comeback, although the charts do not see that happening while BTC is holding above $6,550. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,730 on Bitfinex.  The chart shows BTC has created a rising wedge –  a bearish continuation pattern. A break below $6,550 (rising wedge support and 50MA support) would put the bears back in the driver’s seat and allow a drop to $6,000. A drop below $6,550 would also push the relative strength index (RSI) below the ascending trendline, further strengthening the bear case. Bitcoin image via Shutterstock",2018-06-21
" The St. Louis division of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank is now tracking the prices of four cryptocurrencies in its research database. According to an announcement on Tuesday, Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), an extensive database maintained by the central bank’s St. Louis branch, is now offering data points for bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum and litecoin. The price data for the well-known and widely cited economic research database is being provided by the U.S. exchange Coinbase and is updated on a daily basis, according to the announcement. Furthermore, the database makes available the historical price data of the four assets back to as early as 2014. The move to add crypto data is not, perhaps, entirely surprising, given that the St. Louis Federal Reserve – a center for local, national and global economic research – has never shied away from taking a focus on cryptocurrencies. Most recently, speaking at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2018 conference in May, James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, raised concerns that the sheer number of cryptocurrencies these days may bring the risk of a “chaos of exchange rates” that has been seen previously in U.S. history – especially during the civil war. The St. Louis branch has had its eyes bitcoin since as early as 2014, when its vice president, David Andolfatto, hosted a seminar on the topic and notably commented at the time that the innovation is forcing traditional institutions to either “adapt or die.” Federal Reserve image via Shutterstock",2018-06-21
" Bitcoin (BTC) suffered a minor dip last night after it was revealed that hackers had again breached a major cryptocurrency exchange, but the charts still favor a corrective rally to $7,000. The cryptocurrency fell from $6,740 to $6,560 after Bithumb – the sixth largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world by trading volume – confirmed that the attack had happened between late Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning local time, adding that about $31 million-worth of cryptocurrencies had been stolen. The Seoul-based cryptocurrency exchange has now halted all deposit and withdrawal service in order to ensure security and announced that it would fully compensate customers. While the hack highlights the security risks that have plagued the cryptocurrency space and has potential to dent investor sentiment, bitcoin is so far refusing to embrace the negative narrative. At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,630 on Bitfinex – down just 1 percent in the last 24 hours and holding well above the Asian session low of $6,560. BTC’s resilience has ensured the technical charts are retaining short-term bullish bias, and is trading above the support of the 50-candle moving average (MA) on the 4-hour chart, currently at $6,545.  The chart shows a rounding bottom – a bullish reversal pattern – meaning sentiment has gradually shifted from bearish to bullish over the last 10 days. The relative strength index (RSI) is also holding above 50.00 (in bullish territory). BTC also recently witnessed a bullish Bollinger Band breakout, as discussed yesterday. So, the short-term outlook remains positive and only a break below the ascending trendline (dotted yellow line) would weaken the bull case.  As seen above, the bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day MA further indicates a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change. Top image via Shutterstock",2018-06-20
" Despite the bearish chart setup, bitcoin (BTC) rose to a six-day high on Monday, putting a corrective rally to $7,000 back on the map. The leading cryptocurrency unexpectedly picked up a bid around $6,450 at 16:00 UTC yesterday and rose to $6,850 – the highest level since June 12, according to Bitfinex data. The $400 rally may have trapped a few bears on the wrong side of the market, given the pennant breakdown on the 4-hour chart had called for a drop to $6,000. Yesterday’s gravity-defying price action in BTC has boosted the odds of a rally to $7,024 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $9,990 to $6,108). However, the long-run outlook remains bearish for now. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $6,700 on Bitfinex.  As seen in the chart above, the 4-hour candle crossed the upper Bollinger band in a convincing manner yesterday, signaling a bullish Bollinger band (standard deviation of +2 and -2 on 20-candle moving average) breakout. Trading volume also picked up (circled on chart), adding credence to the bullish move. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency has also found acceptance above the 50-candle moving average (MA) and the relative strength index (RSI) is biased bullish (above 50.00). So, BTC will likely clear the immediate resistance at $6,736 (yellow dotted line) and test supply around $7,024 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop from $9,990 to $6,108) in the next 24 hours. It’s worth noting that the descending (bearish) 100-candle MA is located at $7,045, marking a key resistance level for the bulls. The positive Bollinger band setup also validates the argument put forward by the bullish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence last week that the cryptocurrency has found a temporary low at around $6,100. BTC closed above the 10-day MA yesterday, invalidating the immediate bearish outlook. It also created a bullish outside-day candle on Monday (price action engulfed Sunday’s high and low) – that is, the day began on a pessimistic note, but ended optimistically. Thus, the probability that the corrective rally will gather traction is high. Compass image via Shutterstock",2018-06-19
" Bitcoin (BTC) is once more facing a drop to (or below) $6,000, with both short- and long-duration charts being aligned in favor of the bears. The cryptocurrency found acceptance above the key resistance of $6,425 (April 1 low) in the second half of last week, raising the prospects of a corrective rally towards the $7,000 mark. Further, while a fall to $6,000 following a bear flag breakdown on Friday seemed likely, losses were unexpectedly cut short at $6,300, signaling bearish exhaustion. Yet, the leading cryptocurrency did not find any takers over the weekend, leaving trading flat-lined above $6,500. Courtesy of the drop from $6,573 (Sunday’s high) to $6,370 (today’s low), the short duration charts have now turned bearish. Meanwhile, the long duration charts continue calling a bearish move. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,430 on Bitfinex – down 1.3 percent over 24 hours and is looking southwards.  BTC’s drop to $6,370 earlier today confirmed a downside break of the pennant – a bearish continuation pattern indicating the sell-off from the high of $7,638 has resumed. As a result, the cryptocurrency could slide to $5,820 (target as per the measured height method, i.e. the difference between the pennant high and low subtracted from the breakdown price). The moving averages (MAs) are also biased bearish, with the 50-candle, 100-candle and 200-candle MAs all trending south. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) is struggling to rise above 50.00 (into bullish territory).  BTC remains trapped inside a falling channel, the RSI remains below 50.00 (in bearish territory) and the 10-day MA is falling (bearish).  The 5-week and 10-week MAs are losing altitude, signaling a bearish setup and adding credence to the pennant breakdown. The 10-week MA is about to cross the 50-week MA from above (bearish crossover) for the first time since September 2015. Dice image via Shutterstock",2018-06-18
" The price of bitcoin (BTC) may be up slightly Wednesday, but that hasn’t exactly raised the spirits of the asset’s most avid investors. Rather, with the market now down roughly 70 percent from 2017’s highs, many HOLDers, the bitcoin faithful who have vowed never to sell, are becoming convinced they might have seen the last big rally before another long-time bear market (as happened in 2014). In crypto lingo, it’s time to put on some gloves for another “crypto winter.” Put more simply, investors now think they’ll face a long period where the market might be unable to attract new investment. Adding to the reasoning? It’s happened before. The cryptocurrency once dropped by 70 percent in a seven-month time period from June 2014 to January 2015 – the longest bear market time period in crypto. At the time, many people panicked and sold. Except this time, bitcoin’s faithful say they will stay more optimistic. To remind themselves of what happened in the past (and to prepare for a possibly tough time ahead), an online meme titled “things I did during the 14/15 bear market” is trending on social media right now. It all started from Twitter user @PhilCrypto77’s tweet yesterday.
 And then @WhalePanda followed:
 Soon, it was over all Twitter. Some of the posts were pretty serious and inspiring:     Others took a more delightful and entertaining tone:
   Still, it’s important to remember why the meme is still trendy, as it reflects how HODLers have learned how to stay calm during tough times. In some ways, this means even the most sophomoric tweets might actually be a sign that the industry is maturing. So, how are you HODLing up? Bitcoins in snow image via Shutterstock",2018-06-14
" Bitcoin (BTC) has made a 6 percent recovery from the 90-day low hit on Wednesday, neutralizing the immediate bearish outlook. The leading cryptocurrency fell to $6,108 at around 16:30 UTC yesterday on Bitfinex – its lowest level since February 6 – bolstering the already oversold conditions shown by the daily relative strength index (RSI) yesterday. Hence, the subsequent recovery to $6,500 levels currently is hardly surprising and indicates that bitcoin may have found a temporary bottom around $6,100. However, long-run technical setup remains bearish and the battered bulls will want to see stronger evidence of bear exhaustion before hitting the market with fresh bids. Consequently, the market could remain directionless over the next 48 hours and bargain hunters may chip in later if the cryptocurrency looks stable around $6,500.  While prices fell to $6,108 yesterday, the RSI created a higher low, signaling a bullish divergence. So, the stage is set for a corrective rally, although the upside is seen gathering steam only if bitcoin manages to hold above $6,425 (April 1 low) for next 24 hours. In this case, a move toward $7,000 becomes more of a possibility, or even as high as the falling channel resistance, currently located at $7,380. That will be easier said than done, though, as the moving averages (MAs) are still biased bearish – the 50-candle, 100-candle and 200-candle MAs are all trending south, indicating a bearish setup.  The daily moving averages (5-day and 10-day) seen here are also pointing south, and the broader outlook remains bearish as long as bitcoin is trapped inside the falling channel. Currently, BTC is having a tough time crossing the 5-day MA, currently located at $6,857. Bargain hunters will likely enter the market after the short-term moving averages have bottomed out. While charts show early signs of bear exhaustion, the long-term outlook is still poor for the bulls, as indicated by the pennant breakdown and the bearish crossover between 5-month and 10-month MAs.

" Signs are beginning to emerge that bitcoin’s sell-off today may be overextended. After hitting a 70-day low of $6,133 on CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI) hit a level (26.4) last seen in August of 2016, according to data from the Bitfinex exchange. The relative strength index, or RSI, is used for identifying overbought and oversold conditions of an asset by “comparing the magnitude of recent gains and losses over a specified time period to measure speed and change of price.” When such levels are hit, the indicator suggests price action is approaching a level below the asset’s true value, where a price bounce tends to occur.  BTC/USD rarely hits oversold levels (<30) in the daily time frame, but when it does, price has historically performed well for the bulls.

February 6th was the last time RSI levels were below 30, and at that time, prices rallied from $6,000 to $11,788 in just two weeks, resulting in a ~96 percent gain.

Prior to that, on August 14th, 2016, BTC registered an RSI level just above 26 when the price showed $563 on Bitfinex. Even through today, the price of bitcoin has not gone below $563 and current levels represent a ~980% price increase.

 But while the oversold indicators tend to signal downtrend exhaustion, bulls might want to still proceed with caution before celebrating as bitcoin’s daily RSI has reached lower levels. According to Bitfinex data, the lowest level recorded since 2013 was 16.1 on August 18th, 2015. Bitcoin image via Shutterstock",2018-06-13
" Bitcoin is still looking south, having hit four-month lows today, but the bearish momentum may wane due to short-term oversold conditions, the technical charts indicate. More bears joined the party in the U.S. session Tuesday after the cryptocurrency failed to cross twin resistance at $6,859 (50-hour moving average (MA) and 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement). As a result, the price fell to $6,370 on Bitfinex today, the lowest level since Feb. 6. At press time, bitcoin was slightly higher at $6,453. The drop to the four-month low has bolstered the already bearish technical setup and raised the odds of a sell-off to $6,000 (February low). However, the bears may take a breather over the next day or two, as the relative strength index (RSI) is hovering at the key bullish reversal zone, and bitcoin could hold around support at $6,400 or possibly see a minor corrective rally.  Currently, the RSI is holding below 30.00. Historical data shows BTC stages a “V”-shaped recovery every time the RSI drops to or below 30.00. However, things may pan out differently this time, as long-term technical charts are biased to the bears.  The downside break of the pennant (bearish continuation pattern) indicates scope for a drop below the February low of $6,000. Further, on the weekly chart, the RSI fell below key support of 53.00 in February, signaling a long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change and is currently hovering below 50.00 (still in bearish territory). Clearly, the bears now have more say in determining the BTC/USD exchange rate. So, while the cryptocurrency may make a brief rally, courtesy of the oversold conditions, a major recovery will likely remain elusive. Bitcoin on chart image via Shutterstock",2018-06-13
" The price of bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell to its lowest point since April 1 on Tuesday. Bitcoin’s value slid to $6,455.92 during the afternoon trading session, dropping more than $280 in the span of two hours, according to data from CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. This represents the lowest figure since the start of April when the BPI registered a low of $6,443. The charts suggest a support of $6,436 – if current levels are broken, the next major support is $6,000, borne from the lows from early February of this year. As of press time, the BPI is reporting a price of $6,523.86.  As of press time, bitcoin is down 5.82 percent in the last 24 hours. Further, on a year-to-date basis, bitcoin is reporting a 60 percent depreciation overall. Tuesday’s session saw downward developments for other major cryptocurrencies as well. For instance, litecoin, the world’s sixth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is now approaching $98 – a price not seen since December of last year. EOS is also down 12% on the day, representing a total decline of 34% since June 4th. Meanwhile, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is just over $280 billion, according to data published by CoinMarketCap. Image via Shutterstock",2018-06-12
" Bitcoin (BTC) is looking to regain poise after its drop to two-month lows on Sunday, but the recovery will likely be short-lived, the technical charts indicate. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,825 on Bitfinex – up 3 percent from the two-month low of $6,619. The recovery could be associated with extreme oversold conditions highlighted by the relative strength index (RSI) yesterday and could be extended further in the next 24 hours. However, crossing $7,000 in a convincing manner will be easier said than done, as the area around the psychological hurdle is packed with key technical resistance lines. Further, the long duration charts have turned bearish, so holding on to gains above $7,000 will be a challenge for BTC’s bulls. Hence, the recovery could turn out to be a dead cat bounce – a temporary recovery in a bear market that is followed by a resumption of the downtrend.  On the way higher, BTC could face stiff resistance at May 29 low of 7,040 (former support turned resistance). Interestingly, the pennant floor (former support) is also lined up at $7,040. Further, a key Fibonacci retracement level is located around $7,000, as seen in the chart below.  The 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the latest leg down in prices is $7,008. What’s more, the cryptocurrency is struggling to find acceptance above $6,859 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement). The failure to beat a less important Fibonacci hurdle only indicates how tough it could be for bitcoin to scale $7,008 (38.2 percent Fibonacci hurdle). The bearish moving averages could also complicate the recovery in bitcoin prices. The 50-hour, 100-hour and 200-hour moving averages (MAs) are all trending south indicating a bearish setup. Meanwhile, the long duration charts are biased to the bears too.  The bearish crossover between the 5-month and 10-month MA also indicates the tide has turned in favor of the bears.  As discussed yesterday, the downside break of the pennant pattern has revived the bear market and opened the doors for a drop below the February low of $6,000. The pennant breakdown also adds credence to BTC’s bearish close below the 50-week MA in May. And, last but not the least, the charts also show there is a lot of space to the downside as a major support is seen directly at $6,000 (Feb low). A violation there would open up downside towards $4,496 (100-week moving average) and $3,300 (trendline drawn from the August 2015 low and March 2017 low).

" The bitcoin market has come alive in the last 36 hours, with the bears gaining the upper hand and now aiming for fresh 2018 lows below $6,000. The cryptocurrency dropped nearly 10 percent on Sunday, hitting a two-month low of $6,619 on Bitfinex, having spent the last two weeks trading in the narrow range of $7,000–$7,800. Across the media, the price drop has been put down to a hack on South Korean exchange Coinrail, revealed Sunday, and renewed concerns regarding security at cryptocurrency exchanges. However, a big move was expected anyway – as an extended period of consolidation or low volatility is often followed by a sharp move on either side  – and prices started falling Saturday, so the theft of ERC-20 tokens at a minor exchange seems an unlikely cause. Either way, the technical studies now spell trouble for bitcoin. The convincing move below $7,000 marks a downside break of the four-month-long narrowing price range and has opened the doors for a drop below $6,000 (Feb. 6 low). As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,773 on Bitfinex – down 6.4 percent in the last 24 hours.  The cryptocurrency created a pennant in the last four months, signaling that the sell-off from the December record high of $19,891 had ended at $6,000. An upside break of the pennant would have signaled a long-run bearish-to-bullish trend change. However, prices closed (as per UTC) well below the pennant support yesterday, implying a downside break of the pennant pattern and a resumption of the sell-off from the December high. The chart also shows a bearish crossover between 5-week and 10-week moving averages (MAs). The relative strength index is also biased bearish (below 50.00). So, bitcoin looks set to extend the decline over the next couple of weeks. On the downside, support is seen at $6,000 (February low), $4,496 (100-week moving average) and $3,300 (trendline drawn from the August 2015 low and March 2017 low). While the bears appear to be in control, minor corrective rallies could be seen, as the cryptocurrency looks oversold as per short duration chart studies.  The extreme oversold conditions as shown by the relative strength index could put a temporary bid under bitcoin. However, the long-term bearish breakdown as seen in the weekly chart will likely restrict the corrective rally to around $7,200. Bitcoin and chart image via Shutterstock",2018-06-11
" The price of bitcoin dropped $500 in a single hour Sunday to hit a two-month low below $6,700. According to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is now changing hands at $6,718, up slightly after reaching a daily low of $6,647, its lowest total since April 10. Indeed, data shows that over the last 24-hours bitcoin failed to find solid support in the $7,470 zone, before plummeting 11 percent to $6,647.  For traders, this means bitcoin’s two-month uptrend appears to be in question. Trading at around $6,700, bitcoin is now within striking distance of its 2018 low of $5,947 set in February. With the bitcoin price declining, so too has the market for all cryptocurrencies, with now stands at $295 billion, down from $340 billion yesterday. The figure also marked a two-month low for the broader market. Nearly all cryptocurrencies listed show a 10-20 percent decline in price over the last 24-hours.

" Bitcoin has been squeezed into an increasingly narrow range for more than two weeks and is now experiencing volatility not seen for eight months. As a result, it’s looking likely that bitcoin could soon make a strong move, but the direction it will take when that happens is less than clear. Since May 24, the cryptocurrency has been restricted to a range of $7,000–$7,800 range, which is already very tight, but the price has barely moved in the last 36 hours, likely indicating an indecisive market. Daily volatility, as indicated by the spread between the daily price high and daily price low, fell to $107.63 on Thursday – the lowest level since Oct. 2, 2017 and down 86 percent from the 2018 average of $793, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). As of writing, prices on CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) are at $7,580, marking around a $100 drop over 24 hours. if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""r9MYq""]={},window.datawrapper[""r9MYq""].embedDeltas={""100"":474.020834,""200"":420.020834,""300"":420.020834,""400"":394.020834,""500"":394.020834,""700"":394.020834,""800"":394.020834,""900"":394.020834,""1000"":394.020834},window.datawrapper[""r9MYq""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-r9MYq""),window.datawrapper[""r9MYq""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""r9MYq""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""r9MYq""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""r9MYq""==b)window.datawrapper[""r9MYq""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""});
While all is calm now it may not continue that way for long, as an extended period of sideways action is often followed by a violent move on either side. As technical theory states, the wider the range and the longer the period of the consolidation, the more violent a breakout tends to be. So, bitcoin could see a speedy $800 move very soon – in either direction.  Bitcoin had looked set up for a major bullish move earlier this week, following an upside break of the falling channel. Now the bull’s failure to cross resistance at $7,780 has left the doors open for the bears to make a comeback. As a result, the probability of bitcoin ending the period of consolidation with a downside break is the more likely of the two possibilities. Indeed, prices are starting to drop at press time.

" Still stuck in a narrowing price range, BTC could soon rise to resistance above $8,000 if the bulls are able to leap the 50-week moving average hurdle. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,770 on Bitfinex, having been stuck in a narrowing price range (pennant) for months now. Defense of $7,000 last week and the 9.3 percent rise since then have neutralized the immediate bearish outlook and got investors talking about a possible rally to pennant resistance at $8,870. While that target may appear far-fetched, it may be put to test if bitcoin can first scale the key 50-week moving average (MA) resistance (currently located at $7,819) in a convincing manner.  As seen in the chart above, BTC narrowly avoided a downside (bearish) break of the narrowing price range last week, turning higher from $7,040. A bearish breakdown would have signaled a resumption of the sell-off from the record high of $19,891 and could have pushed BTC below $6,000 (February low). However, the subsequent rally to close to $7,700 has neutralized that threat. While it’s still too early to say that bitcoin is now aiming for $8,880 (pennant resistance), the probability would rise sharply if we see an aggressive run above the significant resistance of the 50-week MA. Such a move would invalidate the long-run bearish reversal indicated by the weekly close in the third week of May below the moving average. A move above the 50-week MA would also need to be backed by a solid rise in trading volumes to break out of the pennant. In a promising sign for the bulls, the daily chart below shows that bitcoin is positioned for a convincing break above the 50-week moving average hurdle.  The upside break of the falling channel seen earlier this week indicates a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change. The 5- and 10-day MAs are also biased to the bulls, as is the higher lows pattern indicated by the rising trendline. So, a break above the immediate resistance at $7,780 (June 3 high) could yield a quisignificantck rally to over $8,000. The bullish move would also add credence to “6th of the month” theory, which had hinted at a major bullish reversal based on an alternating monthly cycle.

" Bitcoin (BTC) continues to operate in bearish territory and only a move above $7,780 would put the bulls back into the driver’s seat, the technical charts indicate. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,591 on Bitfinex. The cryptocurrency was on the defensive yesterday, courtesy of a failed breakout and a rising-wedge breakdown and looked set to re-test the recent low of $7,040. However, sellers ran out of steam at $7,372, as indicated by a doji candle and prices moved back above $7,600 in the Asian session today. While the exact reason behind the bear exhaustion is unclear, it fits with a recently observed pattern that bitcoin changes direction in favor of the weaker side on, or close to, the sixth day of every month. The cryptocurrency is down more than 30 percent from the recent high of $9,990, meaning the bulls are on the back foot. So bitcoin could turn higher today, as indicated by the historical pattern. Furthermore, the fear of getting trapped on the wrong side of the market may have forced the bears to stay on the sidelines, despite the false breakout and rising-wedge breakdown. That said, the cryptocurrency is still treading waters in the bearish territory, as seen in the chart below.  The bearish rising-wedge breakdown remains valid as long as bitcoin keeps trading below $7,780 (June 3 high). So, the downside is still in play and the sell-off could accelerate if the support at $7,372 is breached. However, the 50-candle moving average (MA) has started rising in favor of the bulls and the 100-candle MA has flatlined (shed bearish bias), so the odds of a break below $7,372 are low.

" A major reprieve just may be in the offing for the battered bitcoin bulls in the next 36 hours – if, that is, historical patterns repeat themselves. Intriguingly, the cryptocurrency tends to take a significant change of direction on the sixth day of every month, or at least it has so far in 2018. Having topped out in the $20,000 neighborhood in mid-December 2017, the cryptocurrency fell to a 2018 low of $6,000 on Feb. 6. Since then, the cryptocurrency has been restricted to a narrowing price range, as indicated by the triangle pattern in the chart below. What’s more interesting is that major price highs and lows over that time have formed around the sixth day of every month.  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows: Clearly, the tide rebounds in favor of the weaker side on, or close to, the sixth day of every month. As of writing, bitcoin is trading at $7,433 on Bitfinex – down 34 percent from the bearish reversal point of $9,990, dated May 6, meaning the bulls are currently on the defensive. Going by the historical pattern, the cryptocurrency seems likely to turn higher in the next 36 hours or so. In this case, bitcoin could revisit triangle (narrowing price range) resistance, currently located at $9,225. On the other hand, long-term technical studies are biased to the bears, which was not the case on previous occasions. For instance, the cryptocurrency has found acceptance below the 50-week moving average for the first time since 2015. Further, a 5-month and 10-month moving average (MA) bearish crossover recently occurred for the first time in four years. So, as always, nothing is guaranteed when it comes to bitcoin price movements. But, just possibly, the cryptocurrency could pick up a strong bid tomorrow, in line with the historical pattern.  Even so, it would be too early to call a bull reversal, given the bearish long-term technical developments, and traders would want to see more evidence – such as a high volume break above the weekly high of $7,779 – before assuming the bulls were back in charge. Calendar image via Shutterstock",2018-06-05
" Bitcoin’s retreat from Sunday’s high of $7,779 has poured cold water over the bull mood generated by the weekend’s positive price action and neutralized the immediate outlook. BTC closed on Sunday (as per UTC) above a key falling trendline resistance level, signaling a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change. A bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving average (MA) also favored a short-term positive price action. However, bitcoin suffered a rising wedge breakdown (bearish pattern) in the U.S. hours on Monday, signaling that the corrective rally from the recent low of $7,040 had ended. In the end, the failed breakout was no surprise, as low trading volumes had warned of a bull trap. At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at a four-day low of $7,426 on Bitfinex, down 2.5 percent over 24 hours.  The above chart shows that bitcoin is back inside a falling channel and risks a quick drop to $6,980 (triangle support) if the bulls fail to defend the support at $7,260 (May 24 low). Further, the rising-wedge breakdown as seen in the 4-hour chart below, also indicates the corrective rally has ended and prices could soon revisit the recent low of $7,040.  Still, the overall outlook may be more neutral, with bitcoin creating a doji candle on the 4-hour chart above, signaling indecision in the marketplace. If the current 4-hour candle closes below $7,732, it could bolster the already bearish technicals (failed breakout). Meanwhile, if the current 4-hour candle closes above $7,500, bitcoin could revisit $7,700. Tug-of-war image via Shutterstock",2018-06-05
" Bitcoin looks primed for a move to $8,000, but low trading volumes point to the risk of a bull trap. The cryptocurrency broke through a key descending trendline (drawn through the May 6 high to the May 21 high) on Sunday, adding credence to last Tuesday’s bullish outside-day candle and signaling a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change. However, at the same time, daily trading volume fell 1.77 percent to $4.85 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Further, rolling 24-hour trading volume currently stands at $4.95 billion – down 22.5 percent from the current quarterly average of $6.38 billion. Low volume is a cause for concern for the bulls, as it is widely considered a sign that the market is approaching a peak; that is, the rally will be short-lived. Hence, a slight pullback seen today does not come as a surprise. At time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,591 on Bitfinex – down 2 percent from the previous day’s (UTC) close of $7,718.  The bullish outside-day candle followed by a bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs), and an upside break of the falling trendline, indicate scope for a rally to $8,000. However, the decline in trading volume over the last seven days puts a question market on the sustainability of the corrective rally from $7,040 (May 29 low) to $7,779 (Sunday’s high).  On the 4-hour chart, trading volume has picked up as prices fell back to $7,549 from the high of $7,764. The anemic trading volume during the price rally and the later increase in trading volume during negative price action indicates a high probability of a downside break of the rising wedge pattern. In such a case, bitcoin risks falling back to last week’s low of $7,040. Trapped businessman image via Shutterstock",2018-06-04
" A long-term price indicator has turned bearish for the first time in four years, threatening to impede continued gains in bitcoin’s price. Despite the rally late in the month, the cryptocurrency dropped 19 percent in May, according to Bitfinex data, pushing the 5-month moving average (MA) below the 10-month moving average for the first time since June 2014. The bearish moving average crossover validates the argument that long-term bull market has ended and indicates scope for further losses. The monthly chart also shows BTC fell below $7,698 – the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $162 (2015 low) to $19,891 (2017 high) – last month, bolstering the already bearish technical setup. However, the 4-hour chart is distinctly more bullish, indicating that gains could continue in the short-term.  Going strictly by the monthly chart, BTC could drop to the immediate support of $6,000 (February low) and possibly extend the decline further towards $4,384 (78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement). However, bitcoin had to drop 19 percent in May to push the 5-month MA below the 10-month MA. So, it’s likely the bears have run out of steam, at least for the short-term. Thus, a corrective rally could be in the offing before the bearish effect of the long-term moving average crossover is felt. Indeed, the short duration chart does show a scope for a rally to $7,800.  Bitcoin created another higher low (bullish pattern) as it recovered from the low of $7,414 yesterday. The 50-candle MA has now shed bearish bias) and the RSI is above 50.00 (bullish territory) and rising. The price action, when viewed against the backdrop of Tuesday’s bullish outside-day candle and the bullish price-RSI divergence, indicates scope for a rally to $7,818 (falling trendline resistance).

" Mining hardware giant Bitmain has been criticized over one of its latest mining products, the AntMiner B3, with Chinese users making allegations about its marketing tactics and quality control. According to a blog post from the AntMiner’s official WeChat account, the new product – dedicated to mining BTM, the native token of the Bytom blockchain – was launched on April 25, one day after the Bytom team launched its mainnet. Priced at 17,000 Chinese yuan (or $2,600) per unit, the first batch of 25,000 B3 miners was notably sold out in seconds after commencement of the sale. While the AntMiner B3’s official specifications tout a computing power of 750 hashes per second, complaints from the first batch of buyers in China soon emerged, alleging that Bitmain had significantly exaggerated the product’s power capability in its marketing. According to a local news source, the dispute arose after an initial test by miners in China said the AntMiner B3 can only produce 500–600 hashes per second, a difference that critically reduces their calculated profits from an 47 BTM per day to as low as single digit production. As more complaints have emerged in the local community over the past several weeks, miners have moved to form groups on social messaging app WeChat and have shared their findings on the mining device on Chinese Q&A site Zhihu. Other allegations that have since then been circulating over the social media include suspicions that Bitmain is using secondhand components to manufacture the B3. According to one post on Zhihu, users commented that the fan of their supposed brand new AntMiner B3 was covered with dust, which could potentially explain the reported weak computing performance. Subsequently, a dedicated Weibo account that claims to protect the rights of the B3 buyers was also created on May 19, in a bid to demand refunds from the mining giant. According to a post from the activists’ Weibo page, a group of B3 purchasers visited Bitmain’s office in Beijing on Monday to discuss a solution to the issue. While the group apparently comprised of fewer than 10 people, the meeting saw local policemen present to ensure the conversation was peaceful. Based on a news report from Sina, miners from the group said Bitmain expressed willingness to fix products that have hashing power issues, but would not consider refunding customers. The firm is instead open to the idea of resolving the matter through the legal process, as per the report. While Bitmain has yet to respond to CoinDesk’s enquiry for further comment, the company was quoted in another local news report Thursday conceding there are problems with some B3s. However, Bitmain clarified that devices with issues only represent one percent of production so far, based on its internal investigations. The company also denied the accusation that it was selling secondhand products. In response to the accusation that it exaggerated the specs of the mining machine in its marketing, Bitmain commented: “Mining machines are in essence investment products … The profit and the price of the token adjust based on the market dynamics. As such nothing could guaranteed by any company or any individual.” Miners image via Shutterstock",2018-06-01
" Bitcoin (BTC) is working its way through the key supply zone above $7,500 and could test resistance at $7,870 in the next 24 hours, the technical charts indicate. The cryptocurrency looked primed for a corrective rally yesterday, having created a bullish outside-day candle on Tuesday. However, the bulls had a tough time absorbing supply around 50-candle moving average (MA) on the 4-hour chart, located yesterday at $7,550. The repeated failure to beat the moving average hurdle ended in a downside break of the diamond pattern. The subsequent sell-off ran out of steam at $7,270, and led to a convincing move above the 50-candle MA, seen today at $7,441. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,535 on Bitfinex, up 0.6 percent over 24 hours, and looks set to test the falling trendline resistance located at $7,870.  The recovery from $7,270 to $7,570 has established a higher low (bullish pattern), which adds credence to Tuesday’s bullish outside-day candle and bullish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence. Hence, BTC could test supply around $7,870 – resistance of trendline sloping downwards from the May 6 high and May 21 high. It also means the cryptocurrency will likely peep above the all-important 50-week MA, currently located at $7,711. However, only a weekly close (Sunday’s close as per UTC) above that level would signal bearish invalidation. Weekly chart  As seen in the chart above, the last weekly candle had closed below the 50-week MA for the first time since October 2015, in theory indicating the end of the long-term bull run. Despite the bullish set up, there is merit in being cautious as the major moving averages – 50, 100 and 200 – on the 4-hour chart are also biased to the bears, as is the 10-day MA.

" Bitcoin’s (BTC) bulls have staged a defense after nearly a month of losses, but a short-term bullish trend reversal is not yet confirmed, the technical charts indicate. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is up 5 percent at $7,487 on Bitfinex, having clocked a four-day high of $7,560 earlier today. A minor corrective rally had been expected, courtesy of a bullish price-relative strength index divergence in the short duration charts seen over the last two days. Further, the resulting bullish outside-day candle engulfed the price action seen on Monday and Tuesday, and has neutralized the immediate bearish outlook.  As the name suggests, the bullish outside-day indicates a bearish-to-bullish trend change. However, analysts and traders usually wait for confirmation – positive follow-through before calling a reversal. So, a short-term bullish trend reversal would be confirmed if bitcoin takes out the descending (bearish) 10-day moving average (MA) hurdle in a convincing manner. Currently, the 10-day MA is located at $7,562 and is capping the upside in prices, as seen in the chart above. Meanwhile, the 50-candle MA hurdle in the 4-hour chart below is also proving a tough nut to crack.  A high volume break above the 50-candle MA of $7,520 could see bitcoin attack the descending trendline hurdle, currently located at $7,930. That said, prices will likely revisit $7,100 if bulls are unable to cross the key moving average hurdle in the next few hours. The chart also shows the major moving averages (50,100 and 200) are trending south, a lingering bearish setup. So, a convincing break above the 50-candle MA will be easier said than done.

" Scammers are a nuisance. Perhaps nowhere else within the cryptocurrency space have scammers become more frustrating than on crypto Twitter. The social media site has been overtaken with accounts impersonating notable figures and businesses promising tens of thousands of bitcoin or ether or XRP, in return for users merely sending a small amount of a cryptocurrency to their accounts in return. While it might seem intuitive that these giveaways are suspect, the fraudsters are playing to people’s FOMO (fear of missing out), but also the language and cultural barriers that exist within the diverse, global community. Indeed, crypto aficionados of all kinds – not just the most prominent founders, but also low-profile developers and newly announced ICO issuers and nearly everyone in between – wake up every morning, scouring their Twitter accounts and reporting the abuse to the social networking giant. Yet, it seems there isn’t an easy way to stop the shakedowns. It’s led many crypto visionaries to go about getting Twitter’s blue check mark, a sign that an account has been verified and is therefore supposedly more legitimate. But even that has proved manipulable. Airing frustration towards the chaos that crypto Twitter has devolved into, a well-known cryptocurrency advocate known as Thomas ‘Mad Bitcoins’ Hunt tweeted: “Your system is broken. Allowing users to choose the same name and image as other users is a mistake that leads to fraud. Change your system. End this fraud.” But still the chaos has continued (if not gotten worse), and many crypto enthusiasts are deciding if you can’t beat ’em, you might as well laugh at ’em. As such, they’re tweeting out the most egregious interplay between themselves and the scammers, and sometimes one con man to the next. The instances of impersonation have gotten so bad, that many crypto visionaries have added language to their profiles stating “[Not giving away ETH/BTC]” – as if it was their middle names. But, although it could seem counterintuitive, as these fraudsters merely copy and paste the name and image onto their scam accounts, that language too has carried over. Generally, these accounts comment their giveway images under a post from the real person they’re trying to impersonate, hoping to prey off users that aren’t looking closely at the handles, which at times are only one letter off from the originals. And as scammers have become more sophisticated, they’ve taken to blocking the person they’re trying to impersonate, so that that person can’t see their posts, report it and get shut down by Twitter.  Just like the scammers above try to confuse users by putting their fake posts side-by-side the people they’re impersonating, other scammers have jumped on posts where many people are mentioned. Recently, South African crypto exchange, iceCUBED, tweeted out a list of crypto notables for what has become known as “Follow Fridays” – whereby a user tweets out people that their followers should follow. I was featured alongside folks like monero lead maintainer Riccardo Spagni, Lightning Labs founder Elizabeth Spark and litecoin creator Charlie Lee (I know, I’m not worthy). Right under that post, though, another user by the same name, but with a different handle, posted about an ETH giveaway. And in that way, some unsuspecting users could think that not only the exchange but also the people tagged in the post support the promotion.  While journalists might seem strange characters to impersonate (especially since I’ve written about not being a crypto millionaire), it has become a popular move since they typically have significant followings of users of all skill levels, including newbs to the cryptocurrency scene who might not be well-versed on the state of the industry. Another way scammers (whose accounts generally have only a couple followers and whose only tweets are the ones about the giveaways) are trying to trick users is by creating more personal accounts. For instance, a Twitter user named Dennis Parker was recently impersonated. The account copied and pasted his name and picture but the bio was very different. Whereas the real Dennis Parker’s bio just says, “Bitcoin Maximalist,” the scam account (which was still active at the time of this writing) says, “Foodie, Editor, Water Protector, Wine Connoisseur, Unwashed Mass. I own 25 hoolahoops.” As Parker tweeted: “My scam accounts are getting personal.” Not only that, but scammers have also gone to other lengths to try and bilk users out of their crypto. Notable venture capital investor Tim Draper tweeted about one of his impersonators asking his followers for funds in exchange for mining bitcoin for them. Most people in the crypto scene know Neeraj Agrawal, the communication lead at Washington D.C.-based lobbying group Coin Center and also a meme god on crypto Twitter. Lesser-known is NeerajKAgrawal7, who recently replied to an offering of ETH with one word – “scam.” While that might not seem particularly surprising, what’s absurd is that the response came from one of Agrawal’s imposters, not Agrawal himself. As Agrawal tweeted, “My ether scammer is calling out other ether scammers.”  In a similar instance, an account posing as Bruce Fenton (the thought leader and investor in the cryptocurrency space who founded Satoshi Roundtable) commented with its own crypto giveaway on the giveaway post from a fake Mad Bitcoins. Speaking to the event, Mad Bitcoins tweeted: “It’s a beautiful cycle of spam Twitter and you should make it stop!” As mentioned above, many of the most acclaimed people in the cryptocurrency space deal with insane amounts of scam accounts. Case in point, Charlie Shrem, the founder of now-defunct early bitcoin exchange BitInstant and now an adviser for several blockchain projects, tweeted recently about all the scam accounts under his name. He said: “I do give away stuff from time to time, but will never ask you to send me something first.” The tweet was accompanied by images which display just how rampant the scam accounts have become.  Another crypto character that gets impersonated quite a bit is John McAfee, who became famous after launching the popular anti-virus software and is now promoting ICOs on Twitter for a fee. Yet, many crypto enthusiasts might not sympathize with McAfee since they see his new “job” as dubious. In fact, McAfee’s latest ICO-promoting tweet featured Pink Taxi Coin, a dubious ICO project with a plagiarized white paper and website, among other red flags. While these impersonators have become a scourge on crypto Twitter, some have taken to joking about how having a scammer impersonate them is a way to display that they’re popular. A prominent parody account in the space, Swift on Security, said, after a fraudster impersonated the account, “I’ve made it. I’ve finally made it.” As such, Kevin Pham, who became a staple of crypto Twitter this year, tweeted (after being impersonated): “Fuck blue checks. Having a scam account is the free market signalling you’re a somebody on Crypto Twitter!”  Magic trick image via Shutterstock",2018-05-30
" Concerns over high price volatility have prompted prosecutors in Germany to make an emergency sale of seized cryptocurrencies worth over €12 million (around $14 million). Local news source Der Tagesspiegel reported Monday that Bavarian prosecutors ordered the sale on Feb. 20. At the time, bitcoin’s price had rebounded to nearly $10,000 after hitting a yearly low of $5,947 on Feb. 6, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Taking nearly two months to complete, the sale reportedly disposed of 1,312 bitcoins, 1,399 bitcoin cash, 1,312 bitcoin gold and 220 ether via over 1,600 transactions on a German trading platform. The cryptocurrencies were all seized during two ongoing investigations being conducted by Bavarian cybercrime agencies. Although the prosecutor has not yet brought charges in the two cases, German legislation allows for emergency sales if assets seized in ongoing investigations face an immediate threat of loss of value, according to the report. “Since all cryptocurrencies are exposed to the risk of high price fluctuations or even total loss, the Bayern Central Office of Cybercrime ordered an emergency sale,” the state prosecutors explained in the report. Following the sale, the office has yet to determine how to handle the proceeds, since it remains unclear whether the prosecutor will move forward with the investigations. At the end of last year, the Central Office of Cybercrime in Germany’s Hesse state also made a notable sale of 126 bitcoins confiscated over several years through investigations on the darknet. At the time, bitcoin’s price was around its all-time-high at $20,000, which resulted in proceeds of nearly $2.3 million, according to an earlier report from Der Tagesspiegel.

" Bitcoin (BTC) risks falling to the key support level of $6,900, having failed to capitalize on signs of weakening bearish momentum yesterday. The cryptocurrency’s technical charts saw a doji candle on Sunday, signaling short-term bearish exhaustion. However, a corrective rally remained elusive as bitcoin ran into offers above $7,400 and closed (as per UTC) at $7,143 – the lowest daily close since April 12, according to Bitfinex. Prices continued to drop today, with bitcoin hitting a 7-week low of $7,040 this morning. At time of writing, the price was at $7,130. The losses signal a continuation of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 and indicate scope for a drop to $6,900 – a level that the bulls need to defend at all cost. If they can’t, prices may go as low as $5,000.  BTC created a bearish outside-day candle on Monday. These occur when a high is above the previous day’s high and the low is below the previous day’s low. In simple terms, it means trading on Monday started with optimism and ended with pessimism. The bearish outside-day usually indicates a bullish-to-bearish trend change. However, when viewed against the backdrop of Sunday’s doji candle, the bearish outside-day signals revival/continuation of the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990. The above chart also shows the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MA) are trending south in favor of the bears. The relative strength index (RSI) has dropped to 30.00, indicating oversold conditions. According to historical data, bitcoin climbs every time the RSI on the daily chart drops to or below 30.00. However, the historical pattern may not come into play this time, as BTC’s long-term technical studies have turned in favor of the bears. For instance, the weekly RSI is below 50.00 (in the bearish territory). Further, BTC recently closed below the 50-week MA for the first time since 2015, adding credence to the argument the long-run bull market is over. Meanwhile, the 5-month and 10-month MAs are beginning to slope downwards in favor of the bears. As a result, it’s likely that BTC will drop to $6,900 (triangle support) soon – although it may not happen in the next 24 hours as the short-duration chart shows a temporary bullish setup.  BTC has created lower lows in the last 48 hours, but the RSI has not followed suit – a bullish divergence that indicates scope for a minor corrective rally.

" While the odds are still stacked in favor of bitcoin’s bears, a level of indecision looks to be creeping in, according to the technical charts. The cryptocurrency fell to a 6.5-week low of $7,142 on Bitfinex earlier today, having breached the 50-week moving average (MA) support for the first time since 2015. Amid the continued drop in prices, though, the charts show a doji candle formed yesterday, indicating that the bears may be running out of steam and a short-term rally could be on the cards. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,210 – down 16.58 percent from the last Monday’s high of $8,644.  The pennant breakdown, a bearish continuation pattern, on the 4-hour chart indicates the sell-off from the last Monday’s high of $8,644 has resumed and opened the doors to $6,800 (target as per the measured height method: pennant range subtracted from breakout price). The 50-candle, 100-candle, and 200-candle moving averages (MAs) are aligned in favor of a further drop in prices.  On the daily chart, the 5-day and 10-day MAs are trending south, indicating a short-term bearish setup. A series of lower highs and lower lows also indicates the bears are in control. The relative strength index (RSI) is holding slightly above 30.00, signaling just enough room for another $200 drop in BTC prices.  The first weekly close below the 50-week MA in nearly three years only validates the argument that the long-term bull market has ended. The relative strength index (RSI) has also rolled over in favor of the bears, while the 5-week MA is set to cross the 10-week MA from above, signaling a bearish crossover. Clearly, BTC is on the defensive, still, there is merit in being cautious as the cryptocurrency created a small doji candle on Sunday (as seen in the daily chart) at the key 76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $7,209, indicating bear indecision in the marketplace. Thus, a minor corrective rally could be in the offing if bitcoin posts gain today (bullish doji reversal). Chart image via Shutterstock",2018-05-28
" Bitcoin risks closing below the 50-week moving average (MA) – an important long-term support not breached for over two-and-a-half years. With the bears already on the offensive following the recent sell-off, prices are likely to suffer if bitcoin closes on Sunday below the key support, currently seen at $7,611. More worryingly for the bulls, since the cryptocurrency has not traded below the 50-week MA since October 2015, acceptance below that level would only add credence to the argument that the long-term bull run has ended. As of writing, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,449 on Bitfinex, having dropped below the 50-week MA on May 23.  As seen on the chart above, the long-term moving average had acted as a strong support in the first quarter. BTC found strong bids in mid April following the repeated failure (marked by a circle) on the part of the bears to penetrate the 50-week MA. Subsequently, the rally from the 50-week MA to $9,990 (May 5 high) reinforced the moving average as a strong long-term support. Hence, a downside break would raise the odds of a slide to fresh 2017 lows below $6,000. Looking ahead, price chart analysis suggests that bitcoin is likely to end the week below the key $7,611 level. To start with, the weekly relative strength index (RSI) is below 50.00 (in the bearish territory) and trending south in favor of the bears. The RSI has also found acceptance below the key support zone of 53.55–55.00, which only strengthens the bear case. Meanwhile, the daily chart below also shows scope for a drop below $7,000.  The bears currently have the upper hand, as indicated by the lower highs and lower lows pattern, downside break of the channel, downward sloping (bearish) 5-day and 10-day MAs. The RSI is holding below 50.00 (in the bearish territory), but well above 30.00 (oversold region), indicating room for sell-off to $6,870 (triangle support).  Despite the bullish price RSI divergence on the hourly chart, BTC failed to cross the falling trendline hurdle, underscoring the strong bearish sentiment in the market.

" Bitcoin (BTC) is trading on the defensive today, having dropped 16 percent over the last three days. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,270 on Bitfinex, down 6.5 percent in the last 24 hours, and could extend the slide further to $7,000 in the next 24 hours. The cryptocurrency closed (as per UTC) at $7,494 yesterday – its lowest daily close since April 12 – and looked oversold as per the relative strength index (RSI) in the hourly and 4-hour chart. A resulting corrective rally ran info offers above $7,700 earlier today and prices fell to a 6-week low of $7,352 at 08:30 UTC. The failure on the part of the bulls to produce a notable corrective rally despite oversold conditions indicates that bearish sentiment is currently strong.  The downside break of the bear flag, a bearish continuation pattern, indicates the minor corrective rally from the low of $7,402 has ended and BTC could drop to $7,000 (target as per the measured height method). The 50-hour, 100-hour and 200-hour moving averages (MAs) are biased to the bears. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) has dropped close to the oversold region (30.00), but is holding well above the lows seen yesterday, indicating there is enough room for a drop to $7,000.  BTC closed (as per UTC) yesterday below $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement) in a convincing manner, signaling a bullish-to-bearish trend change. Note that a break below the 61.8 percent Fib is widely considered a final confirmation of a bearish trend reversal. The chart also shows a bearish downside break of the falling channel, while the 5-day and 10-day MAs are trending south, also in favor of the bears. The relative strength index is holding below 50.00 – well above 30.00 (oversold zone), signaling scope for further losses. Chart image via Shutterstock",2018-05-24
" Following bitcoin’s recent losses, a key long-term trend indicator is looking increasingly bearish. Notably, the five-month moving average (MA) has rolled over in favor of the bears and looks set to cut the 10-month MA from above – a bearish crossover that hasn’t been seen since June 2014. If that occurs it could be a worrying signal for the long-term price outlook. Back then, following an identical crossover in June 2014, the cryptocurrency subsequently dropped by 70 percent (from $580 to $166) in the seven months leading up to January 2015. This time around, the bearish crossover will likely occur at the turn of the month, if bitcoin extends the current decline towards the $7,000 mark, and would open the doors for a deeper sell-off towards the $5,000 mark.  Currently, the five-month MA is seen at $8,916 and the 10-month MA is located at $8,379, according to Bitfinex data. Meanwhile, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,820 – down almost 5 percent in the last 24 hours.  The observed lower-highs and lower-lows pattern (marked by circles) and the downward sloping 5-day and 10-day MAs indicate a bearish setup. The chart also shows a bearish crossover between the 10-day and 50-day MAs. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) is below 50.00 (in the bearish territory), but holding well above 30.00 (oversold territory), indicating enough room for a sell-off towards $7,000.  Acceptance below the 50-week MA, currently seen at $7,620, would only bolster the already bearish daily chart technicals and increase the odds of the bearish five-month/10-month MA crossover. The 50-week MA worked as a strong support in April, so a break below that level could yield a sharp sell-off. Down arrow image via Shutterstock",2018-05-23
" Bitcoin’s price has slipped below $8,000 to hit a 35-day low. Just an hour after the May 23 trading session began, data from CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index shows the price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency started to fall, dropping to its lowest point since April 18. After steadily climbing up to nearly $10,000 on May 6, bitcoin’s price has been on a gradual decline since then towards a current low at $7,876, reflecting a 20 percent drop over the past two weeks.  The price has bounced back slightly to $7,910 as of press time. That said, the current price still shows a 30 percent premium over bitcoin’s lowest point this year at $5,947 seen on Feb. 5. Meanwhile, bitcoin’s price drop also coincides with a wider market sell-off. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is also at its one-month low with $352 billion changing hands. In fact, nearly all of the top 100 assets by market cap are showing 10 to 20 percent declines at press time. According to CoinMarketCap, among the world’s largest five cryptocurrencies, both XRP and bitcoin cash are trading at a one-month low at $0.63 and $1,120 respectively.

" Eight years ago today, the first reported exchange of bitcoin for a consumer product – a pair of Papa John’s pizzas – took place. At a total cost of 10,000 bitcoins, it was a milestone for the adoption of cryptocurrency and one that has since been commemorated though the celebration of May 22 as “Bitcoin Pizza Day.” Yet even the most cursory observation of Bitcoin Pizza Day isn’t complete without a calculation of precisely how much, in dollar terms, those two pizzas cost. With that, CoinDesk is today releasing a new widget that provides a real-time calculation that you can add to any website.  As of press time, that’s about $83.7 million for the two pies, or just shy of $42 million apiece. But why does this matter? To understand, one needs to wind back the clock to 2010. In mid-May of that year, a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz sought to exchange some of his hard-earned bitcoins for pizza – several days later, he was able to do so with the aid of a fellow user of the Bitcoin Talk online forum, then a central hub for discussion around cryptocurrency. A deal was struck: 10,000 BTC for two Papa John’s pizzas. That eye-watering amount was worth a mere $25 at the time, or a fraction of a penny apiece. Yet at the time, it wasn’t so much the number of bitcoins spent or the product involved – the event was a milestone simply because the transaction had taken place. Though limited to 16 slices of pizza, the era of bitcoin-powered commerce had begun – not to mention the silent wincing over spending millions of dollars for two pizzas. “It wasn’t like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,” Hanyecz said in a 2013 interview with The New York Times, adding: “No one knew it was going to get so big.” Still, the tradition lives on, with the purchase being used to track other notable bitcoin milestones. Indeed, it was Hanyecz himself who would later participate in what might one day be known as “Lightning Pizza Day” after he used the next-generation technology, now in development, to purchase a pie in February.

" Bitcoin’s failed bull move on Sunday has left the doors open for the bears to make a comeback. The inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on May 20 signaled a short-term bullish reversal that could have seen bitcoin rise to $9,000 (target as per the measured height method). However, the bulls ran out of steam at a high of $8,644 yesterday and prices had fallen back to $8,240 at time of writing – a drop of 2.8 percent over the last 24 hours, according to Bitfinex. The decline did not come as a surprise, though, given the breakout lacked volume support, and a drop to $8,000 could now be on the cards.  As seen in the chart above, BTC fell back below the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline yesterday, weakening the bulls and has established a lower-high and lower-low pattern (bearish setup). While a failed breakout usually indicates a bigger-picture bearish reversal, in this case it means the corrective rally from the low of $7,925 has ended and the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990 has resumed. Thus, prices could drop below the immediate support of $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement) seen in the daily chart below.  A break below $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement) would bolster the bearish setup seen in the hourly chart and would allow a drop to $8,000. Note, though, that the 5-day and 10-day moving averages are beginning to curl upwards, so if the price moves above $8,408 (daily high), the bulls could make a comeback.

" Bitcoin (BTC) has bounced back above $8,500, but the rally is not backed by decent trading volumes, the technical charts indicate. The cryptocurrency closed below key technical levels on Thursday, signaling a bearish breakdown, but the sell-off unexpectedly ran out of steam at $7,925 a day later. Subsequently, bitcoin gained more than $500 over the weekend, rising back above resistance at the 50-day moving average. At time of writing, BTC is changing hands at around $8,530, having clocked a six-day high of $8,644 earlier today. While last week’s bearish trend seems to have run out of steam (as seen in the charts below), the weekend’s low-volume rally risks trapping the bulls on the wrong side of the market. The inverse head-and-shoulders breakout indicates short-term bullish trend reversal – i.e. the pullback from the high of $9,990 has ended and the breakout has opened the doors to $9,000 (target as per the measured height method.  The daily chart shows yesterday’s candle closed (as per UTC) above Saturday’s doji candle high of $8,468, signaling a bullish reversal. Further, the 5-day and 10-day moving averages have shed bearish bias (are no longer sloping downwards). As a result, the probability that bitcoin will rally to $9,000 this week is high. However, the bullish case significantly weakens if we take into account the figures for trading volume. Volume is an important indicator, as it shows the level of interest in bitcoin. A rally backed by high volumes means greater reliance can be placed on the bullish move. Conversely, a low volume rally trends to end up being a bull trap. In BTC’s case, currently, trading volume on Bitfinex continues to decline and more importantly remained low alongside positive price action, as seen in the chart above. Further, trading volume across all exchanges fell below $5 billion over the weekend – the lowest level since April 11, according to CoinMarketCap. Thus, the sustainability of the rally seen over the weekend is under question. Running up steps image via Shutterstock",2018-05-21
" Bitcoin’s (BTC) drop to one-month lows below $8,000 has strengthened the bear grip on the markets, the technical charts indicate. The cryptocurrency fell to $7,925 on Bitfinex earlier today – the lowest level since April 18 and has retraced 50 percent of the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 to May 5 high of $9,990. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,120, representing a 2 percent drop in the last 24 hours. The recovery from the low of $7,925 could be associated with the oversold conditions shown by the relative strength index (RSI) in the hourly chart. However, the gains will likely be short-lived as the odds are stacked against the bulls, according to technical charts.  BTC closed well below the 50-day moving average (MA) yesterday, signaling a continuation of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990. Further, BTC has also found acceptance below $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement), a level which acted as a strong support since May 12. The 5-day moving average (MA) and the 10-day MA continues to slope downwards in favor of the bears. The relative strength index (RSI) is also biased bearish (below 50.00 and falling). And last but not the least, BTC’s turn lower from $8,884 (May 14  high) and drop below $8,100 yesterday have established a lower highs and lows pattern (bearish setup). So, it is quite clear that the drop to one-month lows in the last 24 hours has the put bears in the driver’s seat. BTC looks set to test the immediate support lined up at $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement). A daily close (as per UTC) below that level would be the final confirmation of bearish trend reversal and will likely be followed by a sell-off $7,000. Only a daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA (currently seen at $8,555) would abort the bearish view and could yield sideways to positive action. Bitcoin image via Shutterstock",2018-05-18
" Bitcoin’s (BTC) bears have unraveled the minor rally in prices since Saturday and are now looking to pull the cryptocurrency below the $8,000 mark, the technical charts indicate. The bears’ comeback comes after bitcoin saw minor gains after the May 12 low of $8,204, but the bulls repeatedly failed to cut through the key falling trendline hurdle. As a result, bitcoin fell to a 3.5-week low of $8,100 on Bitfinex earlier today. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,366 – down 4.7 percent in 24 hours.  The above chart shows that bitcoin has dipped below the 50-day moving average (MA), currently located at $8,290. As discussed yesterday, a close (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA would signal resumption of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 and could yield deeper sell-off to $7,800. The rejection at the descending trendline hurdle and a drop to $8,100 has reinforced the bearish view put forward by the short-term moving averages (5-day and 10-day), which are sloping downwards in favor of the bears. The retreat from $8,884 to $8,100 has also established a falling top (lower highs pattern) – a (you guessed it) bearish setup. While the 10-day MA has crossed the 100-day MA from above (bearish crossover), and the relative strength index (RSI) is also biased bearish (below 50.00 and falling). As a result, there is a high probability that bitcoin will now go on to close today (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA and confirm a bear revival.  The bad news (for the bulls, at least) continues in the 4-hour chart. The downside break of the expanding channel (bearish breakdown) indicates the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990 has resumed and could yield a drop to $7,524 (target as per the measured height method). Note, the major moving averages (50, 100 and 200) are sloping downwards (bearish). Bear graffiti image via Shutterstock",2018-05-16
" Bitcoin (BTC) is stuck in a narrow $550 range between the key long-term moving averages today, but may be prepping for a breakout, the technical charts suggest. With the bull/bear bias now unclear, the big problem now is trying to work out in which direction the price will go. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,760 on Bitfinex, and is trading between the 50-day moving average (MA) at $8,287 and the 100-day moving average at $8,837. The sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990 came to halt around the 50-day MA on Saturday. Further, the 50-day MA also acted as strong support on Monday. Meanwhile, on both occasions, the rebound from the 50-day MA ran out of steam around the 100-day MA hurdle. The rangebound action seen in the last three days has established the 50-day MA as a major support and the 100-day MA as a formidable resistance and the breakout of this zone will likely set the tone for the next big move in BTC.  On Monday, BTC created a doji  – a candlestick pattern, which indicates indecision in the marketplace. However, when viewed against the backdrop of the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990, the doji signals indecision among the bears (or bearish exhaustion). So, the immediate bearish outlook has been neutralized. A close today (as per UTC) above the 100-day MA of $8,837 would signal bullish doji reversal and upside break of the trading range. Meanwhile, a close below the 50-day MA of $8,287 would confirm downside break of the trading range and bearish doji continuation pattern, i.e. sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 has resumed. That said, the odds of the bullish breakout (or bull doji reversal) still appear low, as the bulls face an uphill task as seen in the chart below.  On the above chart, the falling trendline resistance is seen around $8,810 and is immediately followed by hurdle at $8,910 (expanding channel resistance). With major moving averages (50, 100 and 200) trending south (bearish), BTC bulls will likely struggle to cut through resistance at $8,900 in a convincing manner. Note, the bears are about to score another brownie point by pushing the 50-candle MA below the 200-candle MA (bearish crossover). The 5-day MA and the 10-day MA (seen in the daily chart) are also biased bearish. Another rejection at the descending trendline seen in the 4-hour chart will likely yield a drop to 50-day MA located at $8,287. That said, only a daily close (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA would signal a revival of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 and would allow a deeper drop to $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to the May 5 high) or even as low as $7,698 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July 2015 low to the December 2017 high). On the other hand, a convincing move above $8,910 (expanding channel hurdle) would expose resistance lined up at $9,390. Chalk arrows image via Shutterstock",2018-05-15
" Bitcoin (BTC) is on the back foot having hit three-week lows over the weekend and now risks deeper losses below $8,200, the technical charts indicate. The cryptocurrency fell to $8,204 on Bitfinex on Saturday – the lowest level since April 19 – and was last seen changing hands at $8,365, down around 16 percent from the recent high of $9,990. Note, the bears failed to cut through the support at $8,207 (the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to the May 5 high) in a convincing manner on Saturday. However, the ensuing corrective rally was also short-lived: BTC failed to beat the descending 5-day moving average (MA) hurdle, seen yesterday at $8,760 and fell to a low of $8,271 today. The price action indicates BTC is clearly not out of the woods yet and, if anything, the bear grip seems to have strengthened over the last few days.  The bear flag breakdown indicated on the chart signals a continuation of the sell-off and has opened the doors to $7,300 (target as per the measured height method), although the target looks far fetched as of now. Nevertheless, the pattern does indicate scope for a drop below $8,000. The relative strength index (RSI) is biased to the bears (below 50.00) and the 100-candle moving average (MA) and the 200-candle MA continue to slope downwards, also in favor of the bears.  The chart shows the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 ran out of steam near $10,026 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July 2015 low to the December 2017 high) and the 5-month and 10-month MAs are beginning to slope downwards in favor of the bears for the first time since September 2014. So, the BTC bulls need progress soon, else the 5-month MA will cut the 10-month MA from above (bearish crossover), confirming a long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.  The short-term trend remains bearish as indicated by the downward sloping 5-day and 10-day MAs. This, coupled with the bearish development on the hourly and monthly charts, indicates that bitcoin will likely find acceptance below key support at $8,270 (50-day moving average) and $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to May 5 high). In such a case, bitcoin risks falling below $8,000. BTC looks set to take out support at $8,207 and could then drop to $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to the May 5 high) or even as low as $7,698 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July 2015 low to the December 2017 high). Bullish scenario: Another rebound from $8,207 and a break above $8,760 would open doors for a move back above $9,000. A daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA, currently seen at $9,038 would confirm the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 has ended.

" Bitcoin (BTC) hit a three-week low of $8,713 on Bitfinex earlier today and looks set to extend losses further, price chart analysis indicates. The cryptocurrency failed to cut through the descending (bearish) 5-day moving average (MA) located at $9,382 yesterday, despite the bullish falling channel breakout on May 9, and fell below the $9,000 mark as anticipated. As of writing, BTC is changing hands around $8,800 – below the 100-day moving average (MA) of $8,849 and down 2.42 percent from the previous day’s close (as per UTC) of $9,018. The 10 percent decline from the recent high of $9,990 has weakened the bulls and has boosted the odds of a deeper drop to the 50-day moving average lined up at $8,282.  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows BTC closed (as per UTC) yesterday below $9,149 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement), pushing indicators into bearish territory. For instance, the relative strength index (RSI) has dipped below 50.00, confirming a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change and opening the doors for a further drop in prices. The 5-day MA and the 10-day MA are both trending south, having witnessed a bearish crossover earlier this week. On the 4-hour chart, BTC has breached the trendline support in a convincing manner, and the 50-candle and 100-candle MAs have topped out (shed bullish bias). The cryptocurrency looks set to test the gradually ascending (mildly bullish) 200-candle MA located just above the $8,628 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement, seen in the daily chart). However, the moving average support may hold ground for a few hours as the relative strength index (RSI) shows oversold conditions.  The 50-hour MA, 100-hour MA, and 200-hour MA are trending south and positioned one below the other in favor of the bears. Yet, the RSI on the 60-minute chart also shows oversold conditions. So, a minor corrective rally cannot be ruled out. Bitcoin and chart image via Shutterstock",2018-05-11
" Despite a brief rally yesterday, bitcoin (BTC) is still in corrective mode and risks falling back below $9,000, chart analysis suggests. The cryptocurrency broke out of the bearish falling channel setup Wednesday, courtesy of a bullish relative strength index (RSI) divergence – indicating the pullback from the recent high of $9,990 had ended at a low of $8,980. The breakout also raised the prospects of a stronger move towards $9,767 (April 25 high) and possibly even the $10,000 mark. However, the ascent has been cut short around $9,380 in the last 15 hours, as seen in the hourly chart below.  As of writing, bitcoin is attempting a break above $9,380 on Bitfinex, above which a major resistance is seen at $9,442 – the 200-hour moving average (MA). Meanwhile, a strong support is seen at $9,228 (marked by a circle). The momentum studies are biased bearish. For instance, the 100-hour MA is trending south in favor of the bears and the 50-hour MA is still gradually descending (yet to bottom out or shed bearish bias). As a result, a convincing move above $9,442 could be a tough task. Further, the short-term moving averages in the daily chart have rolled over in favor of the bears.  The bearish crossover between the 5-day MA and the 10-day MA indicates a short-term (5 days) bullish-to-bearish trend change. It also indicates the pullback from the recent high of $9,990 has not run its course. Arrows image via Shutterstock",2018-05-10
" Venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya has countered billionaire Warren Buffett’s recent derogatory statements on bitcoin, stating that the cryptocurrency is “important.” His comments come after Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, argued that bitcoin is more of a gamble than an investment at the end of April, and then, last weekend at a shareholders’ meeting, he said bitcoin is “probably rat poison squared.” While calling himself a Buffett “disciple,” Palihapitiya told CNBC that Buffett is wrong about bitcoin. “Not everybody is right all the time,” he told the news source, further suggesting that that knowledge about technology is not in Buffett’s “circle of competence.” Palihapitiya, a former Facebook and AOL executive, went on to push for the cryptocurrency’s benefits, saying it is a replacement to gold and: “Something like bitcoin is really important, because it is not correlated to the rest of the market.” Speaking about the financial crisis, he said that “things that we thought were hedges went away” and “broke down.” Bitcoin is viewed as providing a hedge to traditional finance by those who have owned the digital currency, he said.

" Having hit seven-day lows below $9,000 this morning, bitcoin (BTC) is looking decidedly weak. The cryptocurrency fell to $8,980 on Bitfinex a few hours ago and was last seen changing hands at $9,080 – down 1.13 percent from the previous day’s close (as per UTC) of $9,184. The downwards move does not come as a surprise, however, with the bear flag breakdown witnessed yesterday opening the doors for a fall to $8,865. Now, unless the bulls can make a defense of support at $9,055 (seen in chart below), the cryptocurrency risks once more falling below $8,000.  Bitcoin risks a deeper sell-off to $8,652 (April 26 low) if the failure to beat inverse head-and-shoulders neckline hurdle (as seen over the weekend) is followed by a 4-hour close below the trendline support, currently seen at $9,055. The 50-candle and 100-candle moving averages (MAs) have shed bullish bias (topped out) and BTC is trading well below other key moving averages. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) is holding well below 50.00 (in the bearish territory), also signaling scope for further losses. Additionally, the action in the hourly chart below also suggests that BTC is risking a move downwards. As of writing, BTC is trading on a weaker footing as indicated by the series of lower highs and lower lows, represented by the falling channel (bearish pattern). The 50-hour, 100-hour and 200-hour MAs are all biased to the bears (trending south). The bear flag breakdown, seen yesterday, also favors a drop below $9,055. The only factor that might stall the decline is the bullish relative strength index (RSI) divergence. Note that the RSI has not formed lower lows in response to lower lows in prices.

" Bitcoin dropped to four-day lows below $9,200 on Monday and now looks set to explore levels below the $9,000 mark, the technical charts indicate. Yesterday’s downwards move meant the cryptocurrency closed below the 10-day moving average (MA) – signaling short-term bullish invalidation – having failed to beat the key inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance over the weekend. As of writing, BTC is trading at $9,357 on Bitfinex – largely unchanged on the day, but down 6.3 percent from the recent high of $9,990. Worryingly for the bulls, the price chart analysis indicates the losses could be extended further over the next 24 hours.  The inverted flag (also known as a bear flag) breakdown suggests the sell-off from the high of $9,990 has resumed and BTC could drop to $8,865 (target as per the measured height method – pole height subtracted from breakdown price). The momentum studies also favor the bears, with both the 50-hour moving average (MA) and 100-hour MA showing a bearish bias (sloping downwards). Further, the 50-hour MA looks set to cut the 200-hour MA from above (bearish crossover).  As noted earlier, BTC closed below the 10-day MA yesterday, signaling that the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 has made a temporary top at $9,990. Further, BTC’s attempt to retake the 10-day MA failed earlier today and the 5-day MA has adopted a bearish bias. As a result, the cryptocurrency looks likely to find acceptance below the ascending trendline (drawn from the April 18 low and May 1 low) and possibly drop below the $9,000 mark in the next 24 hours or so.

" Researchers from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank’s San Francisco division believe that the launch of bitcoin futures on several marketplaces in the U.S. last December played a role in a subsequent slump in the cryptocurrency’s price. According to a research paper published on Monday, the authors  – including three researchers from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco as well as a finance professor from Stanford University – believe bitcoin’s recent price trend is somewhat similar to how the housing bubble developed in the U.S. during the 2000s. And the introduction of bitcoin-related derivatives played a part in that trend, the authors wrote. As previously reported by CoinDesk, the Cboe and CME Group moved their bitcoin futures products to the market near the end of the year after obtaining approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). It was around this time that the price of bitcoin nearly hit $20,000 after surging throughout that year, only to fall close to $6,000 by the end of the first week of February. Citing data and calculations conducted through their research, the Fed paper’s authors argue that the “rapid rise of the price of bitcoin and its decline following [the] issuance of futures on the CME is consistent with pricing dynamics suggested elsewhere in financial theory.” Such pricing dynamics, as the researchers explained, refer to a trend where demand for a financial instrument is initially driven by optimists who push up the price until the point where the market introduces a mechanism that allows pessimists to invest reversely. The researchers argued: “And until December 17, those investors [optimists] were right: As with a self-fulfilling prophecy, optimists’ demand pushed the price of bitcoin up, energizing more people to join in and keep pushing up the price. The pessimists, however, had no mechanism available to put money behind their belief that the bitcoin price would collapse. So they were left to wait for their ‘I told you so’ moment.” That said, such trends may not continue indefinitely, as the authors further suggested. As the bitcoin mining process goes on and fewer coins become available (as a result of the scheduled halving of the network subsidy, now pegged at 12.5 BTC per block), the authors argue that the transactional function of bitcoin as a payment method could play a leading role in driving its value as “speculative dynamics disappear.” Read the full Fed paper below: FedBTCPaper by CoinDesk on Scribd  U.S. dollar image via CoinDesk",2018-05-07
" Bitcoin’s (BTC) pullback in prices over the weekend has dampened the immediate prospects for the bulls, the technical studies indicate. Having witnessed a bullish pennant breakout last Friday, the cryptocurrency looked set to scale the $10,000 mark in a convincing manner over the weekend. However, the bullish move unexpectedly ran out of steam at $9,990 at 13:00 UTC on Saturday, according to Bitfinex, and had retreated to $9,258 earlier today. As of writing, bitcoin is changing hands at $9,400, representing a 2.67 percent drop from the previous day’s close of $9,658. While the pullback is not good for the bulls, only a drop below $8,650 would give the bears the upper hand.  The above chart shows the pullback occurred after BTC was rejected (marked by a circle) at the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance of $9,950. As noted above, BTC had looked on a solid ground following the bull pennant breakout, so the drop to $9,300 came as something of a surprise and has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook. That said, a rebound from the ascending (bullish) 100-candle moving average (MA) in the 4-hour chart could put $10,000 back on the map.  The daily chart shows that the 10-day MA is sloping upwards (bullish), providing more cause for bull optimism, especially if today’s candle closes (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA (located at $9,468). On the other hand, if BTC closes below the 10-day MA, then the case for a further drop towards $8,652 (April 26 low and pennant low as seen in 4-hour chart) would strengthen. The pullback from $9,990 to $9,258 has dampened the immediate bullish outlook. Repeated failure on the part of the bears to keep prices below the ascending 100-candle MA on 4-hour chart, and a close today above the 10-day MA of $9,468, could yield re-test of $10,000. A close above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance seen today at $9,980, would open the doors to $13,475 (target as per the measured height method), although the target looks far-fetched for now. In the short-run though, BTC could rise to $11,700 on the back of an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout. Bearish scenario: A break below $8,652 (pennant low) would add credence to rejection at inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance and signal a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change. In such a case, BTC will likely drop to levels below $8,000. Bitcoin chart image via Shutterstock",2018-05-07
" Following a bull breakout last night, bitcoin (BTC) looks set to test $10,000 and could possibly move higher over the weekend. Bitcoin closed yesterday (as per UTC) at $9,759 on Bitfinex – the highest daily close since March 7 – signaling the upside break of the week-long narrowing price range we’ve been anticipating. The cryptocurrency also clocked a two-month high of $9,875 yesterday. At time of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,776 and remains on the hunt for a big break above the $10,000 mark, as indicated by the bullish setup in the technical charts below.  The chart above shows a pennant breakout (bullish continuation pattern), indicating that the rally from April lows below $6,500 has resumed. The move has opened the doors for a rise to $10,455–$11,950 (target calculated using two variations of the measured height method). However, the 4-hour relative strength index (RSI) is close to moving above 70.00, signaling overbought conditions. As a result, a rally to $11,950 looks to be a tough task to achieve and $10,455 may be more realistic.  The ascending, bullish 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA also favor further upside in prices. Meanwhile, the RSI is stationed at 62 – well below 70 (overbought territory), leaving enough room for a rally to $10,400–$10,500. And, last but not the least, BTC’s bullish breakout yesterday was backed by a 35 percent rise in trading volumes, according to CoinMarketCap. A high volume breakout only validates the argument that the rally has legs. Darts board image via Shutterstock",2018-05-04
" Cai Wensheng, an angel investor from China and chairman of photo retouching app provider Meitu, says he has achieved his goal of accruing 10,000 bitcoins. In an open group Q&A session with tech entrepreneur Wang Feng on WeChat on Thursday, Cai disclosed that although he was holding a single bitcoin in January of this year, he moved to increase his portfolio over the first quarter of 2018 amid the bearish market’s lower prices. Soon after December’s record high round $20,000, the price of bitcoin started dropping in January. It reached a low for the year so far below $6,000 in February, before climbing again to over $9,700 at press time. According to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, Cai’s holdings are now worth around $96 million. Cai explained his reasoning for the investment during the Q&A, saying: “I only had single digit unit of bitcoin, just for fun in January. But when I got certain that bitcoin and blockchain is the future, I set the goal of holding 10,000 bitcoin. So I started around end of January to build my [holdings] following the price decline. The more it dropped, the more I bought in and now the mission is basically complete.” Born in the 1970s, Cai made his name and first fortune by investing in domain names during the internet bubble and expanded his investment portfolio over the next decade as an angel investor. His current venture, Meitu, a popular photo retouching tool in China that claims to have over 90 million monthly active users, went public in Hong Kong in December 2016 with a valuation of $5 billion at the time. Cai’s disclosure makes him one of the few big-name investors in China to have openly disclosed their bitcoin holdings. It also comes at a time when Meitu is aiming to utilize blockchain technology to decentralize storage of users’ data, according to a white paper published in January.

" Bitcoin is famous (or infamous) for its daily price jumps and falls, but lately the charts seem to be bordering on the comatose. So, has the cryptocurrency’s volatility really dropped or are we in business as usual? We crunched the numbers to find out, and while things have been calm of late, it certainly hasn’t been a quiet 2018 for the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency. In fact, bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed daily volatility (or an inter-day trading range) above $1,000 as many as 43 times so far this year (using price data from CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index). That would seem a lot perhaps, but it’s not so simple. When we break down the data over time another pattern reveals itself. if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""t9zpR""]={},window.datawrapper[""t9zpR""].embedDeltas={""100"":581.0208339999999,""200"":527.0208339999999,""300"":527.0208339999999,""400"":501.020834,""500"":501.020834,""700"":501.020834,""800"":501.020834,""900"":501.020834,""1000"":501.020834},window.datawrapper[""t9zpR""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-t9zpR""),window.datawrapper[""t9zpR""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""t9zpR""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""t9zpR""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""t9zpR""==b)window.datawrapper[""t9zpR""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""}); The number of days in 2018 when the trading range was above $1,000 was highest in January, passing that level 21 times. Notably, that month saw the crypto markets rocked by regulatory talk in South Korea and China that caused jitters among traders and investors. Moving on, the number of days the trading range was above $1,000 in February dropped by nearly half to 13. Since then volatility has indeed plummeted, dropping to seven days in March and just two days in April. It’s worth noting that bitcoin’s price starting falling sharply from near record highs at the start of January amid the market angst over the Asian news. Since volatility tends to spike during bear markets and drop during bullish price action, this pattern is something that could have been expected. So, as the bearish atmosphere prevailed early in the year, the frequency of trading ranges above $1,000 was at its highest, while the subsequent bullish shift in the market has had the opposite effect. For example, BTC rallied from $6,443 to $9,536 over the last 32 days. Meanwhile, during the same time period, the average daily volatility dropped to $454. Further, the daily volatility stood at $278 yesterday – down almost 70 percent from the average daily volatility of $922 seen this year and below the 2017 average of $348 (predominantly a bull market). An extended period of low volatility is often followed by a sharp rise in volatility (big move). The mean reversion theory also states that readings (volumes, price, returns) eventually move back toward the means (averages). So, it looks safe to say the business is about to pick up. Right now, the technical set up on the charts is bullish, so the big move, when it happens, will likely happen on the higher side. But, as always, there are no guarantees… Yo-yo image via Shutterstock",2018-05-03
" Sell in May and go away? While the month may traditionally give equity bulls cold feet, it should probably not be a cause of worry for the bitcoin market. Indeed, it’s true the month of May is often a weak period for equities, and that bitcoin has acted as a risk asset (moving in tandem with equities) since February. As such, cryptocurrency investors may fear that a potential drop in equities could end up dragging bitcoin prices lower. However, historical data suggests that bitcoin is more likely to build upon its April rally this month. Notably, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has scored gains in the month of May in five out of the last seven years, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""XLfQQ""]={},window.datawrapper[""XLfQQ""].embedDeltas={""100"":453.020834,""200"":426.020834,""300"":400.020834,""400"":400.020834,""500"":400.020834,""700"":400.020834,""800"":400.020834,""900"":400.020834,""1000"":400.020834},window.datawrapper[""XLfQQ""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-XLfQQ""),window.datawrapper[""XLfQQ""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""XLfQQ""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""XLfQQ""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""XLfQQ""==b)window.datawrapper[""XLfQQ""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""}); According to the data: Furthermore, BTC has fared well in every second quarter since its creation – the highest being 1,964 percent in Q2 2011, when bitcoin jumped from $0.78 to $16.10. Clearly, history is on the bulls’ side. Further, the seasonality analysis only adds credence to the bullish set up as seen in the bitcoin chart below.  As discussed yesterday, the observed bull pennant breakout could see the recent rally from the April low of $6,425 (Bitfinex price) extend to $10,000 or even higher. The cryptocurrency has been restricted to a narrowing price range for more than a week and has spent a better part of the last 12 hours trading between $9,150 and $9,300. As the technical theory has it, the longer the duration of the consolidation zone, the more violent the breakout tends to be. So, BTC could move well above the $10,000 mark in an hour or two post-breakout, if the bulls gain the upper hand. BTC tends to perform well in May, thus an upside breakout of the narrowing price range is more likely and could yield a quick move higher to $10,000. On the other hand, a downside break would open the doors to $8,490 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $6,425 to $9,767.4). Only a daily close (as per UTC) below $7,823 (April 17 low) would signal a bear revival. Chalk arrow image via Shutterstock",2018-05-03
" A straightforward data point – the total supply of bitcoin hit 17 million. But as with most things in crypto, it wasn’t so simple. Every 10 minutes or so, miners find a block of transactions and the network adds 12.5 new bitcoin to the total supply as a reward for the finders. And each reward has been logged on the blockchain since bitcoin launched in early 2009. As such, it seemed like a number – a milestone – the industry could trust. But as some celebrated once the mark was hit on bitcoin data provider Blockchain’s website, others took to Twitter to rain on their parade. Jameson Lopp, Casa engineer and the creator of Statoshi.info, another public-facing bitcoin data site, tweeted: “Today I’ve learned that a lot of data sources are incorrectly reporting the total bitcoin supply. We haven’t actually hit 17 million BTC yet.” Lopp’s contention was that Blockchain.info, one of the most popular and highly-regarded sources for blockchain network data, among others, had not accounted for instances in which bitcoin miners, due to bugs and other causes, did not claim their full block reward. Unfortunately, these discrepancies in the total bitcoin supply metric are not the exception, but part of a larger problem that stems from the “opaque” methodologies these blockchain data analysis providers use, according to Greg Cipolaro, the CEO of Digital Asset Research (DAR), a firm that provides blockchain analysis to clients. As such, DAR went on a mission to figure out Blockchain’s methods for what it calls “one of the longest standing mysteries in the cryptocurrency community” – bitcoin’s estimated transaction value. In the company’s report on the subject, published recently, DAR said Blockchain over-estimated transaction values from October to February 2017 and has mostly underestimated them since then. Executives from Blockchain were not available for interview before press time. But it’s not only Blockchain. Cipolaro cited CoinMarketCap’s January removal (without warning) of South Korean exchange data from its price index. Since cryptocurrency prices on South Korean exchanges have tended to be higher, the eviction made it appear that the crypto markets were crashing. Panic selling ensued, setting off what Cipolaro called “a mini-flash crash.” In fairness, though, price indices always involve subjective decisions. That is true not only of cryptocurrencies but also the stock market. Yet without insight into how price and other metrics are arrived at, the cryptocurrency community could suffer. Accurate data is extremely important for investors, traders, users, developers, academics, journalists – basically everyone. Still, many people who depend on public blockchain data don’t realize how flawed some of this data is. Offering a grim outlook on the broad state of blockchain analysis today, Stefan Richter, a computer scientist who co-founded data provider BitcoinPrivacy, told CoinDesk: “There are, of course, software bugs in probably every explorer around.” And Cipolaro echoed that, saying, “This is not something you would notice unless you spent your days looking at it.” Luckily, some industry enthusiasts have noticed. Lopp, for one, is a cryptocurrency data hound. He pointed to bitcoin node count, a figure often cited as a measure of the network’s decentralization and health, as a particularly finicky metric. “I often hear folks say that there are only 10,000 bitcoin nodes,” Lopp said. But the source of that figure, Bitnodes, “only counts reachable nodes that accept incoming connections.” Addy Yeow, the creator of Bitnodes, confirmed that the site only counts “listening” nodes. As such, the total number of nodes could be far higher, according to both Lopp. Indeed, one estimate puts listening and non-listening nodes at nearly 140,000. And while Yeow agrees, he cautions that adding non-listening nodes to the metric would require making major assumptions. He explained that data sources that count non-listening nodes are actually taking part in a guessing game. Nodes that aren’t listening could still be connected, but behind a firewall, for example. Alternatively, they could have changed IP addresses, or the could have disconnected entirely. The analysis providers that take into account non-listening nodes use a formula which takes into account the number of days nodes have been non-listening in an effort to count them, but the more unseen-but-connected nodes they capture, the more disconnected nodes they erroneously include. Due to the issues with public data sets, many blockchain data professionals avoid using them and instead use data they calculate internally whenever possible. Chainalysis, a firm that analyzes blockchain data for clients including the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), is certainly skeptical. Kimberley Grauer, Chainalysis’ chief economist, said she prefers to use internal data because, “I know where the errors are; I know where the vulnerabilities are.” DAR’s Cipolaro echoed that, telling CoinDesk the company runs its own code, gleaning data from its own bitcoin node. Still, despite their shortcomings, Cipolaro has high praise for the free sites that make bitcoin data available to the public. “They provide a good source of high-quality information,” he said. And it’s obvious these companies are trying. When a bug in Blockchain’s web service made it appear (incorrectly) that bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto had moved some coins, the company fixed the problem. Certain issues should be easy to fix. Grauer pointed out that block explorers often neglect to note time zones, and they don’t all use the same one. While that’s not strictly wrong, it causes confusion. “Just compare blockchain.info to btc.com!” Grauer said. (We did: block 520672 was either mined at 23:18 on April 30 or 03:18 on May 1. There’s no hint of what time zone either site is using.) Other data sets won’t be as easy to clean up. While the bitcoin blockchain may be fully public for all to see, the complicated way in which transactions are performed means measuring their value can be quite the challenge. Even DAR does not claim its new method is perfectly accurate. “This will not likely be the last improvement we make,” the company said in its report. For the time being, the community will need to remember the old Russian proverb, repurposed by cypherpunks: “Don’t trust, verify.” Bingo image via Shutterstock",2018-05-03
" Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs will use its own money to trade bitcoin futures on behalf of its clients, according to the New York Times. The Times  reported Wednesday that while the exact launch date of the new trading operation is not yet set, the move came after the bank’s board of directors signed off on the initiative. Goldman is also set to “create its own, more flexible version of a future, known as a non-deliverable forward, which it will offer to clients,” according to the report. Goldman executive Rana Yared said the decision resulted from a growing number of inquiries from clients that indicated interest in holding bitcoin as an alternative asset. “It resonates with us when a client says, ‘I want to hold bitcoin or bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate store of value,’” she told the Times. The investment bank has hired its first “digital asset” trader, Justin Schmidt, to handle the daily operation. Schmidt previously worked as a trader at hedge fund Seven Eight Capital before leaving last year to trade cryptocurrencies. The news reflects the growing involvement of Goldman in the crypto-market, as CEO Lloyd Blankfein has previously said that the investment bank was clearing bitcoin futures for its clients. Per the Times, any deeper action – including the direct handling of bitcoin – will only come following approval from U.S. regulators. And according to Yared, Goldman officials have taken a cautious approach throughout the process. “For almost every person involved, there has been personal skepticism brought to the table,” Yared was quoted as saying, adding: “It is not a new risk that we don’t understand. It is just a heightened risk that we need to be extra aware of here.” Goldman Sachs logo image via Shutterstock",2018-05-03
" Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a narrowing price range over the past week, but a bullish breakout is looking likely, the technical charts suggest. The cryptocurrency created a bearish outside-day candle last Wednesday, signaling the rally from the low of $6,425 had run out of steam. However, the bitcoin bulls ensured there was no negative follow-through on Thursday and defended $8,800 over the weekend. While a convincing break above $9,500 has remained elusive so far, the charts suggest the bulls have the stronger hand going forward.  The chart above shows that bitcoin is trading in a narrowing price range with higher lows and lower highs, forming a bull pennant pattern. A bullish breakout would mean the rally from the low of $6,425 has resumed and could open the doors to $12,000 (target as per the measured height method – i.e. length of the flagpole added to breakout price). While that target looks a little far-fetched, BTC could rally to $10,000 on confirmation of a bull-pennant breakout (4-hour close above pennant resistance of $9,400). On the other hand,  a downside break would add credence to last Wednesday’s bearish outside-day candle and could yield a pullback to $8,490 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $6,425 to $9,767.4). That said, the odds of a bull-pennant breakout are high as indicated by the price action in the daily chart below.  The bears failed to capitalize on bullish exhaustion last week, as indicated by the bearish outside-day candle. This is evident from the lack of bearish follow-through on Thursday and higher lows pattern – $8,652 (April 26 low), $8,750 (April 28 low) and $8,818 (May 1 low). Further, the gradually ascending 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA continue to favor the bulls. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,120 on Bitfinex, representing marginal gains compared to the previous day’s close (as per UTC) of $9,066. Bitcoin image via Shutterstock",2018-05-02
" “I’d rather short ether.” Andrew Left, the activist short-seller behind Citron Research, told CoinDesk on Tuesday that he thinks both bitcoin and ether, the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network, are “bubbles.” If he had to choose one, though, he’d bet on ether’s price to fall. Left is known for writing explosive reports into companies like the Canadian pharmaceutical firm Valeant, arguing that investors should short them. His comments came a day after he fired a Twitter broadside at Square, a payments company that has been adding support for bitcoin buying and selling. He declared that the company’s share price is likely to drop to $30, from just under $49 prior to the tweet. “WallSt drunk on Bitcoin nonsense, SQ-Cash to BTC trading has been insignificant,” Left wrote. Square is scheduled to report its latest earnings data on Wednesday, and if “they’ve earned nothing from crypto, don’t be surprised,” Left told CoinDesk. Left has taken aim at other investments related to cryptocurrency in the past, but he told CoinDesk that each had an “individual reason.” Addressing bitcoin’s merits in and of itself, he acknowledged the appeal of a decentralized asset or a kind of digital gold, commenting: “I dig it.” He’s not so sure that bitcoin will win out, he said, but as mentioned before, he would gladly short the second-largest cryptocurrency by value. Left dismissed a bullish argument for ether – that its price will grow because entrepreneurs can issue tokens and build decentralized applications on top of the ethereum blockchain – using the analogy that Oracle doesn’t own part of the businesses that run on its own servers. In his view, ether bulls use a “circular argument” – that is, “it’ll go up because it’ll go up.” “I think both are bubbles,” he said of bitcoin and ether, but “if I were going to be wrong about one of these, it would be bitcoin.” Left has been shorting stocks full-time since 2001, and has said he’s made money every year. Short sellers profit when the price of a stock (or another asset) falls; they accomplish this by borrowing shares, selling them, and buying them back later to return to the original owner. The Citron founder is most famous for correctly predicting the fall in shares of Valeant, a Canadian pharmaceutical company that has been at the center of an accounting scandal.
