1," The past two sessions saw a lot of volatility and swing moves in bitcoin and altcoins. Tether drama sparked bearish moves in BTC and the price tumbled below the main USD 5,350 and USD 5,220 support levels. The price even declined below USD 5,000 and recently recovered above USD 5,200. Similarly, there were sharp declines in altcoins such as ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, EOS, litecoin, NEO, ADA and TRX. The market turned red and it may struggle in the near term. Total market capitalization  During the recent decline, bitcoin price  settled below the key uptrend support at USD 5,350. It opened the doors for more losses and the price declined below the USD 5,220 and USD 5,150 support levels. The price even dropped below USD 5,000 before staging a decent rebound above USD 5,150 and USD 5,200.
However, the price is likely to face a strong resistance near the USD 5,300 and USD 5,350 resistance levels in the near term. On the downside, the main supports are USD 5,150, USD 5,120 and USD 5,000. Ethereum price  extended losses and even broke the key USD 160 support level. ETH declined more than 5% and broke the USD 155 support as well. 
It traded close to the USD 150 support and recently recovered above USD 154. On the upside, there are many hurdles near the USD 158, USD 160 and USD 162 levels. If there is a fresh decline, the price could clear the USD 150 support level. Bitcoin cash price  extended losses below the USD 270 support and tested the USD 265 level. BCH/USD is currently down around 3% and it is testing the previous support (now resistance) at USD 270. The next key resistances are near the USD 275 and USD 278 levels. On the downside, a break below USD 265 might push the price towards USD 260.
EOS  declined and tested the USD 4.50 support level. It is currently recovering above USD 4.65, but it is likely to face a lot of offers near the USD 4.75 and USD 4.80 resistance levels.
Ripple price  declined heavily below the USD 0.300 and USD 0.292 support levels. XRP/USD even broke the USD 0.288 support and tested USD 0.285. It corrected higher recently, but facing resistance near USD 0.295 and USD 0.298. There was a sharp decline in the past two sessions and many small cap altcoins weakened by more than 8%, including NULS, BAT, MKR, R, WTC, ENJ, OMG, NANO, GNT, ORBS, ARK, WAVES and XTZ. Out of these, NULS is down around 12% and BAT declined nearly 11%. To sum up, bitcoin moved down sharply into a bearish zone. If BTC/USD struggles to move back above USD 5,350, there is a risk of a fresh decline below USD 5,150 in the coming sessions, and altcoins are likely to follow the same path.

0," Recently, bitcoin price started a downside correction and traded below the USD 5,500 and USD 5,460 support levels. BTC/USD even broke the USD 5,400 level and traded close to USD 5,350. The price is currently (08:10 UTC) consolidating and seems to be struggling near the USD 5,400 level. Ethereum price too faced an increase in selling pressure and it recently tested the USD 160 support. Ripple was sold aggressively, resulting in a drop towards the USD 0.290 support area. Overall, the market is currently red and it could extend losses before it starts a decent rebound. Total market capitalization  There was an extended decline in bitcoin price  below the USD 5,400 support level. BTC/USD tested the USD 5,350 support and recently rebounded higher. However, the price seems to be facing a strong resistance near the USD 5,400 - USD 5,420 zone. The next key resistance is at USD 5,440, above which the price may revisit.
On the downside, the main support is at USD 5,350. If there are more losses, there is a risk of a drop towards the USD 5,260 support area in the near term. Ethereum price  managed to stay above the USD 160 support after yesterday’s decline. ETH/USD is currently consolidating and it seems like the price may test the USD 165 resistance in the near term.
However, if there is no break above the USD 165 resistance, the price may revisit the USD 160 support. Any further losses is likely to open the doors for more downsides towards the USD 150 support. Bitcoin cash price  found support near the USD 170 level and it is currently consolidating losses. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 280, above which the price is likely to recover towards the USD 292 or USD 295 resistance level. On the downside, the main supports are USD 272 and USD 270.
EOS  seems to be following a bearish path and it recently broke the USD 4.70 support level. The price tested the USD 4.55 level and it is currently down around 3%. If there are additional losses, the next stop for sellers could be USD 4.40.
Ripple price  extended decline and broke the USD 0.290 support level. XRP/USD even spiked below the USD 0.290 support and later rebounded above USD 0.292 and USD 0.294. On the upside, the main resistances are at USD 0.298 and USD 0.300. The past few hours saw additional weakness and many small cap altcoins dropped between 6% - 12%, including MXM, XTZ, DGD, BTS, PAI, INB, WAVES, DGTX, AE and GXC. Out of these, MXM is down around 11% and XTZ declined nearly 10%. To sum up, bitcoin is slightly under pressure near USD 5,400 and it could dip once again. However, there are many supports on the downside for BTC and it is likely to bounce back above USD 5,450 and USD 5,480 in the near term.

0," Bitcoin (BTC) may revisit sub-$5,000 levels in the short-term, as a widely followed technical indicator is flashing a historically bearish pattern. With the recent rally to five-month highs above $5,600, the 50-day moving average (MA) crossed the 200-day MA from below in what’s termed a “golden crossover” – a confirmation of long-term bull market. However, short-term technical indicators, especially a bearish divergence on the relative strength index (RSI), are suggesting a drop in prices before the rally picks up pace again. The bearish RSI pattern is widely considered an early sign of trend change and has yielded notable price pullbacks in the past. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $5,430 on Bitstamp – down 3.5 percent from the high of $5,627 hit earlier this week. Bitcoin first jumped above $5,000 on April 1 and further climbed to highs above $5,400, lifting the 14-day RSI to 88.00 – the highest level since December 2017. With the indicator signaling extreme overbought conditions, bitcoin’s price retreated to $4,912 on April 12 before jumping to a five-month high of $5,627 earlier this week. Essentially, BTC created a bullish higher low at $4,912 and a higher high of $5,627. However, as bitcoin set the new higher high, the RSI instead formed a bearish divergence – a pattern confirmed with the near 2 percent price drop seen in the last 24 hours.  As can be seen above, BTC confirmed a bearish divergence of the RSI with a 2 percent drop to $9,623 on May 6, 2018, and fell 38 percent to lows below $5,800 by the end of June. Before that, the 14-day RSI diverged in favor of the bears with bitcoin’s 6.5 percent price drop to $17,700 on Dec. 19, 2017. That was followed by a quick 36 percent sell-off to $11,200 by Dec. 22. There are earlier notable examples, too (not shown). BTC fell 6.5 percent to $4,600 on Sept. 2, 2017. With the sharp slide, the RSI diverged in favor of the bears and prices tumbled to $2,972 on Sept. 15. Again that was a 36 percent price drop. Another bearish divergence of the RSI on June 12, 2017, was also followed by a quick 20 percent price slide that ended at lows near $2,120 a few days later. If history is any guide, the latest bearish divergence of the RSI could send prices down to $4,912 (April 12 low).  The 30-day moving average (MA), which served as strong support in March, is currently located at $4,969. Importantly, the average is still trending north, indicating a bullish setup. A strong defense of that average would revive the short-term bullish outlook and could yield a rally to fresh multi-month high above the recent high of $5,627. A violation there, however, could invite stronger selling pressure, leading to a drop to the 200-day MA at $4,466. The longer-term outlook will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above $4,236 – the bearish lower high created on Dec. 24 and violated on April 2.

0," Entrepreneur and Bitcoin bull John McAfee says he knows who the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, is and promises to tell - just not right now, the moment is not exactly right. Apparently, his “imminent” extradition request to the United States means his attorney believes revealing Nakamoto’s identity would currently be too dangerous for McAfee himself. “The US extradition request to the Bahamas is imminent. I met with Mario Gray, my extradition lawyer, and it is now clear <...> that releasing the identity of Satoshi at this time could influence the trial and risk my extradition. I cannot risk that. I'll wait,” McAfee wrote on Twitter. Additionally, he told Bloomberg that Satoshi is not thrilled about the outing: “I’ve spoken with him, and he is not a happy camper about my attempt to out him.”  Although very few in the community seem to believe him, they are still humoring him in order to debate the merits of having Satoshi’s true identity revealed to the public. “Wouldn’t this be a negative development? Unless [Satoshi Nakamoto] has passed away already…” tweets Tom Lee, another famous Bitcoin enthusiast and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors. “You've spoken well about the importance of privacy in the past, describing it as foundational to universal human rights. It's not clear how 'outing' Satoshi Nakamoto is consistent with those ideas, either for the individual concerned or in general,” adds A. Hannan Ismail, Senior Adviser for South-South and Triangular Cooperation at the United Nations. Additionally, many wonder how McAfee managed to unmask Nakamoto when so many before him failed. “People forget that I am a technologist,” he told Bloomberg. “I am one of the best.” But there is a silver lining: if what McAfee is claiming is true and he has indeed found Satoshi, at least McAfee additionally claims it’s not Craig Wright, commonly dubbed Faketoshi. The whole story was prompted by Wright serving legal papers to the individual behind the Twitter account @Hodlonaut and threatening to sue them for libel due to them calling him “Faketoshi” and a “fraud.” Partly in response to this, McAfee decided to go on a hunt for the real Satoshi. “My entire life I’ve been tracking people who are the best in the world, and hiding their identity,” he added. “Finding Satoshi was a piece of cake for me.”"
0," Specialist blockchain and artificial intelligence investment firm Final Frontier announced that they were partnering with infrastructure provider for Bitcoin mining Bitfury to launch a Bitcoin mining fund, designed to give investors “convenient access to Bitcoin mining.” The fund is set to bring Bitcoin closer to mainstream adoption through providing investors with a way to participate in mining “in a confident and responsible manner,” according to Bitfury's executives.  The fund is in a European jurisdiction and is under the supervision of Liechtenstein’s financial regulator. Valery Vavilov, CEO of Bitfury, said in the press release, “With this innovative fund, Final Frontier is providing investors with a novel way of accessing Bitcoin mining opportunities, creating financial opportunities and furthering institutional adoption of Bitcoin.” The fund invests in turnkey assets comprised of mining sites with some of the lowest electricity and operating costs globally that feature state-of-the-art Bitfury datacenters, according to the announcement. The sites are scouted and operated by Bitfury, it added. A spokesperson from BitFury declined to comment on the size of the fund. “With the Bitcoin price down significantly from its all-time high, yet institutional interest growing every day, now may be an opportune time to consider investing in Bitcoin mining,” said Imraan Moola, co-founder of Switzerland-based Final Frontier.  The timing also goes hand in hand with the profitability of Bitcoin mining. Cryptocurrency analyst Alex Krüger said on Twitter that the current breakeven cost for Bitcoin mining is somewhere between USD 3,550 and USD 4,350, while the price of the asset is c. USD 5,500 as of the time of writing, which brings profits at above USD 1,000 per coin mined.  The bitcoin mining operational breakeven for efficient mining operations currently stands around $3550. pic.twitter.com/gQrNYBcvLH Bitfury Group was recently valued at USD 1 billion after it raised USD 80 million in a “private placement” investment in November 2018. The company also holds a minority stake in Final Frontier, as well as providing hardware and end-to-end services for the fund.  Institutionals are already looking into ways to enter the crypto space. One of the popular ways this year seems to be through endowments: a survey recently showed that out of 150 participants, 94% said that they have participated in crypto-related investment activities in the past year. Out of those, 54% invested directly, while the remainder had gone through a fund. Even major Ivy League university Harvard has dipped into crypto, according to reports, having invested directly into decentralized computing network Blockstack’s token sale."
0," Two-thirds of 10,000 surveyed Europeans believe cryptocurrencies will still be around in ten years’ time, but they’re less sure about Bitcoin itself, a new research by cryptocurrency exchange bitFlyer showed. However, barely a tenth of the respondents believe crypto will be used as a currency in the future.  The online survey, done through Google Surveys, included a total of 10,000 respondents, evenly spread over 10 European countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, and the UK. However, the profile of the respondents is unknown and it's not clear how many of the surveyed Europeans own cryptocurrency. In either case, respondents from Norway were the most optimistic ones, with 73% of respondents positive about the future of the industry, while 55% of respondents from France believe the same, putting the country at the bottom of the list. Still, this shows that in all the countries participating in the survey, the majority believes crypto is here to stay. The percentage of consumers who believe cryptocurrencies will still exist in 10 years’ time: In what form crypto will exist in a decade remains a mystery to most, as only 8% believe it will become a currency, while only 7% believe it will be used as an investment or security. Only Poles believe crypto might have more of a future as an investment or security than as a currency. The percentage of consumers who believe bitcoin will exist as an investment and security tool in 10 years’ time: Although the majority of respondents in each country believes crypto will be around in the future, the same optimism does not apply to Bitcoin itself. Italy is the most optimistic country on the list with 55% of respondents positive about Bitcoin’s future, while France is at the bottom with only 40%. A total of four countries are below the half line: France, UK, Belgium, and Denmark, while the others teeter close to the middle ground. The percentage of consumers who believe bitcoin will indeed exist in 10 years’ time: “The fact that Bitcoin is not generating as much support as other cryptocurrencies is in part a symptom of the market’s volatility, but is also a direct impact of the constant media attention that is associated to its volatility,"" Andy Bryant, COO at bitFlyer Europe, said, adding that this research shows there is much more to be done to demonstrate to consumers the benefits of and use cases across all cryptocurrencies more widely. “The next step is for the industry to better promote the benefits and use cases of cryptocurrencies to consumers, so that people understand how they will come to be used in society,” Bryant said."
1," The cryptomarket is rallying today from the emergence of a Bitcoin golden cross. Now, the majority of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap are in the green according to CoinMarketCap. Leading the rally with a 5% gain at the time of writing is Bitcoin (BTC). The current price of $5,599 USD per coin is a new high for Bitcoin in 2019, and the bulls are excited. But the news gets better for Bitcoin fans because, as stated, the first Bitcoin golden cross since October 2015 has formed. A golden cross is a technical chart pattern that indicates a major rally is on the horizon. According to Investopedia: “The golden cross appears on a chart when a stock’s short-term moving average crosses above its long-term moving average.” So with this bullish signal, Bitcoin looks set to change to a “long-term bearish-to-bullish trend.” If it can close above the $5,500 mark today, Bitcoin could rally to $6,000 USD in the coming days. The Bitcoin golden cross isn’t the only signal to indicate a rally. Tom Lee’s Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI) is spurring on the positive sentiment also. Recently the Fundstrat Global Advisors founder stated that his company’s Bitcoin sentiment indicator recently touched a value of 89. According to his expertise, this means a “bull market is likely starting.” Lee noted that the BMI was over 50 throughout 2018 and has never appeared in a bear market. April has been a good month for Bitcoin price. Growing 35% already in this month, the Bitcoin golden cross now signals further gains to come. This growth spurt means Bitcoin is on track to have the best month since December 2017, when the Bitcoin frenzy was in full swing. >> IIN Blockchain Expanding: How JPMorgan Wants to Improve Banking As is usual with the cryptocurrency market, where Bitcoin goes, altcoins often follow. Other major gainers in the top ten today include Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Cardano (ADA), up 3.52% and 2.5% respectively. The second largest coin by market cap, Ethereum (ETH), is currently up 2.17% and selling for $174.85 USD. On the other hand, Binance Coin (BNB) and Stellar (XLM) are down today, 2.17% and 0.29% respectively. What do you think?

1," Crypto researcher and analyst Willy Woo asked around in the crypto community what they think about the probability that the bottom is already in for this bear market. Taking all the answers he has into account, it seems that they believe there’s an average chance of 71.2% this is true. Meanwhile, a long-awaited golden cross appeared in Bitcoin charts, indicating the bull market. A total of 20 people responded to Woo’s survey, out of which two had notable comments picked out by Woo: one is trading veteran Peter Brandt, who said, “50% chance BTC goes to USD 50k. 25% chance we establish a very prolonged broad trading range for several years. 25% chance we go to basically zero,” and the other was Jesse Powell, co-founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, who said everything can go to zero at any time. The others make up an interesting list that is more or less bullish in nature: ________ As reported, New York-based research and consulting boutique specializing in the digital asset market Delphi Digital, claims that the Bitcoin bottom occurred in the first quarter this year, as there aren’t additional sellers coming.  Also, Adamant Capital has recently published a report on what could drive Bitcoin’s price going forward, regardless of the direction it might take. ""While lower prices are still possible, Bitcoin’s fundamentals are gaining momentum. Embraced by Millennials, its ecosystem is developing at rapid clip, both as a decentralized bottom-up disruptive technology, and as an uncorrelated, highly liquid financial asset for institutional portfolios around the world,"" the fund said. Today’s rally also seems to be indicating a possible upwards turn for the cryptocurrency as it has formed its first bullish golden cross since October 2015 - a candlestick pattern that is a bullish signal in which a relatively short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. It usually indicates a bull market and is reinforced by high trading volumes - which are at USD 16.3 billion as of the time of writing, while the price of BTC has increased around 5% in the past 24 hours and jumped above USD 5,500. Ladies & Gents... The Golden Cross! Bitcoin's 50-day moving average (gold) crossing above her 200-day moving average (blue). 📈This is yet another sign that we're back in a🐂market. 🚀🌛 pic.twitter.com/VK1PSsOYIB Others have different ideas, and economist and trader Alex Krüger is one of them: although he warns that his “maximum pain” scenario is not the most likely one: Maximum pain scenario for $BTC:- shoot through to $6000- rest right above $6000, luring longs in- dump back down to $4000s in 2 days- have everyone scream ""this is The End""- slowly move back up ""As Bitcoin edges back up, that previous USD 6,000 support level has now turned into resistance and is now firmly in the spotlight. A move back above here will bring the USD 10,000 level back in focus,"" added George McDonaugh, CEO of London listed digital asset investment company KR1.  However, he thinks that the most likely scenario is that Bitcoin will test USD 6,000, fail and head back down back towards USD 4,000.  ""I would expect the price to break through USD 6,000 on any second or third attempt and from there the aim would be to get back to USD 10,000,"" according to the CEO."
1," Yesterday, we discussed the chances of a fresh increase in bitcoin price above the USD 5,300 resistance. Today, BTC/USD gained bullish momentum and broke the key USD 5,350 and USD 5,400 resistance levels to start a strong upward move. The price even broke the USD 5,500 level and tested the USD 5,600 level. Ethereum price is also moving higher and it is currently (08:10 UTC) trading with a positive angle above the USD 174 level. On the other hand, ripple price is currently trading flat above the USD 0.322 support area, but it could start to climb higher in the near term. Total market capitalization  After forming a strong support above the USD 5,250 level, bitcoin price  climbed higher above the USD 5,400 and USD 5,500 resistance levels. BTC/USD is up more than 5% and it recently tested the USD 5,600 level. The price is currently correcting gains, but it remains well supported near USD 5,480, USD 5,450 and USD 5,420.
On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 5,560, above which the bulls are likely to push the price above the USD 5,600 resistance level in the near term. The next key barrier is near the USD 5,680 level. Ethereum price  is slowly moving higher and it recently formed a decent support base above the USD 170 level. ETH/USD is up more than 3% and it could continue to rise towards the USD 177 and USD 180 levels.
If there is an upside break above the USD 180 level, the price could surge towards the USD 190 level. On the downside, the main supports are near USD 170 level. Bitcoin cash price  followed BTC and jumped more than 5% above the USD 295 and USD 300 resistance levels. BCH/USD even spiked above the USD 305 level and it is currently consolidating gains. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 300, below which buyers are likely to defend the USD 295 support.
EOS  is moving higher and it recently broke the USD 5.25 and USD 5.30 resistance levels. The price is likely to test the USD 5.40 resistance, above which there are high chances of a rally above USD 5.50. On the downside, the key support is at USD 5.25.
Ripple price  seems to be forming a decent support near the USD 00.320 and USD 0.322 levels. XRP/USD must surpass the USD 0.328 and USD 0.330 levels to start a strong upward move in the coming sessions.     The recent bitcoin price rise boosted many small cap altcoins, including DGD, XTZ, ICX, AION, ADA, ELF, AOA, NULS, VEST and XVG. Out of these, DGD is up around 17% and XTZ climbed nearly 13%. Overall, bitcoin price is gaining bullish momentum and it could revisit the USD 5,600 and USD 5,700 levels. If there is a downside correction, buyers are likely to defend the USD 5,400 - USD 5,420 support area. Likewise, altcoins such as ethereum, bitcoin cash, EOS, ADA and BNB are likely to accelerate higher.

1," With bitcoin’s (BTC) move to five-month highs Tuesday, a notable bull cross of key moving averages has formed for the first time in nearly four years. The crypto market leader jumped to $5,627 on Bitstamp earlier today – the highest level since Nov. 18 – having revived the short-term bullish case with a repeated defense of key support at $5,170 last week. Meanwhile, the 50-day moving average (MA) has crossed the 200-day MA from below, confirming a long-term bullish pattern known as a “golden crossover” in technical parlance. This is the first golden crossover since October 28, 2015. Many analysts consider the indicator an advanced warning of stronger price gains in the long term. The crossover, however, is based on moving averages, which are backward-looking in nature. For instance, the 50-day MA is based on 1.5-month old data, while the 200-day MA responds to more than six-month-old price action. Hence, the indicator is more a confirmation of the recent bull run, rather than a signal of further price gains. That said, the investor community may take heart from the fact that bitcoin’s previous bull market began just two days after the golden crossover in 2015.  As can be seen (above left), the 50-day MA last crossed the 200-day MA from below on Oct. 28, 2015, and prices confirmed a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change with a close above $319 (July 12, 2015 high) two days later. The follow-through to that positive trend change was strong and BTC went on to reach an all-time high of $20,000 by December 2017. This time round, the confirmation of the golden crossover has been preceded by the violation of the bearish lower highs and lower lows pattern on April 2. While there is a reason to be optimistic, the golden crossover lags price, as discussed earlier. Further, it tends to work as a contrary indicator in the short-term if the market is looking overbought, which looks to be the case currently.  The cryptocurrency’s move to five-month highs has pushed the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) above 70 – a sign of overbought conditions. Hence, a price pullback cannot be ruled out in the short term. Supporting that argument is bitcoin’s long/short ratio, which has shed the bullish bias. The ratio of BTC/USD long to short positions on Bitfinex (right) is currently hovering just below 1.00 – the lowest level since early January – having printed a high of 1.53 on April 8. The sharp decline indicates the sentiment has turned from bullish to neutral over the last 15 days. Note that a reading well below 1.00 indicates a bearish bias, while an above-1.00 print represents a bullish market.  A close above the April 10 high of $5,466 would establish another bullish higher high and strengthen the case for a rally toward $6,000. However, with the golden crossover accompanied by the overbought readings on the RSI, as well as a bullish-to-neutral shift in the long/short ratio, prices may fail to close above $5,466 or the bullish close could be short-lived. The odds of a fallback to $5,000 would rise if today’s candle ends in the red well below $5,466, validating the lower high (bearish divergence) of the RSI.

1," If you want to buy things on Amazon using Bitcoin, you now can. All you need is the Bitcoin lightning network and crypto payment processing startup Moon. In time, the service will extend to many e-commerce sites also, not just Amazon. Let’s check this out. The startup announced today that any lightning-enabled wallet can now be used through Moon’s browser extension. Before this, the service could be used by connecting the browser extension to exchange accounts like Coinbase. According to Moon CEO Ken Kruger, it works like this: “[The extension] will pop up a QR code and it will have the lightning invoice, which you could also copy and paste if you can’t use the QR code for some reason, and you’ll be able to pay with your favorite lightning wallet.” Customers should note that Amazon has nothing to do with the Bitcoin payment. The conversion from Bitcoin to fiat currency is taken care of behind the scenes by an unspecified third party. Therefore, Amazon merchants receive fiat currency and never have to deal with Bitcoin, but the user gets to use Bitcoin as he/she so wishes. Kruger maintains that the lightning-enabled feature should work on almost any e-commerce site by 2020 as “there’s no direct merchant integration.” This is also regardless of whether that platform accepts Bitcoin directly. Aside from Bitcoin, Moon also manages payment channels, offering an interface for sending payments. As Kruger furthered: “We’re integrating with the Visa and Mastercard networks and we get a cut of the interchange fees that merchants pay every time they receive a credit card transaction.” >> Cryptocurrency Bear Market Wanes: Going through Accumulation Founded in New York last year, Moon is looking very promising. Born of a $100,000 investment, the company has already come quite far and is now looking for a Series A funding round in 2019. Further, the company is looking for “opportunities to help solve some of those usability problems” and to “engage with other folks in the lightning community to see what people are doing, what they’re working on and if there are any significant gaps. We’d love to step in and help whenever possible.” What do you think? Would you use Moon to buy your wares on Amazon? Featured Image: DepositPhotos © belchonock"
1," After independent developers pushed cryptocurrencies closer to giants such as Twitter and Whatsapp, another company just built a bridge towards online retail giant Amazon and is targeting other e-commerce incumbents such as eBay and Ali Express. Moon, a crypto payment processing startup’s service, announced that Coinbase users can shop on Amazon buy paying with Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash via the Lightning Network technology. ""Soon you’ll be able to shop on any of your favorite e-commerce websites, like eBay, Ali Express and Target,"" the U.S.-based company said on its website. Until now, beta users utilized Moon to pay with crypto on e-commerce sites, and they were able to do so by connecting the browser extension to exchange accounts such as Coinbase. However, thanks to Moon’s lightning feature, now any lightning-enabled wallet can be used through Moon’s browser extension, the startup explained. The extension’s Lightning Network support is pending Chrome Web Store review, it added. The company further stated that there are no fees for purchases made via Moon, that the payments are instant, that all data is encrypted, and that it is not a custodial service. Moon manages payment channels and provides an interface for sending payments. Meanwhile, after installing the extension, users are required to make an account. While making a purchase, they will receive a QR code from the extension, along with the lightning invoice, and they can pay with their lightning wallet of their choice. The extension will recognize the checkout process, and users just need to click “Pay with Moon” to complete the purchase. Not all e-commerce sites will accept cryptocurrency, which is why, through Moon, users’ bitcoin is converted into fiat and then transferred to the sites, though it is still unclear which traditional financial institutions will be doing the actual conversion. Meanwhile, other third parties have also started bringing cryptocurrency closer to other giants. Developer Sergio Abril launched Tippin, a new app for Chrome and Firefox browsers in February 2019, which lets users tip a certain tweet with Bitcoin via the Lightning Network.  Furthermore, Wuabit, a Spain-based independent startup, aims to launch a limited public beta of its crypto wallet for the popular messaging app WhatsApp this month, where it will be available through the chat interface, but also for other messaging apps such as Telegram, Facebook Messenger, as well as SMS, as Wuabit co-founder and CEO/CTO Manuel Polo previously told Cryptonews.com."
1," This past week, bitcoin price climbed towards the USD 5,400 resistance level. Later, BTC/USD corrected lower and recently tested the USD 5,150 support area. The price remains well supported on the downside and it seems like the bulls are sighting a fresh upward move in the coming sessions. Similarly, there was a downside correction in ethereum below the USD 170 support, but the USD 165 level acted as a strong support. Ripple price also corrected lower, but the USD 0.315 level prevented losses and XRP/USD recovered above the USD 0.320 level. Total market capitalization  Recently, there was a downside correction below USD 5,250 and USD 5,200 in bitcoin price . BTC/USD traded close to the USD 5,150 support area, where buyers emerged. The price bounced back and it is currently (08:10 UTC) trading above the USD 5,200 and USD 5,225 levels. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the USD 5,280 and USD 5,300 levels.
A successful close above the USD 5,300 resistance is likely to open the doors for more gains above the USD 5,350 resistance level. The main weekly resistance is at USD 5,400, above which the price may accelerate towards the USD 5,550 or USD 5,600 zone. Ethereum price  also corrected lower below the USD 170 support level. However, ETH/USD found support near USD 165 and it recently bounced back to USD 170.
The bulls need to gain traction above the USD 170 and USD 172 levels for a decent rise towards the USD 180 weekly resistance. On the downside, the main supports are at USD 165 and USD 160. A daily close below USD 160 might put a lot of pressure on the bulls. Bitcoin cash  failed to retain gains and declined sharply below the USD 300 support level. BCH/USD even broke the USD 290 level and tested the USD 280 support. The price is currently consolidating and remains at a risk of more losses below USD 280.
EOS  declined sharply below the USD 5.20 and USD 5.00 support levels. The price traded close to the USD 4.90 level and recently bounced back above USD 5.10. On the upside, there are many hurdles for buyers near the USD 5.20 and USD 5.30 levels.
Ripple price  trimmed most its gains and declined from the USD 0.340 swing high. XRP/USD broke the USD 0.330 support and tested the main weekly support near the USD 0.314 and USD 0.315 levels. The price recently rebounded above USD 0.322 and it could face sellers near the USD 0.328 and USD 0.330 levels. Despite bearish moves in bitcoin and ethereum, a few small cap altcoins moved higher by more than 6%, including DGD, BIX, FCT, REP, SC, MCO and NANO. Out of these, DBD rallied close to 12% and BIX is up around 8%. Overall, bitcoin is still trading in an uptrend above the USD 5,150 and USD 5,100 support levels. Only a daily close below USD 5,000 might negate the current bullish bias. If not, there are chances of more upsides in BTC and altcoins in the near term.

1," Bitcoin is in the last stage of this bear market, the accumulation phase, as we're back in ""undervalued territory,"" Adamant Capital, a Bitcoin alpha hedge fund, said in a report published today. It also provided six reasons why the price of the number one cryptocurrency might correct lower and listed three drivers that might increase the value of the coin. ""While  lower  prices  are  still  possible, Bitcoin’s fundamentals are gaining momentum. Embraced by Millennials, its ecosystem is developing at rapid clip, both as a decentralized bottom-up disruptive technology, and as an uncorrelated, highly liquid financial asset for institutional portfolios around the world,"" the fund said.  Adamant Capital was founded by Tuur Demeester, a popular economist and bitcoin-investor, who correctly predicted the crypto market drop last year. Now, they assert that the long term risk-reward ratio for Bitcoin is ""the most favorable of any liquid investment in the world.""  ""We expect for it to trade in a range of USD 3,000 to USD 6,500 after which we foresee the emergence of a new bull market,"" the report said, without providing estimations how long the accumulation phase may last. They added that this phase in the previous Bitcoin bear market lasted from February 2015 until May 2016 when when BTC traded in the USD 200 - USD 400 range. So what could possibly move Bitcoin? ""Given that no one exchange today has achieved the market dominance of Mt Gox at the time, a similar shock is unlikely. However, we still see exchange hacks or failures as the most important source of potential negative demand shocks for Bitcoin in the coming 6 months."" ""<...> we don’t see a financial crisis as a long term headwind for Bitcoin, on the contrary. <...> we believe that Bitcoin is of compelling value for investors looking to diversify their portfolios for protection against tail risks in both global bond and global stock markets."" ""Because of their large turnover and capacity to hold or sell coins, Bitcoin miners have an outsized influence on the boom-bust cycles of the industry."" ""Given the pending litigation it is unlikely but still possible that the Mt. Gox trustee begins distributing the 140,000 BTC that it currently has under man-agement. A significant percentage of this could then be sold by the claimants."" ""Historically [it] been a recurring fear factor in the Bitcoin space. However, we don’t think this is a  significant factor today."" ""<...> [It] should  be  considered  a  permanent  risk factor, given the disruptive nature of Bitcoin. Nevertheless, no serious pro-posals have been made in that regard.""
____ New solutions help Bitcoin to strengthen its positions as a lightweight, robust, and universally accessible protocol. ""As it matures, we expect for Bitcoin to disrupt the USD 100 trillion investment vertical of Liquid Store of Value, and become a globally used digital gold and reserve asset."" ""<...> surveys suggest that the majority of Bitcoin buyers are also Millennials, with mistrust of gov-ernments and growth outlook as the main motivations to buy. As the disposable income of Millennials continues to grow, we expect further tailwinds in terms of Bitcoin adoption and price appreciation.""
____ Also, Adamant Capital claims that supported by over 10 years of infrastructure development, the stage is set for mass market adoption in the coming 5 years.  ""In our assessment, during this phase (its “Windows moment”) Bitcoin will become widely recognized as a portfolio hedging instrument and reserve asset, and will begin making significant inroads as a payment network,"" they concluded. At pixel time (05:51 UTC), Bitcoin trades at c. USD 5,255, or 0.83% less than 24 hours ago."
1," Bitcoin recovery to its all-time high might take longer than Bitcoin bulls expect, an analyst at major Switzerland-headquartered international bank UBS warned, referring to historical charts of the previous asset bubbles.  ""Maybe crypto-bull contingents should consider what happens after the bubble - not every bubble that bursts recovers the old highs,"" Kevin Dennean wrote in his research note, according to Business Insider. Bitcoin reached its all-time high of almost USD 20,000 in December, 2017, but today, it’s 74% down from that number. According to the analyst, despite some Bitcoin bulls expect that the most popular cryptocurrency ""is ready to rise phoenix-like from the ashes just as other assets and indices did in the past"", it might take longer than many estimate.  Out of the examples Dennean gives in his note, all the asset classes (stocks, oil) collapsed by more than 75% from their peaks, except for one, but including Bitcoin, while only two recovered to previous levels. It is not easy to estimate how long it will take for Bitcoin to retrace its all-time highs, but presumably it will not be any time soon, according to Dennean: “We're struck by how long it took other asset bubbles to recover their peak levels (as long as 22 years for the Dow Jones Industrials) and how pedestrian the annualized returns from trough to recovery often are.” Decades later, some asset classes have still not recovered, the report said. Meanwhile, the crypto-Twitter has reacted enthusiastically to this news, not doubting Bitcoin’s recovering abilities, claiming that the analyst ""will be humbled"", according to Twitter user @mBTCPizpie. ""Make it 22 months!"" replies user @BTCradar. Others responded with good-natured humor to the idea of waiting several decades for Bitcoin to recover, posting memes - as people have come to expect, such as the “It’s been 84 years” Titanic meme, the “Ain’t nobody got time for that” meme, and a great many skeleton memes.   pic.twitter.com/6d9mF7Nn4Z Meanwhile, among the recent forecasters is trading veteran Peter Brandt, who correctly predicted the bear market of 2018, and now estimates that Bitcoin might reach USD 50,000 within the next two years.  Also, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of popular cryptocurrency trading platform BitMEX, has recently predicted that Bitcoin will more than double and reach USD 10,000 per coin this year. However, despite Bitcoin is up by almost 40% this year, Vinny Lingham, general partner at crypto fund Multicoin Capital and co-founder & CEO of Civic, an identity protection and management startup, said in April that the recent rally may very well be just another bounce before the next possible dip below USD 3,000."
1," Yesterday, we discussed a few important supports for bitcoin near USD 4,950 and USD 5,000. BTC remained well supported and recently climbed above the USD 5,100 and USD 5,140 resistance levels. The price even broke the USD 5,200 level and it is currently (08:10 UTC) correcting gains. Similarly, there was an upward move in ethereum above the USD 162 and USD 165 resistance levels. Ripple also rebounded and climbed back above the USD 0.320 resistance. Going forward, there could be a short term downside correction, but the crypto market is likely to bounce back. Total market capitalization  There was a steady rise in bitcoin price  above the USD 5,100 resistance area. BTC bulls managed to push the price above the USD 5,140 and USD 5,200 resistance levels. The price traded close to the USD 5,250 level and it is correcting lower. An initial support is at USD 5,160 and USD 5,140, below which the price could test USD 5,100.
On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 5,220, above which the price is likely to revisit the USD 5,250 resistance area. The next key resistance is at USD 5,320. Ethereum price  climbed higher after testing the USD 155 support. ETH recently broke the USD 163 and USD 165 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. It struggled to clear the USD 168 resistance and currently consolidating near USD 165.
On the downside, a break below the USD 165 support may push the price towards the USD 163 level. On the upside, the main hurdle for buyers is near the USD 170 level. Bitcoin cash price  climbed higher towards the USD 330 level recently and later retreated to USD 310. BCH/USD is trading in a range, with a strong support at USD 300. On the upside, there are many resistances near the USD 320 and USD 330 levels.
EOS  rebounded above the USD 5.40 level and tested the key resistance at USD 5.50 and USD 5.55, where sellers emerged. The price is moving lower towards the USD 5.40 and USD 5.35 support levels.
Ripple price  corrected higher and cleared the USD 0.315 and USD 0.320 resistance levels. XRP/USD even tested the USD 0.324 level and it is currently trading near the USD 0.321 level. On the downside, the key support is at USD 0.320, and resistance on the upside is near USD 0.324 and USD 0.325. In the past three sessions, many small cap altcoins recovered and climbed by more than 8%, including BIX, HOT, BAT, XTZ, WAX, CRO, KMD and NANO. Out of these, BIX is up around 13% and HOT climbed close to 12%. Clearly, the recent upward move in bitcoin pushed the price into a positive zone USD 5,140. BTC bulls now have to gain strength above USD 5,200 and USD 5,220 to push the price further higher towards the USD 5,320 level.

1," A new alternate reality puzzle game has a thousand keys barring the way to USD 1 million in Bitcoin all over the world, prompting players to organize themselves into teams, not unlike the ones in popular young adult book Ready Player One, in order to lay their hands on the prize. (Updated on April 17, 07:18 UTC: section ""That was easy"" has been updated.) A cryptic message broadcasted to the Blockstream satellite on April 13th was the challenge for all would-be players to participate in “Satoshi’s Treasure,” described as a contest to “test the resolve, courage, intelligence, and savvy of would-be hunters.” Received a new message over @Blockstream Satellite. It appears to be a treasure hunt for $1,000,000 in #bitcoin, with included GPS coordinates for the first part of the hunt! 🤯🛰️🔎🗺️ https://t.co/M4mKMbQ8KU pic.twitter.com/HzkEJ8RFXc A total of 1,000 fragments of the private key are hidden around the world, and at least 400 of those are needed to move the funds. Players can team up, organize hunts, and even sell their key fragments - there are almost no rules, and the ones that do exist even come down to common sense. The rules promise that the keys will not be hidden inside private property, and that Hunters should under no circumstances enter those areas if they have not been invited. They will also not require any destruction of property, and should a Hunter consider destroying a Key to prevent others from finding it, the creator promises to reveal all the keys this Hunter holds to everyone, thus disqualifying them. A total of 20 people participated in creating the game. One of them is Eric Meltzer, co-founder of venture investment firm Primitive Ventures, who also donated part of the loot. He was joined by Ian Miers, co-creator of privacy coin Zcash, and 18 other unnamed contributors in creating the game - all in order to ensure that none of them know all of the locations of the loot. The rest of the loot was capped off by an anonymous angel investor. The first clue seems to point towards satellites: “These locations can be discovered by monitoring the output of the primitive orbitals known in your time as GALAXY18, EUTELSAT 113, TELSTAR 11N, and TELSTAR18V at 1PM EST, APRIL 14th in the year 2019,” the clue reads. It goes on to add, “This is not history's first great hunt, nor its last, but it is MINE, and so it is to me that you must prove yourself. I have devised a series of puzzles and challenges of increasing difficulty; they will test even the most resourceful hunter or clan.” ""The response [to the first clue] has been absolutely overwhelming. People showed up to the 10 spots we indicated around the world where keys would appear en masse—some drove over 3 hours to get to a spot. Others figured out how to brute force the encryption we used and solved the clues without having to travel (something which we hoped would happen, but thought would take weeks—in reality it took 30 minutes..),"" Meltzer said in the Proof of Work newsletter.  According to him, people are forming teams, talking strategy, speculating on the value of keys and where the next clues will show up: ""Subreddits are being created. Telegram groups are forming. Our poor mongoDB is getting hammered with signups."" Meanwhile, GitHub (a platform for software developers) user John Cantrell revealed how he obtained the first three key shards in a few minutes.  ""I was shocked! That was easy,"" he said at the end of the detailed and technical explanation. Other clues will be revealed at noon PST (UTC-8) on Sundays and anyone interested in participating is free to sign up for notifications. Meltzer told news publication CoinDesk that they’re also considering an app to help players keep track of everything, but that it will not be required to play. According to him, most of the participants are very young, and a number of them are minors. Happy hunting!"
1," Yesterday, there was a fresh downside correction in bitcoin below the USD 5,050 and USD 5,000 support levels. However, the previous support near USD 4,950 acted as a strong buy zone once again. The price bounced back above USD 5,000 and it is currently (08:10 UTC) trading near USD 5,050. Similarly, ethereum and ripple extended losses and tested the USD 155 and USD 0.312 support respectively. Recently, both ETH and XRP recovered, but bulls seem to be facing a lot of hurdles on the upside. Total market capitalization  There was a downside extension in bitcoin price  below the USD 5,050 and USD 5,000 support levels. BTC dropped towards the key USD 4,950 support area, where bulls protected further declines. Later, the price rebounded above USD 5,000 and even tested the USD 5,050 level.
On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 5,100, above which the price is likely to struggle near USD 5,140. On the downside, the USD 5,000 and USD 4,950 supports are important, below which the price could decline to USD 4,860. Ethereum price  accelerated losses below the USD 160 support level and tested the next support at USD 155. ETH found strong bids and recently recovered above USD 160.
However, the price is facing many hurdles near the USD 163 and USD 165 levels. A successful close above the USD 165 level may perhaps open the doors for more gains above the USD 170 level. On the downside, the main support is at USD 155, followed by USD 150. Bitcoin cash price  rallied recently and broke the USD 300 and USD 310 resistance levels. The main reason was a sharp decline in bitcoin SV after a major cryptocurrency exchange, Binance confirmed that it will delist BSV. BCH may consolidate for some time before bulls attempt a push above the USD 320 level.
EOS  tested the USD 5.20 support recently and recovered above USD 5.30. The price needs to surpass the USD 5.40 resistance to revisit the USD 5.50 resistance area in the near term.
Ripple price  declined sharply below the USD 0.321 and USD 0.320 support levels. XRP/USD traded close to the USD 0.312 support level and recently recovered above the USD 0.320 level. On the upside, a break above USD 0.325 is required for an upside acceleration towards USD 0.330. In the past three sessions, many small cap altcoins trimmed gains and declined by more than 8%, including BSV, LAMB, KMD, HT, PAI, DGTX, WAX, IOST, LOOM and PIVX. Out of these, BSV is down around 21% and LAMB declined close to 16%. Overall, bitcoin price rebounded towards USD 5,050, but it must gain momentum above USD 5,100 and USD 5,120 to continue higher. If it fails to climb above USD 5,100, there is a risk of a fresh downside in BTC towards the USD 4,950 and USD 4,900 support levels in the coming sessions.

1," The stalled bitcoin (BTC) rally could again pick up the pace if a new resistance level above $5,200 is convincingly breached. The market-leading cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid at lows below $4,200 on April 2 and jumped to 4.5-month highs above $5,300 on April 8, confirming a bullish reversal. The rally, however, has stalled in the last few days, courtesy of overbought conditions and other factors, as discussed yesterday. Notably, the three-day chart’s 100-candle moving average (MA), currently at $5,238, has been proving a tough nut to crack since April 2. As a result, that lesser-known average is now the level to beat for the bulls. A convincing move above that MA resistance could bring in more buyers, reviving the prospects of the further rally. As of writing, bitcoin is trading at $5,080 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.5 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  The 100-candle moving average has recently been put to test for the first time since May 2018. Back then, the average was trending north, indicating a bullish setup and was located just above $8,400. As of writing, it is sloping downwards, representing a bearish bias, and is seen at $5,238. That bearish signal, however, is of little concern to the bulls, as longer duration averages are lagging indicators. That said, bitcoin has repeatedly failed to secure a three-day close above that average over the last 15 days. A break higher, therefore, may embolden the bulls and allow a sustained move higher toward $5,500. That, however, looks unlikely in the short-run, as the repeated failure at the 100-candle MA is accompanied by early signs of bearish reversal on the shorter duration charts.  BTC created a bearish outside reversal candle Monday – a pattern that occurs when the day begins on an optimistic note, but ends with pessimism. The candlestick is widely considered a sign of potential trend reversal, especially when it appears after a notable rally, as is the case with BTC. Traders, however, wait for confirmation in the form of strong follow-through, preferably a close below the candle’s low. So, a UTC close below $4,948 (Monday’s low) would shift risk in favor of a deeper drop toward the ascending 30-day MA, currently at $4,550. It is worth noting that the 30-day MA served as strong support throughout last month. A bearish close below $4,948 looks likely, as the 5- and 10-day MAs have produced a bearish crossover, validating the signs of buyer exhaustion seen on the weekly chart (last week’s candle was a doji). That said, the longer duration outlook will remain bullish as long as prices are trading above $4,236. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

0," The deadline for filing your tax returns is today, April 15th, if you’re a citizen of the United States - and while that’s always considered less than ideal news, it’s especially difficult if you trade cryptocurrencies, because the system is notoriously complicated - and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has never clarified their stance on six basic questions that every cryptocurrency owner wonders about.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has published a guidance on paying taxes on cryptocurrencies back in early 2014 and has not since updated anything, although the market has significantly evolved. For example, cryptocurrencies are not viewed as currencies at all, but as “intangible property,” similar to stocks.  Buying crypto with fiat is a non-taxable event, along with gifting the equivalent of USD 10,000 per recipient, or transferring coins between wallets. What is taxable, however, is the sale of crypto either for fiat or for other cryptocurrencies, exchanging it for a service (or, well, paying with it), mining, forks and airdrops, and receiving compensation in crypto (or being paid in it). For now, cryptocurrency traders have to track all their transactions that fulfill any of the above criteria and calculate the amount they owe the government. Additionally, airdrops are an especially difficult matter, as the US-based authorities have yet to agree on what they really are. Recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) implied that airdrops could constitute securities, although there is no monetary investment being made in them. They are also a sticking point for tax purposes, making up one of the six main questions that the IRS needs to answer to make the tax process simpler to follow. As Cryptonews.com recently reported, Washington-based crypto-focused research and advocacy institution Coin Center published a report with six basic questions not clearly addressed in the 2014 guidance. These include how to calculate the fair market value of cryptocurrencies, how to track cryptocurrency transactions they’ve made, and how people should treat airdrops and forks. The report also offers solutions to these problems, like letting cryptocurrency traders use tax lot reliefs that are available to stocks and some other securities, instead of having to go through the onerous task of tracking each transaction by hand and then calculating how much tax they owe on those.  Airdrops and forks are also addressed, as there is always a possibility that a user is simply unaware of even having received new tokens, and Coin Center proposes taxing them only when they’re being sold, instead of making them subject to taxation at the moment of receipt.  Although not paying taxes because you think, “What’s the worst that can happen?” is generally not advisable, it is a good idea to know exactly what might happen. If, by the end of April 15th, you don’t file your return or get approved for an extension, you will receive a penalty that generally starts at 5% of your unpaid taxes, according to American personal finance company Credit Karma. This is also the case if the IRS discovers you have underreported your income. The amount you owe also generates interest over time. According Credit Karma, “If you eventually file but it’s more than 60 days after the due date (either April 15 or the Oct. 15 extension deadline), there’s a minimum late filing penalty. For returns that were due this year, that penalty is USD 210 or an amount equal to 100% of the tax you owe - whichever is less.” The IRS remains tight-lipped on all things cryptocurrency, only recently tweeting that, “To avoid the late-filing penalty be sure to file an IRS return or request an extension, even if you can’t pay the full amount owed.” They have also not publicly replied to the Coin Center report yet, even though it was sent to them through 21 members of Congress, led by Representative Tom Emmer, who had also lent a hand to Coin Center in creating the report. In the official statement published by Rep. Emmer’s office, he says, “The 2014 guidance by the IRS failed to address fundamental tax questions, and repeated requests to the IRS for additional clarity have been made by a variety of entities. It also indicates that rather than providing clarity, the IRS has instead increased enforcement activities against taxpayers who ‘misreport’ their cryptocurrency transactions.” Moreover, Americans have lost billions trading cryptocurrencies last year, but they don’t seem to intend to report that, according toa survey, even though they could claim a deduction."
0," This past week, we saw a strong downside correction in bitcoin and altcoins such as ethereum, litecoin, ripple, cardano, EOS, and bitcoin cash. BTC/USD even broke the USD 5,000 support before buyers appeared near the USD 4,950 level. Later, the price formed a decent support near USD 4,980 and slowly rebounded above USD 5,050 and USD 5,100 resistances. The price even broke the USD 5,125 resistance and tested the USD 5,175 resistance. Similarly, there was a decent rebound in ethereum and ripple above the USD 165 and USD 0.320 resistance levels. However, there many hurdles for buyers on the upside and any further gains won’t be easy. Total market capitalization  There was a solid rebound in bitcoin price  above the USD 5,050 and USD 5,100 resistance levels. BTC/USD tested the USD 5,175 level and it is currently (08:10 UTC) trading in a tight range. On the upside, there is a crucial resistance formed near USD 5,200. If there is an upside break above USD 5,200, the price could test the key USD 5,400 weekly resistance.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 5,050, below which the price may perhaps test the USD 5,000 weekly support area. Ethereum price  formed a strong support near the USD 160 - USD 162 area. ETH/USD climbed above the USD 165 resistance and recently tested the USD 170 resistance.
Buyers need to clear the USD 170 and USD 172 resistance levels to start a fresh increase towards the USD 180 and USD 185 resistance levels. On the downside, a break below the USD 160 level may call for more losses in the near term. Bitcoin cash  gained bullish momentum and broke the USD 290 and USD 295 resistance levels. BCH/USD is up more than 8% and it even broke the USD 300 level. At the moment, the price is consolidating, with support near the USD 295 and USD 292 levels. On the upside, the key resistances are at USD 310 and USD 325.
EOS  jumped back above the USD 5.35 and USD 5.40 resistance levels. The price is up more than 4% and it recently broke the USD 5.50 resistance level. The next key resistance is at USD 5.60, above which the price may revisit the USD 5.80 weekly resistance.
Ripple price  recovered recently above the USD 0.315 and USD 0.320 resistance levels. XRP/USD even broke the USD 0.325 resistance before it faced sellers near USD 0.330. The price must clear the USD 0.330 and USD 0.332 levels for more gains in the near term. In the past three sessions, a few small cap altcoins moved higher and gained more than 8%, including XTZ, LAMB, MXM, INB, NULS, ZIL, WTC, REP and PIVX. Out of these, XTZ rallied close to 17% and LAMB is up around 15%. To sum up, bitcoin price rebounded above the USD 5,000, but it is still facing a couple of important resistances near USD 5,200. A successful close above USD 5,200 and USD 5,250 is a must for a fresh increase. If not, BTC is likely to decline back towards the USD 5,000 or USD 4,950 support.

0," Bitcoin’s out-of-the-blue bounce over the $5,000 mark this month has prompted some predictable pontificating from price-obsessed people within and outside the cryptocurrency community. Investors who are long-cryptocurrencies have gleefully pronounced that the Crypto Winter, which began when bitcoin’s bubble burst at the end of 2017, is now mercifully over. The most optimistic are forecasting a rerun of bitcoin’s fall 2015 bounce from its prior post-bubble collapse, which sent it not only back above its 2013 high of $1,150 but all the way to a December 2017 peak of $19,500. At the same time, bitcoin skeptics have pointed to the seeming lack of fundamental news behind the price rise and declared it meaningless. Typical of the genre, Matt Novak at Gizmodo penned an angry screed titled “Bitcoin Surges 15% Overnight Because Nobody Learned Their Lesson After the Last Crash.” One of Novak’s insights: “To be clear, bitcoin is absolutely worthless by any real measure. It’s fake money that’s about as practical to use in the real world as Monopoly bills.” Readers won’t be surprised to hear that I disagree with Novak’s simplistic rant. But I’m also turned off by the knee-jerk cheerleading from crypto traders whenever bitcoin’s price bounces. There’s something fundamentally wrong with reducing the measure of bitcoin’s worldwide importance to a price metric that’s denominated in a fiat currency that its advocates hope to replace. It pushes the debate into an inane all-or-nothing binary set of predictions: bitcoin is either going to zero or “to the moon.” What matters is that 10 years after an unidentified software engineer created it, this decentralized system for recording sequences of transactions continues to do its job, block after block, with no authority in charge, no user able to alter past transactions, and no person or entity able to shut it down. The more this goes on, the more it reinforces the powerful vision behind bitcoin: a peer-to-peer, disintermediated system for exchanging value around the world. And in that context, we can also think of bitcoin the cryptocurrency – differentiated from bitcoin the system – as a unique, provably scarce digital asset that expresses the overall value in that vast potential. A point that’s lost on critics like Novak is that the longer bitcoin simply survives – in the face of the $90 billion valuation that stands as a de facto bounty for hackers to try to take it down, compromise its security or corrupt it – the more its overall value is confirmed. Bitcoin is progressively proving itself to be an unstoppable, digital system of global exchange, one that functions outside of the traditional national government-mandated system of currency and banking. That status is what gives bitcoin its value. Of course, the global impact of the bitcoin value exchange system, and therefore its worth to humanity, will be significantly enhanced if adoption advances to a much wider scale and it is used frequently in the world’s transactions. And, yes, a great deal of development work is still needed if it is to ever reach that point. (Some recent technological leaps such as the Lightning Network and the emergence of decentralized, non-custodial asset exchange technologies offer hope that this scaling challenge can be achieved, though nothing is guaranteed.) However, widespread adoption in payments is not necessary for bitcoin to have value. To understand why that’s the case, it’s useful to think about gold, to which bitcoin is often compared. Similar to bitcoin, gold is a mutually agreed store of value that, for all intents and purposes, lies outside the control of nation-state governments and banks. It’s not widely used as a day-to-day currency, but it does enjoy a widespread, shared belief in its value. Where does gold’s value come from? The answer is somewhat tautological: it comes from that same widely held belief, from a shared understanding in gold’s capacity to function as a depoliticized global system of exchange that’s free of manipulation. Sure, we tend to think of gold in terms of its material qualities: that it’s durable and that it’s shiny in a way that connotes beauty. But its lasting worth really derives from the more esoteric notion that human beings have for a long time deeply held a shared belief in its value. That belief has turned gold into a system for protecting property, a system used through the centuries by refugees, dissidents and investors for moving and storing value and for hedging against lost spending power. That we now have a digital version of this concept, one that’s designed for the borderless, internet-shaped world of the 21st century, is a big deal. When dealing with debates over bitcoin’s value, it’s also worth going a little way down the rabbit hole of thinking about what money actually is. Not everyone agrees on a definition, but I think it’s useful to think of money as a societally agreed system for storing and exchanging value. The system has to have certain properties for people to reach this agreement – it must fungible, durable, transferable, divisible, etc. – but it’s the agreement itself that gives it its value. Here, too, is where many of bitcoin’s detractors get lost. Fixating on the misplaced idea of money as a thing, they exclaim that bitcoin can’t have any value as it isn’t backed by anything. This, of course, also misses the fact that it is backed by the energy and other resources that miners spend to do the computational work needed to secure the bitcoin ledger. But the bigger point is that bitcoin’s value, as with all forms of money, comes from the existence of a wide agreement in its potential use as a store of value and medium of exchange. In bitcoin’s case, the agreement is arguably one that involves 35 million people, if Cambridge University’s latest survey of authenticated users is to be believed. This large level of participation is essentially why bitcoin holds a much greater value than the altcoins that are forks of its code. So, this is why bitcoin at $5,000 is important, not because it’s a sign of that new investors are coming to push up its price again, but because it validates the core proposition of bitcoin’s resilience and promise.

1," Yesterday, we saw signs of weakness in bitcoin and altcoins. BTC remained in a downward descend and broke the USD 5,240 and USD 5,120 support levels. Sellers even pushed the price below the USD 5,000 support area. It tested the USD 4,860 support area and recently recovered above USD 4,950. Ethereum too declined below the USD 174 and USD 170 support levels. ETH found support at USD 160 and it is currently (08:10 UTC) correcting higher. Ripple was under a lot of selling pressure and broke the USD 0.335 and USD 0.326 support levels. XRP is now trading below USD 0.320, with a bearish angle. Total market capitalization  There was an extended downside correction in bitcoin price  below the USD 5,300 and USD 5,200 support levels. BTC even broke the USD 5,000 and USD 4,950 support levels before buyers emerged near the USD 4,860 level. The price recovered recently above USD 4,950, but it seems be facing hurdles near USD 5,000 and USD 5,020.
A break above the USD 5,020 level might call for a test of the USD 5,075 resistance area. The next main resistance is at USD 5,180 and USD 5,200. On the downside, the USD 4,900 and USD 4,860 supports are very important, below which the price could move towards USD 4,500. Ethereum price  was under a lot of pressure and it declined after it broke the USD 170 support level. ETH even broke the USD 165 support and tested the USD 158 - USD 160 support area, where buyers emerged.
The price must stay above USD 158 - USD 160 to start a fresh increase. The price is currently correcting higher, but it could struggle to move above the key USD 170 resistance level in the near term. Bitcoin cash price  extended declines below the USD 280 support level. BCH/USD broke the USD 270 support level and even tested the USD 255 level. The price is currently recovering above USD 265, but it may face a strong resistance near the USD 275 and USD 280 levels.
EOS  nosedived below the USD 5.50 support level and traded close to the USD 5.00 support. It tested USD 5.05 and recovered above USD 5.25. The main resistance on the upside is near the USD 5.40 level, followed by USD 5.50.
Ripple price  reversed most its gains and broke the USD 0.332 and USD 0.330 support levels. XRP/USD even broke the USD 0.322 support and traded close to USD 0.313. The price remains in a bearish zone and it could test the USD 0.310 support. In the past three sessions, many small cap altcoins declined by more than 8%, including MXM, ABBC, KCS, ELA, MKR, BCD, HT, PAI, BTS, BSV, SNT, ONT, THETA and ZRX. Out of these, MXM is down around 11% and ABBC declined close to 10%. Overall, bitcoin price corrected sharply in the past three sessions and tested the key USD 4,900 and USD 4,860 support levels. BTC is likely to bounce back above USD 5,100, but if bulls fail to gain strength, there could be another drop towards USD 4,860 or USD  4,800 in the near term.

1," The prices of most major cryptocurrencies have nosedived – hours after Bitcoin rose above the USD 5,400 mark. As April 11 drew to an end in North America – and April 12 got going in East Asia – prices that had earlier been displaying noticeable signs of weakness continued to fall apace. BTC had tumbled below the key USD 5,000 mark before rebounding later (03:18 UTC). Altcoins were also hit hard, with the likes of Ethereum and Ripple suffering – although some tokens have made slight rebounds from their initial falls. Top 10 coins by market capitalization:
(03:18 UTC) Analysts had previously been enthusing about the market, with one pointing out that BTC and Ethereum trading volumes were reaching levels unseen since the bubble of 2017. Crypto volume in that latest leg up was as high as in peak 2017 bubble https://t.co/atpFX8CLqF However, many believe that selling pressure became too high for many investors when BTC hit the USD 5,400 point, leading to rapid price drops. Meanwhile, as reported, according to Vinny Lingham, general partner at crypto fund Multicoin Capital and co-founder & CEO of Civic, an identity protection and management startup, the recent rally may very well be just another bounce before the next dip.  There was more bad news to end the week on for the South Korean crypto-community. Cryptonews.com earlier this week reported on the reversal of the so-called kimchi premium – a phenomenon in 2017 whereby South Korean traders were paying up to 50% more than the international average for their tokens. In recent months, optimism has returned to the market as South Korean prices fell – meaning many were paying 1-3% less than global averages.  But per data compiled by Hanguk Kyungjae, the “kimchi bonus” may have been very shortlived indeed. South Koreans are now paying an average of 1.8% more for cryptocurrencies than users of overseas exchanges like Binance and Bitfinex. The same media outlet was positive about the outlook, however, stating, “The domestic market has been revitalized.”  However, Chinese are also paying premium these days. Elsewhere in South Korea, Bithumb – one of the country’s largest exchanges – has released the results of an audit following an alleged “insider job” hack worth some USD 13 million, said to have been carried out by disgruntled former employees. The company says an external auditor confirmed that no customer funds were lost in the raid. The auditor also seems to be convinced that Bithumb’s usage of cold wallets for customer funds is satisfactory. However, the company has taken a significant financial hit. Earlier in the week, a financial audit of the company’s operator BTCKorea revealed that Bithumb experienced a net loss of some USD 180 million in 2018 – a huge drop from net gains of almost USD 470 million in 2017. There was a silver lining, though, with Bithumb revenues actually climbing by 18%. The company is currently downsizing in South Korea, cutting its staff from over 300 to nearly half that amount, although it appears keen to continue expansion efforts into overseas markets."
0," Yesterday, there were bullish moves in bitcoin above the USD 5,250 and USD 5,300 resistance levels. BTC/USD even traded above the USD 5,400 level and formed a new multi-month high near USD 5,420. Recently, there was a sharp downside correction and the price declined below the USD 5,300 and USD 5,200 levels. The price tested the USD 5,100 level and it is currently consolidating losses. Similarly, there was a downside correction in ethereum and ripple. ETH traded below the USD 175 support and XRP declined below the USD 0.340 support area. Total market capitalization  After bullish continuation above the USD 5,350 level, bitcoin price  faced a strong selling interest above the USD 5,400 level. A new yearly high was formed near USD 5,420 and recently the price corrected lower. It broke the USD 5,300 and USD 5,200 support levels. 
Buyers appeared near the USD 5,100 level and the price is currently trading near the USD 5,130 level. On the upside, the broken support at USD 5,200 may act as a resistance. On the downside, a break below the USD 5,100 level might push the price towards the key USD 5,000 support area. Ethereum price  declined sharply from well above the USD 180 level and broke the key USD 175 support. ETH is down more than 5% and it is trading below the USD 170 level.
An immediate support is at USD 165, below which there is a risk of a downside extension towards the USD 160 level. On the upside, the USD 175 level could act as a strong resistance. Bitcoin cash price  failed to stay above the USD 300 and declined heavily. BCH/USD broke the USD 285 and USD 280 support levels. The price is down around 7% and it seems like it could test the main support at USD 265 in the near term.
EOS  traded close to the USD 6.00 resistance and declined below the USD 5.80 and USD 5.70 support levels. The price tested the USD 5.50 support level and it remains at a risk of a downside extension towards the USD 5.35 level.
Ripple price  is down more than 5% and it broke the USD 0.345 and USD 0.340 support levels. XRP/USD is trading below the USD 0.338 level, with supports near the USD 0.332 and USD 0.330 levels. On the upside, the previous support at USD 0.340 may now act as a resistance. In the past two sessions, many small cap altcoins corrected lower by more than 8%, including IOST, NULS, LRC, REP, WTC, STRAT, PIVX, AION, STEEM, ARK, ZIL, TRX and PAI. Out of these, IOST, NULS, LRC, REP and WTC are down more than 10%. The current price action is slightly bearish and suggesting more downsides in bitcoin towards the USD 5,000 support level. Once the current correction is complete, BTC price is likely to rebound above USD 5,200 and USD 5,250 in the near term.

1," The cryptocurrency top ten are in the green! Well, eight of them are at least. According to CoinMarketCap, the total cryptocurrency market cap today is $182,807,737,820. As usual, when Bitcoin price is in the green, the rest of the market tends to be too. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is showing gains of a respectable 1.13%—a continued increase from a bull run now lasting over a week. Further down the chart, EOS is running away with a 6.84% increase. What has Bitcoin in the green as of late? The entire market is bullish so let’s check out why this is. At the time of writing, Bitcoin price is $5,285.08 USD, up 1.29% at the time of writing. Bitcoin has been on a bull run since April 2nd and not only has maintained the high but has continued to steadily increase. Over the course of a few hours on April 2nd, Bitcoin jumped from approximately $4,110 to $4,800. Now it has hit a current high of over $5,285. The rally has extended throughout the market with other coins also showing massive growth. For example, Litecoin gained over 50% and Bitcoin Cash roughly 80% in the same period. Two theories have emerged as to what caused Bitcoin to suddenly jump. The first is that $100 million worth of BTC was bought across exchanges Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp by one person. A sudden pump of money into the market spurred on further bullish sentiment, and the gains have continued. >> How Cryptocurrency Traders Benefit from Blockchain Technology Another theory is that because Bitcoin mining rewards will “half” in May of 2020, interest to buy BTC has sparked. The idea is to accumulate it now for the future when Bitcoin will be harder to mine and therefore become more scarce. As with any product, when it becomes more scarce, it becomes even more valuable. When mining rewards do halve in 2020, Bitcoin price can be expected to jump. So far in Bitcoin’s history ‘Halving’ has occurred twice–once in 2012 and once in 2016. What do you think? Do you have you a theory for the recent bull run? Featured Image: DepositImages © AntonMatyukha"
0," Cryptocurrency investment is on the rise right now, especially due to the recent Bitcoin uptick. BTC’s recent climb attracted Chinese investors, but they’re paying a premium price because they have to pay extra to purchase over the counter. China previously banned cryptocurrency exchanges from operating within its borders and also banned crypto trading. However, Chinese crypto investors have been using OTC platforms to access the cryptocurrency markets. The downside is that they have to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at a higher price than the officially listed market value. Some of the OTC platforms include Huobi and OKEx, among others. The recent surge in the price of Bitcoin seems to have revived the cryptocurrency investment appetite of Chinese investors, who have kept off the market for quite some time during the lengthy bear market. The return of Chinese investors to the Bitcoin investment scene has led to speculation that they had something to do with the surge. A cryptocurrency researcher called Anton Pagi stated that the Bitcoin surge happened after a notable uptick in trading volume on exchanges that have been associated with Chinese traders. Pagi even referred to a data analysis chart provided by CoinLib, a data analysis provider. The chart showed that there was a large Chinese fiat investment into Bitcoin and other digital currencies. >> Cryptocurrency Witnesses Better Returns than Equities This Year A news outlet called cnLedger revealed that Chinese cryptocurrency investors have recommended a ‘strong buy’ rating on Bitcoin. It also reveals that Chinese investors are using over the counter platforms as their main avenue of purchasing cryptocurrencies. Chinese investors are reportedly so confident about their bullish approach that they are willing to purchase cryptocurrencies at premium prices. There is a high likelihood that the average bullish outlook and premium Bitcoin purchases are behind the recent surge in Bitcoin prices. Chinese investors have thus been positioning themselves to take advantage of the bullish market. Featured image: Pixabay"
0," China’s state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission, is seeking public opinions whether Bitcoin mining should be immediately banned, Reuters reported, citing the Commission. (Updates throughout the entire text.) Bitcoin mining has been included in a draft list of industrial activities the agency is seeking to stop, as they did not adhere to relevant laws and regulations, were unsafe, wasted resources or polluted the environment, the report said. The public can comment on the draft until  May 7. Chinese miners are major players in the Bitcoin mining industry. For example, at the time of writing, two largest mining pools - BTC.com and AntPool (both owned by Chinese mining hardware giant Bitmain) - hold almost 32% of the Bitcoin network hashrate, which essentially measures how much computing power is needed to maintain the network. Hashrate distribution If the new rules are enacted and Chinese miners will be forced to move to foreign countries, ""Bitcoin mining will no longer be dominated by China but become more decentralised,"" Michael Zhong, an analyst with Beijing-based cryptocurrency research firm TokenInsight, was quoted as saying by South China Morning Post. ""If this ban does end up happening its more likely to push BTC prices up than down. The loss of cheap Chinese electricity would raise the mining cost, which is net positive on price. It would also serve to kill the FUD that Bitcoin mining is centralized,"" Mati Greenspan, senior analyst at social trading platform eToro, tweeted. Following the news, Bitcoin is up by 0.29% in the past hour (07:16 UTC) and is down by 0.19% in the past 24 hours. The move by the Commission marks growing government pressure on the cryptocurrency sector. A year ago, articles from influential state-run media outlets signaled that further crackdowns could be launched to force out remaining cryptocurrency trading and mining activities from the country. However, until now, miners have shown a surprising resilience. Moreover, the upcoming rain season in China should once again bring low electricity prices revitalizing the crypto mining industry. Nonetheless, many of those mining companies were looking to relocate to more favorable locations overseas such as Iceland, Canada, and the US, to name a few. Also, there are concerns that China holds more influence over Bitcoin than many are ready to admit. China ""threatens the security, stability, and viability of Bitcoin” with its “political and economic control over domestic [cryptocurrency] activity, and control over its internet infrastructure,” a study, published in October 2018, from Princeton and Florida International Universities claimed. “If the Chinese government assumed control of domestic hash power, this property would grant them an advantage in selecting blocks for the ledger, which is important for some types of attacks,” according to the research. It defined four attack classes: censorship, deanonymization, weakening consensus, disruption to competing mining operations. In total, the academics identified 19 different attacks available to Chinese mining pools. ""In theory it's possible for a government to launch a 51% attack. If a government like the US or China decided they wanted to hurt Bitcoin, they could either rapidly shut down a lot of mining power so that they control a majority of what's left, or they could deploy new hashpower that takes over the network,"" Prof. Matthew Green of John Hopkins University told Cryptonews.com recently. However, he doesn't regard a 51% attack on Bitcoin as especially likely though, due to the enormous expense involved.  ""The thing to keep in mind is that 51% attacks, while they're terrible and undermine confidence, basically just allow double spending,"" says Green. ""This is really bad for merchants and exchanges, and in the long run it could make Bitcoin unusable. But it doesn't allow the attacker to, say, steal everyone's coins. And the cost of a rollback goes up as you go farther back in time.""
_____ Crypto Twitter: Yep. Sichuan, Yunnan, Inner Mongolia. ""China says it wants to eliminate bitcoin mining""#Bitcoin Fud pic.twitter.com/t11kNWD695 It just means that most of the hashpower will move across a border, some will go ""underground"" in China, tucked into backrooms of old factories. Cost of coin production might go up, but that doesn't affect coin price at all."
1," With the price of cryptocurrencies recently rallying, they’re also gaining more traction, and many more people are making transactions and thus spending transaction fees. Of course, due to the law of supply and demand, transaction fees get more expensive - but there are ways that you can make sure that you don’t overpay them, especially if you’re not in that much of a hurry. Transaction fees are included with your bitcoin transaction in order to have your transactions processed by a miner and confirmed by the Bitcoin network. Simply put, they’re payment to the miner for including your transaction into a block. Since there is only 1 MB of space for transactions within a single block, the more you are willing to pay - and thus outbid other users - the more likely you are to have your transaction picked up by a miner.  Of course, this means that there is a competition among users of the network to make sure their transactions are going through as soon as possible, even if it means overpaying. Bit Consultants, a Bitcoin education and consultancy organization, suggests that users are needlessly overpaying - more than would be strictly necessary to have your transaction included in the next block. However, you could be overpaying for transactions even if you’re not doing it on purpose: wallet developers are often incentivized to make their users pay the highest transaction fees in order to evade customers complaining about their transactions not going through. Fee calculations are horrible. Electrum suggesting 90 sat/byte with an almost empty mempool. So many people paying too much on fees. pic.twitter.com/0GSsyQuzIX Most cryptocurrency wallets have the option of adjusting the fee when sending a transaction, but there is a drawback: you risk having to wait longer for your transaction to be included in a block. “Spenders willing to wait a bit longer can still save money,” Bitcoin Optech, an organization that helps Bitcoin users and businesses integrate scaling technologies, wrote in a recent newsletter, adding, “For example, as of this writing [April 2nd], Bitcoin Core’s fee estimator suggests a fee of 0.00059060 BTC [USD 2.9] per 1,000 vbytes confirmation within 2 blocks but only 0.00002120 [USD 0.1] for confirmation within 50 blocks - saving over 95% for waiting up to an extra 8 hours.” However, the fee estimator still adds that, “Because of the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network and the fact that there is sometimes congestion in the available block space (because of the 1 MB limit), the amounts shown here are probabilistic and there are no guarantees that they will work.” All of these transactions are overpaying fees. Even at these levels next block fee is only 0.00003100 BTC ($0.15).Fees aren't high, the fee estimators are...1. Use wallets with custom fees, RBF, and CPFP2. Manually check mempool before each tx3. Optimize for next block. pic.twitter.com/axbUGbovwO Bit Consultants offers a simple solution: use wallets where you can set a manual fee amount, that support Replace-by-Fee (RBF) and Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) features. Replace-by-Fee is the replacement of an existing, unconfirmed transaction with a new one, identical except for the fee, which is usually higher to boost the chance of it being confirmed soon for when you can’t wait any longer.  Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) is a feature which allows the receiver of a transaction to spend the unconfirmed funds they are expecting. The reason this is helpful is because if you are waiting on a transaction that is stuck because the transaction fees are too low, you can simply send the unconfirmed funds to a different wallet address, with a higher transaction fee. The higher fee will have miners pick up the new transaction and the old as well, and both will be confirmed within the same block.  If you’re more tech savvy, Bit Consultants also recommends checking the mempool by yourself. The size of the mempool is the aggregate size of transactions waiting to be confirmed. If it does not have a very big backlog, there is simply no reason for you to pay more than the minimum - your transaction will get picked up simply because there are not enough other transactions to gain precedence. Mempool size:"
1," After Bitcoin broke through USD 5,000 last week, many believe that the crypto market might be out of its winter woods: investors are increasing their holdings, Chinese are buying bitcoin at premium, and a well known trading veteran forecasts bitcoin at USD 50,000 within the next two years. The founder of the blog Factor Research and Trading Peter Brandt, who correctly predicted the bear market of 2018, now draws parallels between two previous rallies.  “What’s happened from December of 2017 to 2018 is really an analog to what happened in the 2013 to 2015 bear market, where we saw sequential 10 up-and-down moves in the bear market and we’ve almost identically formed that same sort of pattern,” Brandt told news outlet Yahoo Finance, later adding, “I think the analogs are holding remarkably well and based on those analog studies, I think cryptos now will go back into a parabolic bull market."" Either from Dec '18 low or from retest of same (circa analog dbl bottom in 2015) it would not surprise me if $BTC enters a new parabolic phase. $btcusd pic.twitter.com/XV89Qz7P4n ""The only question I have is do we rally here some and then sometime in late summer check the late 2018 lows or not? There is a chance that it does, there’s a chance that it doesn’t,” Brandt added. Watch the whole interview with Peter Brandt: ___ Meanwhile, founder of the crypto hedge fund Ikigai Travis Kling tweeted about how they sent out a monthly update on April 1st only hours before the pump, where they mull the effect of reflexivity on crypto. “Reflexivity is the theory that a two-way feedback loop exists in which investors’ perceptions affect the market environment, which in turn changes investors perceptions.” Due to bullish news from the beginning of this year, they wrote, “risky whales may be throwing that bucket as we speak,” reversing the downward trend. Also, Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told news outlet Bloomberg, “An instrument that can go back to its 200-day [trading average] and hold it is now back in a bull trend. So I think sentiment has to change, because Bitcoin is now in a bull market.” Moreover, retail investors in China are also becoming more active in the crypto market.  “China is awakening again and buying at 5-10% premiums the past few days,"" Su Zhu, CEO of fund manager Three Arrows Capital, tweeted, also sharing insights by @cnLedger, a Twitter account following cryptocurrency and blockchain in China. It claims that ""We are witnessing a resurgence in Chinese demand for cryptocurrencies. This trend in the making comes after more than a year of relative quiet, a reminder of the time when Chinese volumes were king."" 2/ Why the USDT premium going up? After the PBoC ICO/exchange ban, the most convenient way to buy cryptos in China, is to buy stable coins like USDT first using OTC, and then trade it into any cryptos you want in exchanges. Meanwhile, in South Korea, it seems that the famous Kimchi Premium has been replaced by the ‘Korean Bonus’.

1," UPDATE (9, April 00:09 UTC): Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, CEO of BCB Group was given a right of reply to defend his statements regarding his findings as cited by Reuters. ——— Mainstream news coverage of cryptocurrency is often disingenuous or factually incorrect – that’s certainly no surprise given the nascent technology is widely misunderstood. But if one would have thought that recent milestones – bitcoin’s 10th anniversary, the arrival of crypto projects from the likes of JP Morgan and Facebook – would have encouraged the media to get smarter, this week’s news shows attitudes at major publishers haven’t changed much.  This is especially true during times of heavy market activity like that of bitcoin’s April 2 breakout, which saw its price rise 17 percent over a 30-minute period. As CoinDesk readers know, the move was foreshadowed by changes in market data and sentiment. With volatility hitting multi-year lows, multiple technical indicators flashings signs of a bottom and fundamental catalysts (the upcoming halving) combining, there were plenty of developments that signaled a change might be on its way.  Still, far from examining developments (or asking serious questions), much of the mainstream media’s coverage devolved into outright theory and speculation.  Here’s the worst of what was a genuinely bad bunch.   While articles like these from Gizmodo are useful in gauging retail sentiment – ie, determining where the average Joe sits in terms of understanding and valuing cryptocurrency – they, unfortunately aren’t useful for anyone who wants to be informed. Writers like Matt Novak have a point – novice retail investors were given a bitter taste in 2018, when the market for cryptocurrencies took a turn for the worse. Still, that’s no excuse for not educating yourself or your readers, who, without such learning, may repeat mistakes.  The article reads: “To be clear, bitcoin is absolutely worthless by any real measure. It’s fake money that’s about as practical to use in the real world as Monopoly bills. Bitcoin is backed by nothing and requires tremendous amounts of energy to mine using computers.” Without spending too much time on this statement, there are a few incorrect passages, that in particular, don’t ring true. For one, bitcoin definitely can act as a medium of exchange. It can be, and today is used to facilitate the commerce and trade of goods between parties, a core fundamental function of modern money.  Next, it’s backed by the computer operators that mine the network itself, all of whom invest real dollars, manpower and equipment in ensuring the network is functional.  Finally, while the cost of mining bitcoin remains high thanks to its large energy consumption, this does not mean it cannot run off renewable energy and take advantage of natural events that reduce the cost and lessen the impact to the environment.  It seems mainstream media tends to forget that the cost of mining bitcoin’s physical competitor, gold, is perhaps even more guilty of harming the earth’s environment as its miners regularly tear apart massive landscapes and leave behind loads of toxic waste. To state that this will forever be bitcoin’s final form borders on ignorance as well, as we have seen time and time again that the evolution of technologies usually comes from a solution to fix a specific problem.  One of the least offensive of the bunch, a Reuter’s report that cited a solo “mystery” buy order as the main cause for a huge price spike still offered a confused take by focusing in on a sole market irregularity.  In particular, it highlights a claim made by the chief executive of cryptocurrency firm BCB Group, Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, who argued the case that the move was the responsibility of a single buyer. The article reads: “Today’s gain (April 2) was probably triggered by an order worth about $100 million spread across U.S.-based exchanges Coinbase and Kraken and Luxembourg’s Bitstamp. There has been a single order that has been algorithmically-managed across these three venues, of around 20,000 BTC.” This is hard to corroborate with independent analysis as the article did not provide evidence of the orders, merely statements that negate other factors.   As the price climbed higher, this resulted in a snowball effect of buying as shorts were closed and limit buy orders were triggered, causing its price to rise faster and higher.  Using an hourly view of bitcoin’s price we can see just how much volume was recorded during a single trading period by looking at the volume bars and order books and then noting their readings. At 4:00 UTC on April 2, Coinbase recorded a total of 6,889 units in a single hour and Bitstamp handled close to 3,798 units while Kraken had the least at 4,121 bitcoin units traded in the same hour. This created a total of 14,808 units traded in the hour of the surge, yet Reuters and CNBC claimed 7,000 units were purchased on each of the three different exchanges in tandem by a single entity at the time of the surge. Needless to say at the time the numbers didn’t quite add up. Also of note, data shows that growing buy volume began to increase substantially across most major exchanges, not just the three highlighted in the article. However, Oliver reached out to Coindesk in order to support his claim by providing the following:"
1," The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is known for their undecided stance towards cryptocurrencies - other than the fact that they should be taxed, nothing else seems clear to U.S. residents that hold crypto assets. To answer six basic questions often asked by cryptocurrency holders in the US, crypto-focused research and advocacy institution Coin Center published a report with recommendations on what should be done to solve those problems. The IRS has published a guidance in early 2014 that has never been updated and does not answer the questions below. “Rather than targeting ‘unintentional tax cheats,’ we are hopeful that the IRS will adopt our common-sense recommendations,” writes James Foust, senior researcher at Coin Center, in a commentary accompanying the report. According to existing regulations, only “convertible virtual currency” is treated as property, and it is defined as “virtual currency that has an equivalent value in real currency, or that acts as a substitute for real currency” in the guidance, in Notice 2014-21. The guidance only concerns convertible virtual currency.  Although Bitcoin is considered convertible, it is unclear how, by definition, one should categorize other types of digital assets, “such as those having attached voting or payment rights or other contractual rights or obligations, algorithmic stablecoins, airline rewards miles, and video game currencies for which there are official fiat markets - e.g., Second Life’s Linden Dollars - as well as video game currencies that are not meant to be traded for fiat but for which secondary black markets nevertheless exist - e.g., World of Warcraft Gold,” Coin Center points out. Coin Center’s report urges the IRS to first clarify whether the distinction between convertible and non-convertible assets makes a difference for tax purposes, and, in case it does, to clarify whether non-convertibles are taxed and how. Also, clearer guidance on how to separate the two should be issued. If the distinction is non-consequential, then it should be noted that Notice 2014-21, as well as any others, applies to both. To calculate whether a transaction resulted in a gain or a loss to the taxpayer, they must take the fair market value (FMV) in USD realized from the exchange and subtract it from the adjusted basis in the property being sold; the basis is adjusted by various provisions of the tax code.  Now, to the question: how does one calculate the FMV? The guidance states that, “If a virtual currency is listed on an exchange and the exchange rate is established by market supply and demand, the fair market value of the virtual currency is determined by converting the virtual currency into U.S. dollars (or into another real currency which in turn can be converted into U.S. dollars) at the exchange rate, in a reasonable manner that is consistently applied.” However, most cryptocurrencies are listed across several exchanges and their prices on each can differ - which one should they choose? What does the IRS consider “a reasonable manner that is consistently applied”? Because of market volatility and often slow processing time at exchanges, which price should the taxpayer take into account? Coin Center proposes that taxpayers should be left to choose whether they use the exchange rate data from one exchange, averaged data from a set of exchanges, or a third-party exchange rate index, as long as they are consistent in their choice. However, they also note that the “reasonable manner consistently applied” should only be explained, and there would be no need for an additional solution. Buying Bitcoin differs from one day to another, let alone from one month or one quarter of the year to another. This means that the assets are also differently taxed, depending on when they were bought. The intuitive solution would be to keep track of every single transaction and calculate it based on the circumstances of the day they went through. Coin Center calls this task “incredibly onerous but technically feasible” for users that hold their own private keys - but for those using hosted wallets, it may be completely impossible. Stocks and some other securities have other, simpler ways of determining tax lot reliefs, but cryptocurrencies seem to not be eligible to use those. Coin Center recommends that the IRS changes this decision to include cryptocurrencies, letting taxpayers choose tax lot relief methods the same way other commonly traded financial instruments can, and/or adapting those to be applicable in the case of cryptocurrencies. Charity donations in the US are deductible from the taxpayer’s income for that year, and cryptocurrencies are no exception. The deduction is usually capped at USD 500, while donations that warrant a deduction of USD 5,000 or more have to be appraised. There is currently no way to have cryptocurrencies become an exception from appraisal, due to the fact that they are not considered cash. In this case, the recommendation is to have the IRS provide guidance explicitly allowing taxpayers to use exchange data to value cryptocurrency donations - the same way they would calculate the FMV of their transactions - instead of going through a costly appraisal process. Perhaps the most famous example of a hard fork was the creation of Bitcoin Cash in August 2017. Anyone who owned Bitcoin before the fork received an equivalent amount of Bitcoin Cash after it. This is the case with all forks that result in new chains being created. Airdrops are a similar feature: to each holder of a certain token, creators of a new token can choose to give them these new tokens corresponding to the amount of the original tokens they hold. The new tokens are not sold, but simply given away, to people who are known cryptocurrency users and already hold tokens, which are often in some way similar to the ones they are receiving now. In both cases, recipients may be completely unaware of the existence of the new tokens, especially if the fork or airdrop went by unnoticed and without media coverage. Even if they are aware, what if they do not sell or trade the new tokens? What if they never access them, regardless of being aware of them? The report suggests that the new tokens should not be taxed if the owner does not dispose of them. If they do, then the income should be recognized at the moment of disposition, not the moment of receipt or the owner becoming aware of their existence, as these would be too difficult to follow. However, if users hold their tokens at exchanges, anything the exchange decides to do with these new tokens should not affect the taxpayers unless it was done at their own direction. In Notice 2014-21, it is stated that crypto payments are subject to the same reporting requirements as “any other payments made in property.” Current regulations state that every taxpayer holding financial assets exceeding certain thresholds in foreign countries need to report this to a specific institution, according to circumstances. However, Coin Center claims, it is unclear whether holding cryptocurrencies on an exchange that is not located within the United States falls under this guideline or not. It is also not clear whether assets could be treated as foreign financial assets if a counterparty to the transaction is not a US person. As the solution to this problem, it is suggested that the IRS needs to clarify whether cryptocurrencies are subject to these reports or not - there would be no need for changing anything in the current regulations. Meanwhile, this week, Democratic senator Ron Wyden proposed a new version of capital gains tax, where investors would pay taxes on the assets they hold every year when those assets gain value, instead of just when they’re sold. Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania has called it a “breathtakingly terrible idea,” according to a report by CNBC, and people seem to agree wholeheartedly. This new version of the tax could kill a lot of markets, but the cryptocurrency market is especially vulnerable due to high volatility. However, the idea would be incredibly hard to implement - but it would throw yet another wrench into the already confusing idea of cryptocurrency taxes. “This tax proposal [...] adds enormous complexity to a code that is already mind-numbingly incomprehensible,” writes Ron Insana, senior analyst at CNBC. At the beginning of this year, Goldman Sachs-backed cryptocurrency company Circle that is also a member of a lobbying group named Blockchain Association revealed that they’re working with the IRS on clarifying, and even setting up, the rules surrounding crypto-to-crypto payments taxation. “We believe there should be different tax treatment for crypto-to-crypto, especially for smaller payments oriented transactions. The leading government on this issue right now is France, where they are soon passing a law where there will be zero taxes on crypto-to-crypto transactions,” The company’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, said at the time."
1," Volume on the peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins shows that developed market volume is tracking price, while emerging market volume has stabilized and keeps growing without regard to price. This would imply that developed markets are speculating, while emerging markets use Bitcoin for utility, according to investment firm Passport Capital. Although volume in both markets spiked in December 2017 when Bitcoin reached its all-time high of almost USD 20,000, in subsequent times, they followed vastly different directions. Bitcoin volume in developed markets kept falling until it reached a low not seen since January 2016, and then started climbing again, partially in time with the recent market rally. Meanwhile, volume in emerging markets fell much less and has stayed in the same bounds since the middle of the first half of 2018 - and the more time went by, the more it stabilized. At @PassportCapital we continue to observe a divergence between LocalBitcoins volume in Developed and Emerging Markets. Volume in Developed Markets is tracking price (speculation) while volume in Emerging Markets has stabilized and is growing despite price (utility ) pic.twitter.com/RuOtGCWa0X The data implies that traders from developed markets are speculating on the price and trying to make money off market volatility, while traders in emerging markets are using Bitcoin for utility. Part of the reason might be the fact that developed markets have no need for Bitcoin as a payments system due to a relatively stable fiat currency in place (USD, EUR, JPY, etc.), while emerging markets usually have a more volatile fiat currency, so they tend to try and evade using it, opting for alternative payment methods wherever they can.  One such example - and the most commonly cited one - is Venezuela, where hyperinflation hit 80,000% in 2018, rendering the bolivar close to worthless. Venezuelans have been increasingly turning to the use of cryptocurrencies throughout the country’s socio-economical and political crisis, and the motivations behind this were part of the debate between American economist Nouriel Roubini and smart contract platform Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin at the Deconomy Conference in Seoul on Thursday. Roubini, for example, maintains that the adoption of cryptocurrencies in Venezuela is an exception and shouldn’t be seen as the inception of a hard and fast rule. Buterin disagrees: in his opinion, Venezuela's case was “more to do with cryptocurrencies than fighting inflation. It's about looking for alternative means of protecting one’s assets.”  Venezuelan Bolívar to US Dollar Rates “Nouriel's main point of ‘trust the system’ falls apart the moment you take these ‘exceptional’ events into account. For they aren't as exceptional as mainstream economists claim. We have a war every 50 years. Families migrate every 100. Finance collapses every 10,” reacted Cornell professor Emin Gün Sirer in a tweet.  And while Venezuela’s hyperinflation is certainly currently unparalleled in the world, many countries - the vast majority of them, if not all, belonging to emerging markets - face similar issues due to weak economies, corrupt governments, or even stifling sanctions. In that case, a decentralized, electronic, peer-to-peer payments system is certainly a better option than what they currently have in place, in spite of the former’s volatility - in some cases, this volatility is negligible compared to the alternative, and even with volatility and regulatory uncertainty surrounding digital assets, the choice becomes one for the lesser of two evils. Meanwhile, people in the emerging markets, such as Africa and Asia are actually starting to use cryptocurrencies for transactions, Magdalena Golebiewska, head of Eastern Europe region at Luno, a Bitcoin company boasting two million global accounts, previously told Cryptonews.com. According to her, it is estimated that in 2025 up to 50% of global population will live in the emerging markets. However, the sharp dip that developed market volume experienced on LocalBitcoins does not necessarily have to be completely attributed to speculations - developed markets usually have much better access to centralized cryptocurrency exchanges that remove the dangers of peer-to-peer trading. However, there is no definitive data to separate the two motives."
1," Yesterday, we saw a short term downside correction in bitcoin below the USD 5,000 level. However, BTC/USD found a strong support near USD 4,800 and later moved higher. The price is consolidating near the USD 5,000 level and it seems like there could be more upsides above USD 5,040 and USD 5,080 in the near term. On the other hand, ripple price gained bullish momentum and rallied close to 7%. XRP/USD broke the USD 0.360 level and it is currently (08:10 UTC) trading with a positive bias. Ethereum price also climbed higher and broke the USD 160 and USD 162 resistance levels. Total market capitalization  There was a strong buying interest see near the USD 4,800 level in bitcoin price . BTC remained well bid and the price recently moved above the USD 4,900 and USD 4,950 levels. However, the USD 5,000 level is acting as a resistance. The next key resistance is at USD 5,040, above which the price may rise towards the USD 5,120 level in the near term.
On the downside, an initial support is near the USD 4,920 level. If bulls lose control, there are chances of more losses towards the USD 4,800 support area. Ethereum price  formed a strong support near the USD 154 and USD 155 levels. ETH recovered recently and traded above the USD 160 and USD 162 resistance levels. The next key resistance is at USD 165, above which the price may rise towards the USD 170 level.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 160, below which buyers are likely to take a stand near the USD 155 support. Bitcoin cash price  started a significant downside correction from the USD 350 resistance. BCH/USD declined below USD 300 and it is currently consolidating above the USD 270 and USD 275 resistance levels. A fresh increase above USD 300 is needed for a push towards the USD 325 and USD 330 levels.
EOS  is slowly moving higher after testing the USD 5.00 support level. It is currently trading above the USD 5.25 level, with many resistances near the USD 5.35 and USD 5.40 levels. The main support is now at USD 5.10.
Ripple price  started a strong upward move today and broke the USD 0.350 and USD 0.355 resistance levels. XRP is up more than 6% and it may continue to rise towards the USD 0.375 and USD 0.388 resistance levels. The main stop for buyers could be USD 0.400. In the past three sessions, a few small cap altcoins climbed higher and gained more than 8%, including MXM, NPXS, XIN, PAI, QBIT, THETA, CRO and ENJ. Out of these, MXM is up more than 60% and NPXS gained nearly 17%. Overall, bitcoin price seems to be consolidating gains above the USD 4,900 and USD 4,800 support levels. To start a fresh increase, a proper close above the USD 5,000 and USD 5,040 levels is required. On the other hand, a break below the USD 4,800 support might extend correction towards the USD 4,650 level.

0," Yesterday, we discussed about further gains in bitcoin above the USD 5,180 and USD 5,240 resistance levels. BTC did move higher, broke the USD 5,150 resistance, and traded towards the USD 5,275 level. Later, there was a sharp downside correction below USD 5,000. However, declines were limited and the price is now back above the USD 5,000 pivot level. Ethereum and ripple also corrected lower sharply after trading to new yearly highs. Both ETH and XRP are currently (08:00 AM) trading above key supports and seem to be preparing for the next wave higher. Total market capitalization  There was a solid upside extension above USD 5,000 in bitcoin price . BTC traded above the USD 5,180 and USD 5,240 resistance levels and tested the USD 5,275 level. Later, it corrected below the USD 5,000 level and tested the USD 4,800 level. A strong buying interest emerged and the price bounced back above USD 5,000.
The price is currently consolidating near the USD 5,000 and it may climb higher towards the USD 5,150 or USD 5,200 levels. The next key resistance is at USD 5,275, followed by USD 5,350. On the downside, the main supports are near USD 4,920 and USD 4,800. Ethereum price  surged above the USD 170 resistance and traded towards the USD 180 level. ETH traded as high as USD 177 and later corrected sharply below the USD 170 and USD 160 levels.
However, the USD 155 level acted as a strong support and the price recovered above the USD 160 level. The price is trading above the USD 160 support and it may rise towards the USD 165 and USD 170 levels. Bitcoin cash price  gained a strong bullish momentum and broke the USD 285 and USD 300 resistance levels. BCH/USD even rallied above the USD 320 level and tested the USD 345 zone. Later, there was a downside correction, but the price is now back above USD 300.
EOS  tested the USD 5.00 support recently and it is currently trading above the USD 5.20 level. The current price action is positive and it seems like the price might continue to rise towards the USD 5.30 or USD 5.50 zone.
Ripple price  touched a new yearly high near the USD 0.370 level before it corrected lower sharply. XRP/USD tested the USD 0.330 level and it is currently placed nicely above the USD 0.340 level. The next key resistance is at USD 0.350, followed by USD 0.362. In the past three sessions, many small cap altcoins surged higher and gained more than 10% gains, including IOST, DOGE, INB, R, BIX, LSK, ONT, NAS, LTC and ELF. Out of these, IOST is up more than 28% and DOGE is up around 23%. The current technical structure suggests more gains in bitcoin above the USD 5,100 level in the coming sessions. If BTC trades past USD 5,150, it may even climb towards the USD 5,300 level. Conversely, if there is a downside correction, the price might test the USD 4,900 or USD 4,800 support levels.

0," Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market have started Q2 off with an emphatic bang, having at one point increased the market’s total capitalization by nearly $40 billion since the beginning of April.  Indeed, bitcoin led the market-wide charge on April 2, surging over 20 percent in a single hour – a move that had since extended to a 136 day high of $5,304 yesterday, according to data from CoinDesk’s price data.  A common byproduct of a rallying bitcoin, however, is diminished returns of the BTC denominated trading pairs of most other cryptocurrencies, as opportunistic investors tend to shift funds into the market leader when it picks up a bid.  Such was proven Tuesday when almost all of the top 50 cryptocurrencies ranked by market cap were posting impressive 24-hour gains in US-dollar value, yet only Nano (NANO) was found to be reporting BTC denominated gains, Messari data revealed.  On Wednesday, though, it seemed investors were rotating funds back into the many other cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin, boosting both USD and BTC denominated values significantly.  !function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"")}})}();
Highlighted above were the top performing cryptocurrencies so far this month as of yesterday’s trading session, according to Messari data. As can be seen bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, once again is being outperformed by others, granted the prices of smaller cryptocurrencies are easier to move since they have smaller market caps and are more thinly traded.  Bitcoin Cash (BCH), a fork of the bitcoin blockchain, is the standout best performer so far this month, at one point flashing 94 percent price growth against the USD, roughly 50 percent of which was recorded on Wednesday alone as its BTC pair surged nearly 40 percent. Litecoin (LTC) has also aggressively extended its impressive Q1 gains into the second quarter of the year. The cryptocurrency’s trade price is now up 43 percent month-to-date, albeit the figure was above 54 percent yesterday, after rising 31 percent in USD value and coming just shy of a $100 price tag on most exchanges.  The price of the “worst” performer in this group on Wednesday was Aion (AION), which aims to act as a bridge connecting different blockchains, still reflected a strong USD denominated increase of 25 percent and a notable 16 percent jump in BTC value.  With the reasons for the recent market surge pointing to technical catalysts, the perhaps unparalleled volatility is creating a day trader’s paradise, although such volatility being back for the long haul is not quite yet a certainty.

0," Bitcoin (BTC) could be in for a minor price pullback as the RSI is showing the most overbought conditions for 16 months. The crypto market leader cruised past the crucial resistance at $4,236 on Tuesday, confirming a longer run bearish-to-bullish trend change and hit a 5.5-month high of $5,345 yesterday, according to Bitstamp data. With the near 30 percent rally to 4.5-month highs seen in the last 48 hours, bitcoin’s 14-day relative strength index – a widely-followed momentum indicator – has jumped above 70.00, indicating overbought conditions. In fact, the RSI is currently seen at 89.11, its highest level since December 2017. An overbought reading on the RSI is often taken to be a sign of impending bearish reversal. In reality, however, an above-70 print merely indicates that the rally is overdone and a reaction – a price pullback – could be in the offing. These overbought indicators become valid only when the price begins to flash early signs of buyer exhaustion, which seems to be the case with BTC. The cryptocurrency witnessed a sharp drop to $4,800 within two hours of hitting highs above $5,300 at 21:00 UTC yesterday and is now struggling to hold onto price points above $5,000. As a result, price consolidation or a deeper pullback to $4,600 could be seen in the next couple of days.  The long upper shadow attached to Wednesday’s candle (above left) indicates the bullish move is running out of steam. Validating that argument is the big bearish engulfing candle seen in the 4-hour chart (lower left), which indicates that the period began with optimism but ended on a pessimistic note. Both candlesticks add credence to the extreme overbought reading on the 14-day RSI (right).  On the hourly chart, the RSI has rolled over from the overbought territory, having charted lower highs over the last 48 hours, contradicting the higher highs on price. That bearish divergence also favors a price pullback to key support levels lined up at $4,672 and $4,565 (200-hour MA). Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

1," After the surprising rally on Tuesday morning, the crypto market extended its gains on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, pushing bitcoin above USD 5,000 for couple of hours, while other top coins also moved higher. (Updates throughout the entire text.) In the past hour (04:40 UTC), the market corrected lower, with top 10 coins by market capitalization dropping by 2%-5%.  Bitcoin trades at USD 4.964 and is up by almost 12% in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin price chart: ____ Top 10 coins by market capitalization. Among smaller capitalization coins, NEM and Dogecoin gained c. 29%, while Augur skyrocketed by 95%. Meanwhile, according to Reuters, a major order, worth about USD 100 million, by an anonymous buyer might be a cause that set off a frenzy of computer-driven trading yesterday. “There has been a single order that has been algorithmically-managed across Coinbase, Kraken and Bitstamp, of around 20,000 BTC,” Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, chief executive of cryptocurrency firm BCB Group, was quoted as saying. Marcus Swanepoel, chief executive of London-based bitcoin company Luno, also commented that ""what we’ve likely seen is that one large investor, probably institutional, bought quite a lot of crypto for their portfolio,” Financial Times reported (FT). However, Arca chief investment officer Jeff Dorman, a former trader for Lehman, Merrill and Citadel, told CNBC that even if buying by trading algorithms kicked off the euphoria, that would have reversed quickly if investors were eager to sell.  “Buyers outweighed sellers, and market makers felt the pressure so they took their markets higher, which triggered stop losses and liquidations, which added more buy pressure,” according to Dorman. George Harrap, chief executive officer at Bitspark, told Bloomberg he's putting ""most things on pause"" until the market settles down. While Dave Chapman, CEO of crypto exchange ANXONE, added that ""events such as today's will probably be seen negatively, or viewed as this market doesn't conform to the trading of traditional instruments."" However, Nigel Green, chief executive of consultancy deVere Group, told FT that this dramatic jump is not only likely to attract many investors who have been sitting on the sidelines, but might reignite institutional interest, also. Meanwhile, according to Dorman, the fact that every small dip has been bought immediately in the last few weeks shows that investors are not scared of sell-offs, they are hoping for them so they can buy more.  ""This certainly raises the near-term floor, but this sentiment can change on a dime too,"" he was quoted as saying by CNBC.

1," The crypto market sprang back to life with bitcoin’s surge to nearly 5-month highs yesterday. But why? To those who have been paying attention to the charts, it shouldn’t come as a surprise. The leading cryptocurrency by market value jumped nearly $1,000 to $5,080 in a 60-minute window early on Tuesday, confirming a transition from bear market to bull market that it had been signaling for some time. In fact, after a year-long bear market, savvy traders were waiting on a trend change that would gain credence if and when prices established the most basic of all bullish technical patterns – a higher low and a higher high on its weekly charts. (A higher high would have been confirmed above $4,236.) Looking back, a big move was overdue, as bitcoin’s average daily trading range had slipped to two-year lows in March. An extended period of low volatility often ends up with a violent move on either side. That low volatility period ended with a strong bullish breakout, possibly due to the following three reasons: As mentioned, bitcoin’s charts have been signaling for some time that a bottom may be in the market. This first began in late February, when we reported that bitcoin’s 50-week moving average dropped below the 100-week moving average, confirming a bearish crossover – the first since April 2015. Long-Term Bitcoin Price Indicator Turns Bearish, Suggesting Bottom May Be In  At the time, we wrote that the lagging indicator had turned bearish for the first time in four years, suggesting bitcoin’s price may have bottomed out after a year of declining prices. We wrote: Put simply, it takes a great effort on the part of the bears to push the 50-week MA below the 100-week MA. As a result, the bear market is usually exhausted by the time the crossover is confirmed, which seems to be the case with BTC. That, however, was just the beginning. Several longer duration indicators, like the weekly money flow index (MFI) and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD), would add evidence to the trend. On March 4, the MFI bottomed, contradicting the lower low in bitcoin’s price. That bullish divergence is widely considered an early warning of a bearish-to-bullish trend reversal, a fact we noted at the time. A rising MFI indicates an increase in buying pressure, while a falling MFI is considered a sign of increasing selling pressures Another Bitcoin Indicator Signals Price Bottom May Be Forming  The same day, the MACD, a momentum oscillator calculated by subtracting the longer-term moving average from the shorter-term moving average, also turned bullish, a fact no doubt noticed by traders. Yet, these technical developments likely reinforced expectations of a stronger rally ahead of the incoming halving, a scheduled, programmatic reduction in the amount of new bitcoin paid to miners. Bitcoin is set to undergo a mining reward halving in May 2020 and historical data indicates the process tends to put a bid under the cryptocurrency at least a year in advance. (The protocol automatically reduces new issuance after a certain number of blocks are processed, an event that occurred most recently in 2016). What is the ‘Halving’? A Primer to Bitcoin’s Big Mining Change  Markets first took note of this possibility in December 2018 after the sell-off ran out of steam near $3,100. The particular price pattern was reminiscent of how the previous bear market had ended at lows near $150 in early January 2015 – 17 months before a reward halving in August 2016. Indeed, historical data shows that bitcoin traders generally respond to the halving, and that the event serves as a signal and potential catalyst.  The narrative that BTC is set to repeat history by breaking into a bull market at least a year ahead of the next mining reward halving (due August 2020) has only strengthened over the last three months, possibly leading to the bull breakout yesterday. Indeed, analysts had been arguing for months that with the next bitcoin halving expected to happen in May 2020, the time had come for investors to start paying attention to this pattern. Bitcoin’s Next Halving Rally: Coming Soon in 2019  One can’t rule out market irregularities, though, and there appear to have been some yesterday. Reuters reported Tuesday that a single algorithmically managed order worth $100 million spread across several major exchanges – Coinbase and Kraken and Bitstamp – triggered the sudden rally to multi-month highs. Meanwhile, Bitfinex data indicates that the unwinding of bearish bets created upward pressure on prices. BTC/USD short positions plunged from 20,654 BTC to 17,103 BTC between 04:00 and 06:00 UTC yesterday; later declining further to 16,978 BTC – the lowest level since March 2018. After falling more than 17% Tuesday, funds in short positions climbed back up 13 percent. Looking forward, BTC could witness a minor pullback to levels below $4,700 in the short-term. The overall outlook, however, will remain bullish as long as BTC remains above $4,236. BTC revisited yesterday’s high of $5,080 earlier today. The bullish move, however, was accompanied by a lower high on the relative strength index (RSI). That bearish divergence indicates scope for a pullback to the ascending (bullish) 50-hour MA, currently at $4,572.  But both the triangle breakout and the bullish higher high above $4,236 indicate the tide has turned in favor of the bulls. Validating that argument are the ascending 5- and 10-week moving averages. That said, with the short duration charts reporting overbought conditions, a break above the crucial 21-month exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $5,200, may not happen in the next few days.

1," It’s a bullish day in the cryptosphere. Paypal makes a blockchain investment and Bitcoin jumps above $5,079 USD. Bitcoin gained 21% in early trade and has now slightly corrected back down to $4,712 according to CoinMarketCap. However, no one knows why the Bitcoin jump happened in the first place. Now, some investors wonder if the rally was the result of some sort of April Fool’s joke. Zhao Changpeng, the chief executive officer of Binance, tweeted earlier today that he was “clueless” about what may have triggered Bitcoin’s jump. Packing on over $600 in one night, the last time Bitcoin hit levels like this was in November. The top cryptocurrency plunged more than 70% in 2018 and has been stagnating through most of 2019 thus far. This period has been dubbed the “crypto winter,” and while today’s rally is impressive, analysts believe that “the bounce is not enough to reset crypto winter.” According to Julien Auchecorne, London-based chief operating officer at XBTO International: “we have no major new products and last year’s big breakthroughs are still in their nascent stage.” For Bitcoin’s jump to sustain itself, then bulls should hope for a bigger fundamental reason for the coin to climb. Elsewhere in the blockchain industry, payment giant PayPal has made its first blockchain investment debut. >> Bitcoin Price Jumps 20% on Technical Breakout: More Coins Follow Announced today, PayPal has joined a Series A funding round for Cambridge Blockchain, a startup that helps financial institutions and other companies manage sensitive data using shared ledgers. The investment amount has not been disclosed but what is known thus far is that Cambridge Blockchain has so far raised a total of $3.5 million in new equity. The firm has several investors who have backed it over the past nine months. So far, the blockchain startup has raised a total capital of $10.5 million. This is the first investment PayPal has put into a blockchain company. The move may help to encourage greater adoption of blockchain technology and its relevant assets.

1," On Tuesday morning, bitcoin price suddenly jumped by 16% in an hour (05:29 UTC), reaching USD 4,882 per coin, or the level last seen in November 2018, before trimming its gains to USD 4,755 (15:27 UTC.) (Updated on 15:51 UTC: updates throughout the entire text. A new section ""Volatility and long-term investing"" has been added, while the ""Looking for catalysts"" section has been updated with its new first paragraph.) Other top coins also registered strong hourly gains of 3.2% - 11.45% and have retracted later. Moreover, bitcoin surpassed its 200 daily moving average, which is considered to be a very important metric in technical analysis.  At the time of writing (15:27 UTC), bitcoin is up by almost 15% in the past 24 hours, increasing its weekly gains to more than 20%.  BTC price chart:
(15:30 UTC) Moreover, bitcoin just posted two-consecutive months of gains, having increased by more than 10% in the first quarter of this year. Also, as reported, the bitcoin bottom has already occurred, as there aren’t additional sellers coming, according to New York-based research and consulting boutique specializing in the digital asset market Delphi Digital. Meanwhile, more signs have recently emerged showing that the altcoin season is also here.

However, Anthony Pompliano, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, a digital asset management firm, stressed that ""short-term volatility doesn’t matter to the long-term investor.""  ""As I have said many times, Bitcoin is a game of accumulation. If an investor has done their own research, understands the risks, believes in the system design, watches the fundamentals, and has a low time preference, they stand a chance to be rewarded handsomely.

George McDonaugh, CEO of KR1, a listed cryptocurrency and blockchain investment company, reiterated that moving away from a specific catalyst or event, lately there's definitely been positive sentiment in the market these last few weeks. ""There's a sense that perhaps we've reached the lows for this cycle and it's onwards and upwards from here on in.

While his followers are also pointing at China, the Middle East and India. ""The economy is slowing down fast in South Korea and Japan, and the stock market is stagnant, so people are prepared to give crypto a second chance,"" according to our correspondent in South Korea Tim Alper. Also, the fact that South Korean and Japanese giants such as Samsung, Hyundai, Kakao, Rakuten, SBI and many Japanese banks are starting to invest a lot of money into their crypto operations, is creating optimism among buyers and investors, he added.

1," Bitcoin’s price emerged above three major moving averages for the first time in nearly 15 months on Tuesday. The development is a byproduct of the cryptocurrency’s surge above $5,000 during Tuesday’s trading session, representing an increase in excess of 20 percent. A moving average (MA), when used in financial analysis, is simply a continuously calculated average of a certain economic factor like price or trading volume over a specified period of time. The moving average is particularly useful for smoothing out short-term fluctuations in the data set to identify the direction of the longer term trend.  Certain moving average durations like the 50, 100 and 200 day MA’s are of more importance when analyzing the price of a traded asset because they tend to display if recent price action is out or under performing its recent or distant trends, which can highlight bullish or bearish market conditions. Perhaps most significant is the 200 day MA, which is commonly regarded as the dividing line between a strong market and weak one. Notably, bitcoin’s price is now trading above these three key moving averages in first since January 13, 2018.   As can be seen in the chart above, bitcoin at the time was priced closer to $15,000 before falling below the 50 day moving average, according to Bitstamp figures. Contrary to what occurred today, this was a bearish signal that pointed to a degree of loss to the strength of the short term trend.  Not long after falling below the 50 day MA, bitcoin’s price found acceptance below the remaining two moving averages, solidifying the newfound bearish trend.  Recently, however, the opposite appears to be the case.  Bitcoin’s price began trading above both the 50 and 100 day moving averages on Feb. 18 of this year, suggesting its trend was beginning to pick up strength. Roughly three weeks later 50 day MA crossed above the 100 day MA, which is an example of a moving average trading strategy called the bullish crossover that is generally considered a buy signal.  Last but not least, bitcoin’s price was able to trade above the 200 day moving average today for the first time since it fell below the MA on March 14, 2018.  Looking back at bitcoin’s historical price data, the 200 day moving average indeed appears to be an important obstacle to gain acceptance above.  As can be seen, bitcoin’s price rose 7,500 percent after finding acceptance above it as well as the 50 and 100 day MAs on October 15, 2015. Notably, its price remained above the 200 day MA for the entire uptrend, until after the market had topped in early 2018.  It’s important to note major moving averages are also touted for offering price support and resistance, so the 200 day MA is likely to be a stubborn technical hurdle until bitcoin’s price can close on a UTC basis above it.

1," After today’s breakout, bitcoin (BTC) now needs to move above crucial resistance near $5,200 to solidify the case for a longer-term bull market. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization crossed the last bearish lower high of $4,236 (Dec. 24 high) at 04:30 UTC Tuesday and jumped to $5,080 – the highest level since Nov. 19 – confirming a transition from a bear to a bull market. The rally to a 4.5-month high was accompanied by a surge in 24-hour trading volumes to above $15 billion – the highest since mid-January 2018, according to CoinMarketCap. The bullish reversal, therefore, looks sustainable. Further, the spike witnessed today has reinforced the positive trend change signaled by both the weekly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and the money flow index a few weeks ago. While the path of least resistance is now to the higher side, the bulls now face taking out the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA), currently lined up at $5,200. The persistent defense of that average support in the five months to October 2018 had triggered hopes of a strong bullish move. More importantly, a convincing break below that technical line on Nov. 14 invited strong selling pressure. So the bulls need to force a convincing break above the 21-month EMA before claiming a complete victory over the bears. As of writing, bitcoin is changing hands at $4,800 on Bitstamp, representing a 15 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. Other major cryptocurrencies like ethereum’s ETH token, XRP and EOS are up at least 5 percent each. Meanwhile, names like litecoin, cardano and monero are flashing double-digit gains. As seen above, BTC’s move above $4,236 has activated twin bullish cues: A bullish higher high and a triangle breakout, both confirming a bearish-to-bullish trend change. The 5- and 10-week moving averages (MAs) are also trending north, indicating a bullish setup, while the relative strength index (RSI) is probing the former support-turned-resistance of 53.70. A break higher would further strengthen the bullish case.  BTC came close to testing the 21-month MA, currently at $5,200, earlier today. A monthly close above that average would solidify the bullish reversal and encourage further buying, possibly leading to a move above $6,000. A break above the 21-month EMA, however, may remain elusive for a few weeks, as the cryptocurrency is looking overbought on shorter duration charts.  On the daily chart, the 14-day RSI is at 86.00 – the highest level since December 2017. The overbought reading would gain credence if the cryptocurrency creates bullish exhaustion patterns (e.g. doji, bearish engulfing, or inverted bearish hammer candles) in the next few days. In that case, prices could fall back to $4,400 (Nov. 29 high) and consolidate for a period. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

1," This past week, bitcoin price started a decent upward move and broke the USD 4,000 and USD 4,070 resistance levels. BTC/USD even traded to a new monthly high above USD 4,120 before starting a downside correction. The price is currently (UTC 08:10 AM) trading above the USD 4,100 level, with key supports near USD 4,100 and USD 4,050. Similarly, ethereum price broke the key USD 140 resistance and revisited the USD 145 resistance. Ripple price rebounded and settled above the USD 0.308 and USD 0.310 resistance levels. XRP must surpass the USD 0.315 resistance level to reclaim the USD 0.320 level in the near term. Total market capitalization  After trading towards the USD 4,150 level, bitcoin price  started a downside correction. BTC/USD traded below the USD 4,100 support, but it found a strong support near USD 4,050. The price climbed higher again and it is currently trading above the USD 4,100 level.
An initial weekly resistance is at USD 4,150, above which the price may test the USD 4,200 resistance level. If there is a fresh decline below the USD 4,100 level, the price could test the USD 4,050 support. The main weekly support area is near the USD 4,000 level. Ethereum price  also followed a similar structure and it surged towards the USD 145 resistance after it broke the USD 142 resistance. Later, ETH/USD corrected lower and it is consolidating above USD 142.
The main weekly resistance is near the USD 145 level, followed by the USD 150 pivot. On the downside, a break below the USD 140 support may push the price towards the key weekly support at USD 135. Bitcoin cash  remained in a bullish zone above the USD 160 support. BCH/USD recently climbed above the USD 165 resistance and it seems like the price could retest the USD 170 resistance level. On the downside, the main supports are USD 165 and 162.
EOS  corrected lower and tested the USD 4.00 support area. The price rebounded recently above the USD 4.10 and USD 4.20 resistance levels. It is currently up more than 2% and it may revisit the USD 4.40 resistance area this week.
Ripple price  recovered after a dip below the USD 0.300 level. XRP/USD is trading above the USD 0.310 support and it seems to be facing a couple of important resistances near the USD 0.312 and USD 0.314 levels. On the downside, the main supports are USD 0.310 and USD 0.306. In the past three sessions, many small cap altcoins climbed higher and gained more than 8%, including TTC, IOST, ABBC, DASH, NANO, DGTX, BAT, NULS, LOOM and WTC. Out of these, TTC rallied close to 17% and IOST is up around 16%. Overall, bitcoin price is trading in a positive zone above the USD 4,100 and USD 4,060 support levels. On the upside, there are high chances of a fresh high above the USD 4,150 and USD 4,200 resistance levels in the coming days.

1," The first quarter of 2019 was a breath of fresh air for the cryptocurrency market, having recorded its first quarterly increase in overall network valuations since the fourth quarter of 2017. Interestingly, however, bitcoin is among the least significant price gainers so far this year while still flashing a noteworthy Q1 increase of 10 percent. What this means is that a sizable portion of the market’s recent growth came from the many other cryptocurrencies trading on exchanges today.  In fact, data from analytics provider Messari reveals that 118 cryptos increased more in price on a year-to-date basis than bitcoin, with several boasting triple-digit percent increases during that period.  As a result, the total network value of all cryptocurrencies – excluding bitcoin – came within 1 percent of suprassing that of bitcoin’s in March. With Q1 of 2019 now in the history books, let’s dive into some of the more notable individual performances by way of breaking down their respective asset size classes and market sectors.  There is a wide spectrum of assets, in the cryptocurrency market. These range from some of the biggest, like ethereum (close to $15 billion), to the smallest, like dancoin (DAN), which is worth just over $3 million. Hundreds of networks fall in between.  The table below depicts how Messari segments crypto-asset sizes into the four groups (large cap, medium cap, small cap and micro cap), as well their respective best and worst performers for the Q1 period. !function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"")}})}(); While the highest-ranked cryptocurrencies in terms of asset size tend to be the most well-known coins in the industry (they trade with the most volume), data shows they are not always the strongest performers. As can be seen, the top performers in both the medium and small-cap segments saw significantly better Q1 performances than the leader of the large-cap segment, binance coin (BNB), the price of which nearly tripled during that period.   Ravencoin’s (RVN) performance surpassed all other medium cap cryptos, boasting a 386 percent increase in Q1, almost all of which was achieved in the month of March when its price jumped from the monthly open of $0.013 to its close of $0.061, according to data from Binance.  Pchain (PAI) was the best performer in the small-cap segment as well as the single strongest performer in the entire cryptocurrency market. PAI recorded a Q1 price increase of roughly 781 percent, Messari data reveals.  While many cryptocurrencies boasted double and even triple-digit gains in Q1, not all outperformed bitcoin or even finished the quarter with gains. Bitcoin SV’s (BSV) 26 percent loss and NEM’s (XEM) 13 percent loss was enough to establish them as the worst performers in the large and medium cap segments, respectively, while the worst performer of the broader market was the small-cap crypto Grin (GRIN), which lost 70 percent of its value since its main-net launch on January 15. It should be noted that market cap as a metric for valuing crypto-assets does have limitations not observed when used in traditional finance for valuing a publicly traded company. For example, lost bitcoins are technically accounted for in bitcoin’s market capitalization, even though they are no longer part of the “circulating” supply and can never be spent. This is not an issue when determining the market cap of a company since only outstanding and liquid shares are taken into account, leading cryptocurrency researchers to come up with alternative network valuation models like  “realized cap“, first proposed by Coinmetrics in 2018, that aims to account for such limitations. Another way to segment the cryptocurrency market is by sector, which describes the key parts of the crypto-economy.  Messari provides a number of different market sector classifications, the Q1 average and median performance of which are shown in the table below, and were calculated by taking the performance of the top 5 coins by market cap in each sector into account. !function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"")}})}(); As can be seen, the “Miscellaneous” sector was the best performing sector in Q1 on average, but this was largely due to the fact the best and near 800 percent quarterly gainer Pchain (PAI) is included in the category. Since PAI’s growth significantly skews the average performance of the sector, the median which describes the true middle value of a given sector’s quarterly performances, perhaps most honestly describes the sector with a more modest 52 percent median price increase. The strongest sector in terms of median performance in Q1 were the coins intended to act as bridges between cryptocurrencies, making those networks interoperable. That list is comprised of names like Ontology (ONT), Chainlink (LINK) and Aion (AION). The sector finished Q1 with a 78 percent increase as the median performance. In all, the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap in each sector averaged no worse than a 20 percent price increase. It’s one accomplishment to have a strong quarter. It’s another feat entirely for an asset to trade above its 200-day moving average.  Generally regarded to as the dividing line between a strong market and one that is not, the 200-day moving average is a technical hurdle that several top-ranked cryptocurrencies were able to climb above for the first time this quarter in nearly a year.  !function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"")}})}(); The last time CoinDesk conducted the same analysis on March 13, just four of the top 20 cryptocurrencies had both of its BTC and USD pairs trading above the 200 day moving average as signs of life in the market were just beginning to re-emerge.   Since then, however, four more cryptocurrencies joined the list, including Ontology (ONT), Tezos (XTZ), Cardano (ADA), and EOS (EOS) all of which now are trading with both pairs above the moving average. This indicates that a shift from bearish to bullish trends is on the rise.  Still lagging behind with neither trading pair above the MA are the first and third largest cryptocurrencies in the world by market cap, bitcoin (BTC) and XRP (XRP), as well as six others (not including USDT and Bitcoin SV, the latter of which has less than 200 days of trading history). Indeed, Q1 was an impressive stretch for the cryptocurrency market, which has seemingly renewed optimism among some of its market participants.  On March 22, CoinDesk Markets conducted a Twitter poll to gauge the public’s longer term outlook on the market leader bitcoin by asking what price it will trade closest to on the date of its next supply production halving event in May of 2020. On the day of #bitcoin's next halving, what will its price be closest to? The next halving is anticipated to occur in May of 2020. — CoinDesk Markets (@CoinDeskMarkets) March 22, 2019  Interestingly, the most popular option was a value closest to $15,000, accumulating 47 percent of the 6,450 votes.  Currently priced around $4,000, that would mean the majority of those polled believe bitcoin will increase at least 275 percent or nearly quadruple its value in less than 14 months.

1," Bitcoin made double-digit gains in the first three months of 2019, marking its best quarterly performance since Q4 2017. The crypto market leader closed (UTC) yesterday at $4,096, representing a 10.91 percent gain on January’s opening price of $3,693, according to Bitstamp data. That is the first double-digit quarterly gain since the final three months of 2017 when prices had rallied a staggering 220.84 percent. Back then, the bull market was raging on hopes that listing of bitcoin futures on major US exchanges would open the doors to the yield-hungry institutional investors. That, however, did not materialize and prices fell by 73.39 percent in 2018. !function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"")}})}();  As can be seen, the latest double-digit quarterly gain has come after a prolonged bear market but looks more than the usual corrective bounce with prices mimicking the bottoming pattern seen before the 2015 bull breakout. Further, a closer look at the monthly price action indicates the cryptocurrency is likely making a slow transition from a bearish to a bullish market. January: Seller exhaustion Bitcoin fell 7.59 percent in January, but the monthly high and low fell within the trading range of the previous month. Essentially, BTC created “an inside month” candle, a sign of bearish exhaustion. February and March: Higher lows BTC established a bullish higher low near $3,300 on the weekly chart in the first week of February and jumped to a high of $4,190 on Feb. 24. The rise above $4,000, however, was short-lived and prices fell back to 3,600 at the end of February. BTC had charted its way back to $4,100 by the end of March with multiple bullish higher lows along the 30-day moving average. The bearish exhaustion followed by a steady stream of higher lows has raised hopes of BTC confirming a bull breakout with a move above $4,236 (Dec. 24 high). However, if history is any guide, then a sustained break above $4,236 may not happen for a few more months. It is worth noting that the bullish breakout seen in October 2015 was preceded by a nine-month period of consolidation. In the short-term, the path of least resistance appears to be on the higher side. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $4,122 on Bistamp – up 0.82 percent on a 24-hour basis.  As seen on the weekly chart (above left), BTC created a bullish engulfing candle last week, reinforcing the bullish view put forward by the ascending 5- and 10-week moving averages (MAs). On the daily chart (above right), BTC created a bullish higher low along the 30-day MA on March 25 and closed well above $4,055 on Friday. That strengthened the bullish case put forward by the upward sloping 5- and 10-day MAs, the bullish crossover of the 50- and 100-day MAs and the long-tailed doji created on Feb. 27. As a result, BTC look set to test the Feb. 24 high of $4,190. Even so, there is merit in being cautious, as the cryptocurrency created a doji candle on Saturday – a sign of bullish exhaustion – and so far, the cryptocurrency has struggled to find acceptance above $4,130 (doji candle high). A persistent failure to convincingly scale $4,130 would weaken the bullish case and could yield a pullback to the 30-day MA, currently at $3,938.

1," In the past few sessions, there were mostly bullish moves in bitcoin price above the USD 4,000. BTC/USD traded above the USD 4,025 and USD 4,040 resistance levels. A fresh weekly high was formed, but the price failed to surpass the USD 4,060 - USD 4,070 resistance area. The current (UTC 08:00 AM) price action is positive and it seems like bulls could aim a break above the USD 4,060 - USD 4,070 resistance area. Similarly, ethereum is moving higher and it may attempt to clear the USD 140 resistance. Besides, ripple price is gaining bullish momentum above USD 0.307 and it may soon test the USD 0.310 or 0.312 resistance levels. Total market capitalization  After a minor downside correction, bitcoin price  found support near the USD 4,000 level. BCT/USD climbed higher once again and broke the USD 4,025 and USD 4,040 resistance levels. It even traded to a new weekly high above USD 4,050, but sellers protected the USD 4,060 - USD 4,070 resistance area.
The price is currently consolidating gains and if there is a downside correction, the USD 4,025 and USD 4,000 levels are likely to act as supports. On the upside, a convincing break above the USD 4,060 - USD 4,070 resistance area may perhaps clear the path for more upsides towards USD 4,100 and USD 4,150. Ethereum price  corrected lower and tested the key USD 136 support area. ETH/USD bounced back above the USD 138 resistance and it is currently moving higher.  
The price may perhaps test the USD 140 resistance in the near term. If buyers remain in control and clear the USD 140 resistance, ether buyers could aim the USD 145 and USD 148 resistance levels. Bitcoin cash price  resumed its upward move and traded above the USD 168 resistance. BCH/USD is currently up more than 1% and it seems like the price might accelerate above the USD 170 and USD 172 resistance levels in the near term. On the downside, the main support for buyers is near USD 165.
EOS  corrected a few points after a strong rally towards the USD 4.35 level. The price is currently trading near the USD 4.20 level, with the next key support near the USD 4.15 level. On the upside, there are hurdles near USD 4.30 and USD 4.35.
Ripple price  found support near the USD 0.305 level and later started a fresh upward move. XRP/USD traded above the USD 0.306 and USD 0.307 levels, with a bullish bias. On the upside, there is a strong resistance waiting near USD 0.310.  In the past two sessions, a few small cap altcoins climbed higher between 5%-12%, including KCS, BAT, AOA, XTZ, MXM, IOST, XEM and ELA. Out of these, KCS is up more than 12% and BAT is up close to 11%. Overall, bitcoin price is trading in a bullish zone above the USD 4,000 support level. If BTC/USD surpassed the USD 4,070 swing high, there could be solid gains in the coming sessions. In the mentioned case, altcoins such as ETH, XRP, BCH, WAN, ICX, EOS, ADA and TRX might also gain traction.

1," Bitcoin is slowly gaining altitude with a long-term lagging indicator flashing signs similar to those seen before the 2015 bull breakout. The crypto market leader rose to $4,100 at 10:30 UTC on Bitstamp today – the highest level since Feb. 24 – validating a bullish higher low established along the crucial 30-day moving average (MA) support earlier this week. Prices, therefore, could rise further toward the February high of $4,190 in the next few days. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $4,075, representing 0.5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. While BTC’s short-term prospects seem to have improved with the move, a longer term bullish reversal above $4,236 still remains elusive. A convincing break above that level, however, could happen in the next few months, according to historical data related to bitcoin’s three-day chart 200-candle moving average (MA). That average is based on two-year-old data and tends to lag price by more than a year. For instance, bitcoin’s price topped out at $20,000 in December 2017 and has been charting lower highs ever since. The 200-candle MA, however, continued to trend north indicating a bullish setup throughout 2018 and shed the bullish bias (turned flat) this month – three months after price sell-off ran out of steam near $3,100. A similar action was seen in months leading up to the long-term bullish reversal of October 2015, as seen in the chart below.  As seen above right, the 200-candle MA continued sloping upwards through the December 2013 to January 2015 bear market and turned flat in March/April 2015 – three months after the end of the sell-off at $152. The cryptocurrency traded largely in the range of $200-$300 in the next six months before breaking into a bull run in October 2015. It is worth noting that the average had begun trending south three months before the bull breakout. If history is any guide, then BTC may spend the next few months in the recent trading range of $3,100–$4,300 and could pick up a strong bid once the key average starts trending lower.  Bitcoin’s break above the March 21 high of $4,055 is accompanied by a bull flag breakout, a bullish continuation pattern, on the 4-hour chart (above right). Further, the 14-day relative strength index is reporting bullish conditions with an above 50.00 reading (see daily chart, left). As a result, the February high of $4,190 could soon come into play. A longer-term bullish reversal would be confirmed if prices close above that level on Sunday. The short-term bullish case, however, would weaken if prices fail to close above $4,055 today.

0," The Bitcoin bottom has either already occurred or it’s happening now, at the end of Q1, as there aren’t additional sellers coming, according to New York-based research and consulting boutique specializing in the digital asset market Delphi Digital, who forecasted this scenario back in December. “It’s clear that there’s an increasingly smaller amount of coins that are being actively traded and sold, implying the incremental demand necessary for price to bottom also decreases,” the company wrote in a mid-March update to their clients, adding that there is the growing shift in overall bitcoin ownership mentality as individuals are set to hold bitcoin for the long term.  Yan Liberman, Co-Founder and Principal at Delphi Digital, confirmed to Cryptonews.com that this still remains the case at the end of March.  The paper sees strong hands in long term holders*, which have not sold in the past three months and are not expected to start doing so in the coming period. “Over that same time period [end of November to the end of January], we’ve noticed a decrease in 3-5 year holders from 9% to 8%, where it’s held flat. Aside from this slight decline, there hasn’t been much selling from long-term holders as BTC price remained in a consolidation period for much of the last three months,” the report said adding that the proportion of 2-3 year holders remains flat and low, implying theses individuals have mostly sold or are likely to continue to hold. The researchers estimate that even under conservative assumptions for lost coins, there isn't much potential selling that can come from long-term holders.  However, what could prompt 1-3 year holders to sell their coins in the coming months? According to Liberman, assuming Bitcoin doesn't get successfully attacked, it's likely that those individuals don't sell in the coming months unless: He goes on to explain that the first and second option are highly unlikely, while the third is difficult to predict, “because everyone has different breakeven prices.” “The 1-2 year holder group implies that you purchased between March 27th, 2017 and March 27, 2018. We actually have more granular data, and the mix of 12-18 month holders is larger than the 18-24 months. This implies that more of the 1-2 year holders purchased at a higher price point, thus their break-even is higher, and they're less likely to sell for a small price increase,” the Co-founder said.  Meanwhile, 2-3 year holders make up a very small amount of overall bitcoin ownership.  “They've all purchased this BTC at a significant discount to current prices, so if they haven't sold already, it's difficult to see what triggers them to sell in the next coming months,” Liberman concluded. The company estimates to extract more information from the 2-3 year holder band in June as the 1-2 year owners begin to shift over to become 2-3 year holders. $BTC UTXO age distribution animatedDec 2017 - March 2019data @unchainedcap pic.twitter.com/FQ2aeTV7gY Another thing that has the community worried about how the prices will behave is the halvening, set to happen in 2020, when the Bitcoin block mining reward will decrease from 12.5 to 6.25 bitcoins. As Cryptonews.com previously reported, the research team believes that this will be the last reward halving to have a very significant impact on price.  “The upcoming halvening in May 2020 also functions as an intermediate catalyst for a reduction in selling pressure. For reference, prices bottomed 542 days before the halvening in 2016. As of March 15th, we’re ~435 days away from the next expected halvening,” they added earlier this month. Also, in its mid-March report, Delphi Digital said that institutional capital wading into this market will eventually suppress crypto asset volatility, boosting bitcoin’s appeal as investors flock to safety, but they see this as a longer-term trend unlikely to materialize in the foreseeable future. They’re also discussing Bitcoin’s shifting narrative from a peer-to-peer currency to digital gold. Meanwhile, adoption of the Lightning Network will help enable those who prefer to use the digital currency as a peer to peer currency, Liberman said adding that he doesn’t believe that it'll change the general narrative. “It’s functional for different people in different ways. Those that can afford to treat it as a long term SoV [Store of Value] type of investment (developing nations) are doing that. At the same time, those individuals that don’t have the ability to save are also able to use it as a potential way to mitigate foreign currency risk (temporarily), a payments processor in areas that are unbanked or censored by the nation state, and as a method of transferring wealth when attempting to relocate,” the Co-founder said.
_______ * - Delphi Digital analyses UTXO (unspent transaction output) trends. UTXO stands for the unspent output from bitcoin transactions. Every transaction creates a new UTXO, and the age of the UTXO indicates the block that it was first included in. In other words, the UTXO age indicates the last time bitcoin was moved. Analyzing Bitcoin's aggregate UTXO age distribution over time provides insight into the buying and selling patterns of previous market cycles. This allows the company to forecast where we are in relation to prior cycles and what we can likely expect going forward."
0," Yesterday, there were solid bullish moves in bitcoin price above the USD 3,950 and USD 4,000 resistance levels. BTC/USD recently tested the USD 4,050 resistance and corrected lower. The price is currently (UTC 08:10 AM) consolidating in a range and dips remain supported near the USD 4,000 and USD 3,980. Similarly, ethereum price extended gains and tested the key USD 140 resistance. Later, ETH/USD corrected lower and it is currently trading near the USD 138 support. Ripple price traded close to the USD 0.310 resistance, where sellers emerged and later the price corrected lower below USD 0.308 and USD 0.306. Total market capitalization  There was an upside extension in bitcoin price  above the USD 4,000 resistance. BTC/USD traded above the USD 4,020 level and tested the USD 4,050 resistance level. However, buyers failed to gain strength above USD 4,040 and the price later corrected lower. 
An immediate support is at USD 4,000, below which the price may perhaps test the USD 3,980 support. The main buy area is near the USD 3,950 level. On the upside, a strong follow through above USD 4,040 and USD 4,050 is must for buyers to gain traction. Ethereum price  tested the all-important USD 140 resistance level before sellers emerged. ETH/USD corrected lower and recently tested the USD 138 support level. At the outset, it seems like the price is struggling to stay above USD 138 and it could correct towards USD 136.
On the upside, the USD 139 and USD 140 levels are important resistances. A successful close above USD 140 may push the price towards the USD 144 level. Bitcoin cash price  extended its rally above the USD 168 and USD 170 levels. BCH/USD traded close to the USD 174 level and recently corrected below the USD 170 support. The next key support is near the USD 165 level, where buyers might appear.
EOS  surged above the USD 4.00 and USD 4.20 resistance levels. The price even broke the USD 4.30 resistance and traded close to USD 4.35. It is currently correcting lower towards the USD 4.20 and USD 4.15 support levels.
Ripple price  climbed higher towards the USD 0.309 and USD 0.310 resistance levels, where buyers struggled. As a result, there was a downside correction and the price declined below the USD 0.306 support. It is currently testing USD 0.305 and the next support is at USD 0.304. Despite corrective moves in bitcoin and ethereum, a few small cap altcoins gained more than 8%, including MANA, RVN, XTZ, FCT, NULS, AION and BAT. Out of these, MANA climbed more than 36% and RVN is up close to 28%. The current price action suggests a downside correction in bitcoin price below the USD 4,000 support level. However, declines are likely to find a strong buying interest and BTC/USD might bounce back from the USD 3,980 or USD 3,950 support in the coming sessions.

0," Bitcoin now has a high price target if it is to see a bullish reversal this month, price charts suggest. The leading cryptocurrency jumped more than 10 percent in February, snapping the record six-month losing streak. More importantly, the recovery rally seen in February engulfed the price action seen in the preceding month. Essentially, BTC created a bullish engulfing candle on the monthly chart following an 80 percent drop from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017. While that pattern is widely considered an early warning of potential bullish reversal, traders usually wait for more credible signs of a trend change, preferably a close above the candle’s high. Put simply, a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change would be confirmed if prices close (UTC) above the February high of $4,190 on March 31. That would also reinforce the bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by several longer duration indicators over the last few weeks. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at around $4,000 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.4 percent rise on a 24-hour basis.  BTC clocked a high of $4,190 and created a bullish engulfing candle last month – likely a sign of bargain hunting following a prolonged sell-off. So far, the follow-through has been positive, confirming the bear exhaustion. A UTC close above $4,190 on March 31 would confirm a longer-term bullish reversal and open the doors to the psychological hurdle of $5,000. A failure to close above that key level would weaken the bullish case and could increase selling pressure.  On the daily chart, BTC bounced up from the 30-day moving average (MA) earlier this week, invalidating Monday’s bearish close below $3,920. However, the case for a monthly close above$4,190 would strengthen if prices establish a higher high above the March 21 high of $4,055 in the next 48 hours. That would also confirm a bull flag breakout on the 4-hour chart – a continuation pattern which often accelerates the preceding bullish move. On the downside, the 30-day MA, currently at $3,900, is the level to beat for the bears. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

0," Believe it or not, there are more ways to anticipate the future market value of bitcoin than through practicing technical analysis or by observing network activity developments.  While valuable in their own right, thanks to researchers Willy Woo and David Puell, several new experimental bitcoin valuation metrics were released in February that combine the two fields to create a more holistic view of bitcoin’s market.   Sample sizes are small in the cryptocurrency markets, with the oldest, bitcoin, having existed just 10 years, but two of the newly released metrics termed “Top Cap” and Delta Cap” have shown to be effective at identifying the tops and bottoms of bitcoin’s wild market cycles thus far.  Proposed by Puell, the metric that successfully caught both bear market bottoms in 2011 and 2015, and that is known as the Delta Cap, is calculated as follows: Delta cap = Realized cap – Average cap Average cap =  “cumulative sum of daily market cap values / age of the market in days.” Realized cap = “UTXOs are aggregated and assigned a price based on the BTCUSD market price at the time when said UTXOs last moved”  Resembling a long-term moving average that is touted for offering price support and resistance, the delta cap has shown to have the same effect by providing price support at roughly $2.50, the bottom in 2011, and $176, the bottom in 2015.  As can be seen above, delta cap is making a case for bitcoin having bottomed out once again, a point made evident by the fact that its price bounced off of the metric during its drop to $3,200 at the end of 2018, Indeed, delta cap may be pointing to bitcoin’s market leaving its bearish trend, but there could be more nuance to the situation than first meets the eye. Bitcoin has only ever bottomed out and escaped one of its infamous bear markets after the delta cap and average caps have collided with eachother, or came very close to it, as can be seen in both 2011 and 2015. At the time of writing, delta cap is about $1,600 higher than the average cap, theoretically suggesting bitcoin’s price will either have to wait for the average cap to rise and meet the delta cap, or the delta cap will need to fall to meet the average cap by way of more significant market depreciation before a true bottom can form. Proposed by Woo in collaboration with Puell, top cap aims to achieve the opposite of the delta cap, in that is has been experimentally configured to pinpoint the tops of bitcoin’s explosive bull markets.  Top cap = Average cap * 35 According to Woobull.com, the multiple of 35 was found to pinpoint bitcoin historical tops. As can be seen, the metric also resembles a moving average and effectively provided resistance at $35 in 2011, $237 in 2013 and once again at around $1,000 in the same year, all of which were precise market tops followed by significant, albeit temporary depreciation.  Most recently, bitcoin’s price came in contact with the top cap when its market reached peak euphoria and an all-time high near $20,000 in 2018. At the time of writing, bitcoin’s price is still roughly 80 percent below the all-time high.  When both delta and top cap are plotted on the same chart, a “valuation Bollinger band” is created as Woo puts it, where the two metrics create the anticipated boundaries of bitcoin’s market movement.  Currently located at $48,724, the top cap paints a rosy picture for the future of bitcoin if it indeed endures another boisterous bull market, although the creator Woo thinks $90,000 is a better estimate “at a minimum on the early trajectory” for bitcoin’s next significant market top.  Disclosure: The author holds several cryptocurrencies, please see Sam’s author profile here for more information.  Math image via Shutterstock; Charts from Woobull.com"
1," Recently, we saw a downside reaction in bitcoin below the USD 3,950 support level. BTC tested the USD 3,900 support level on a couple of occasions, but sellers failed to retain control. Finally, bulls had the upper hand and the price reversed above the USD 3,950 and USD 3,980 resistance levels. Similarly, there was a sharp bullish reaction in ethereum price from the USD 130 support. ETH rallied above USD 135 and it is currently (UTC 08:00 AM) trading above USD 137. Ripple price too recovered and climbed back above the USD 0.300 and USD 0.305 resistance levels, with bullish moves.  Total market capitalization  Yesterday, there was another test of the USD 3,900 support by bitcoin price . There were a couple of spikes near the USD 3,900 before sellers gave up. Finally, there was a strong bullish reaction and the price climbed above the USD 3,950 and USD 3,980 resistance levels.
The price is now trading near the USD 4,000 resistance. If there is follow through above USD 4,000 and 4,015, the price is likely to accelerate towards the USD 4,070 swing high. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,980, but the main support is near the USD 3,950 level. Ethereum price  tested the USD 130 support area, where a strong buying interest emerged. As a result, ETH started a solid upward move and traded above the USD 132 and USD 135 resistance levels.
The price even broke the USD 137 level and it is currently consolidating below the USD 138 resistance. The next key resistance is near the USD 140 level. On the downside, the USD 135 level may once again act as a support. Bitcoin cash price  jumped by more than 5% and broke the USD 160 and USD 164 resistance levels. BCH/USD is currently trading near the USD 166 level and it may continue to rise towards the USD 170 resistance.
EOS  performed really well and climbed above the USD 3.85 resistance level. The price is up more than 10% and it recently cleared the USD 4.00 resistance. A high was formed near USD 4.10 level and the price is currently consolidating gains.
Ripple price  tested the USD 0.295 support level before starting a fresh rebound. XRP/USD traded above the USD 0.300 and USD 0.305 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. The next major hurdle for buyers is near the USD 0.308 level. In the past three sessions, many small cap altcoins recovered and jumped more than 10%, including ENG, WICC, WTC, ADA, WAN, PIVX and XZC. Out of these, ENG climbed more than 50% and WICC is up close to 13%. Overall, bitcoin price jumped back in a positive zone, with a close above the USD 3,950 and USD 3,970. However, the USD 4,000 resistance is still intact. Therefore, a clear break above the USD 4,000 level is must for BTC buyers to retain action and push the price further higher.

1," Bitcoin (BTC) has once more rebounded from the 30-day moving average, thwarting a bearish move that saw prices drop below $3,920 on Monday. The move sees the crypto market leader return from uncertain ground 24 hours ago, having dived out of the $3,920-$4,055 trading range on Monday. That range breakdown coupled with the signs of bullish exhaustion on the longer duration charts had opened the doors for a deeper drop below the 30-day moving average (MA) at $3,883, as discussed yesterday. The MA support, however, held ground despite the bearish setup, allowing BTC to climb back to $4,000. Essentially, the cryptocurrency has established a bullish higher low along the key average for the third time this month. While the bearish case has weakened, the short-term bullish view put forward by the long-tailed doji created on Feb. 27 would only be revived if there is a strong follow through to the rebound from the 30-day MA support, preferably a break above the recent high of $4,055 hit on March 21. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $4,015 on Bitstamp, representing a 2.6 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. A high of $4,031 was clocked soon before press time.  As seen above, BTC has picked up a bid following the defense of the 30-day MA, currently at $3,889. The higher-low pattern would gain credence if the bounce ends up establishing a higher high above the March 21 high of $4,055. That would expose the February high of $4,190, above which a major hurdle is seen at $4,236 – the bearish lower high created on Dec. 24. On the downside, a UTC close below the 30-day MA is the target for the bears.  On the 8-hour chart, BTC has breached the falling channel on the higher side and the breakout is backed by a bullish relative strength index (RSI) reading of 61.00. So, prices may find acceptance above $4,040 in the next few hours. The bullish case, however, would weaken if the rising trendline hurdle proves a tough nut to crack.

1," After a strong rejection near the USD 4,000 resistance, bitcoin price started a sharp decline. BTC declined below the USD 3,980 and USD 3,950 support levels. It moved into a bearish zone and tested the USD 3,900 support level. Similarly, there were bearish moves in ethereum below the USD 136 and USD 135 support levels. ETH tested the USD 132 support and it is currently (UTC 08:10 AM) correcting higher. Ripple price is trading with a bearish bias near USD 0.300 and it may continue to decline in the near term.  Total market capitalization  There was a strong downward move in bitcoin price  from the USD 4,000 resistance. BTC declined below the USD 3,950 support level and it even spiked below the USD 3,900 level. It is correcting higher towards the USD 3,950 level, which was a support earlier and now it could act as a resistance.
If buyers push the price above USD 3,950, the price may revisit the USD 4,000 resistance. If not, there is a risk of a fresh decline towards USD 3,900 or USD 3,860 in the coming sessions. Ethereum price  also faced an increase in selling pressure after it failed to surpass the USD 138 resistance. ETH/USD declined below the USD 135 support level and tested the next key support at USD 132.
The price is currently correcting higher above USD 133, but it is likely to face sellers near the USD 134 or 135 levels. On the downside, a break below the USD 132 support may push the price towards USD 130. Bitcoin cash price  trimmed most of its recent gains and broke the USD 160 support level. BCH/USD is currently trading near USD 158 and it may continue to move down towards the USD 155 support level.
EOS  was comparatively stable above the USD 3.62 support. However, there are many hurdles on the upside near the USD 3.65 and USD 3.70 levels. On the downside, the main support is near the USD 3.60 level.
Ripple price  declined below the USD 0.306 and USD 0.304 support levels. XRP/USD is trading near the USD 0.300 support and it may continue to decline towards the USD 0.295 and USD 0.292 support levels in the near term. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 0.302, followed by USD 0.304. In the past three sessions, many small cap altcoins declined more than 8%, including DGB, AOA, POLY, ABBC, ONT, QBIT, STEEM, PAI, ICX and QASH. Out of these, DGB is down around 15% and AOA fell close to 13%. Overall, bitcoin price failed to gain bullish momentum above the USD 4,000 resistance and declined sharply. Going forward, the USD 3,900 support might play a crucial role for the next move. If BTC settles below USD 3,900, there could be additional losses in the coming days.

1," Bitcoin (BTC) is on the defensive after briefly falling below $3,900 at around 07:00 UTC this morning. The cryptocurrency fell to a 10-day low of $3,850 on Monday, confirming a downside break of the recent trading range of $3,920–$4,055. Further, BTC closed (UTC) yesterday below $3,920, reinforcing the bearish outside reversal candle created on March 21. The repeated failure to scale $4,000 in a convincing manner followed by the drop below $3,920 validates the bearish view put forward by the historically strong resistance of the downward sloping 21-week moving average (MA). As a result, the cryptocurrency risks falling below the 30-day MA, currently flatlined at $3,883, in the short-term. Notably, that average has put brakes on the sell-off at least three times in the last three weeks. Hence, a break below $3,883 could further strengthen the bear grip around the cryptocurrency. The bearish case, however, would weaken if the price bounces up strongly from the 30-day line. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,906 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.73 percent drop on a 24-hour basis. As seen on the 4-hour chart, BTC has found acceptance below the 100-candle MA support, having dived out of the sideways channel yesterday. While the 200-candle MA has held ground in the last 12 hours, its repeated defense has failed to produce a stronger bounce – a sign that bullish sentiment has waned. Validating that argument is the fact that the major averages (50, 100 and 200) have shed bullish bias (are flatlined). On the daily chart, BTC has breached the ascending trendline and the 5- and 10-candle MAs have produced a bearish crossover, validating yesterday’s bearish close below $3,920. Hence, both the 200-candle MA on the 4-hour chart and the 30-day MA, currently at $3,888 and $3,883, respectively, could take up the role of resistance in the next 24 hours.  The previous three-day candle closed below $3,920 – the low of the preceding doji candle – confirming a bearish reversal. As a result, the path of least resistance appears to be on the downside.

0," Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of popular cryptocurrency trading platform BitMEX, has recently predicted that Bitcoin will more than double and reach USD 10,000 per coin this year. This is far from the first prediction he has made: from reminding people during the bull market in December 2017 that Bitcoin is still extremely volatile, over calling a USD 50,000 forecast in case of a positive regulatory ETF during 2018, to calling a bottom at USD 2,000. Now, his latest prediction is again bullish.  “Green shoots will begin to appear in early Q4. Free money and collective amnesia are powerful drugs. Also after two years of wage cucking, punters should have a few sheckles [sic] to rub together,” said the CEO in a newsletter last Friday, adding, “The 2019 chop will be intense, but the markets will claw back to USD 10,000. That is a very significant psychological barrier. It’s a nice round sexy number."" According to Hayes, USD 20,000 is the ultimate recovery.  ""However, it took 11 months from USD 1,000 to USD 10,000, but less than one month from USD 10,000 to USD 20,000 back to USD 10,000. Melissa Lee [a reporter and news anchor for CNBC] peep this. USD 10,000 is my number, and I’m stickin’ to it,” he said. Following the prediction by Hayes, a Twitter poll showed that 59% of around 1,000 respondents see Bitcoin reaching USD 10,000 by the end of the year. Lets first get to $6000 range and see what happens 😋 Meanwhile, back when the cryptoverse was booming and Bitcoin was reaching its heights in December 2017, Hayes warned in an interview with Forbes: “People have been lulled into complacency with a market that keeps going up every day. They don’t understand that this is an extremely volatile asset. It’s not constrained by national borders and there are people out to do whatever they can to make money, including nefarious things against exchanges.”  Sure enough, the price dropped in the coming days and never recovered to those heights again.  His next famous prediction came in June 2018 in an interview with news outlet CNBC, when he said that a positive regulatory response to Bitcoin could send it soaring to USD 50,000 by the end of that year. Unfortunately, the positive response did not happen, and so neither did his prediction come to pass.  However, his idea of a bottom looks more accurate: “I think that something that goes up to USD 20,000 in one year can have a correction down to USD 6,000 and will definitely find a bottom at about USD 3,000 and USD 5,000 range.”  When it was obvious that there was no time for a regulatory response to send Bitcoin up before the end of 2018, Hayes suggested that Bitcoin could bottom out at USD 2,000 before reversing course back in November 2018.

0," Bitcoin’s average daily trading range so far in March is its lowest in nearly two years when, at the time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency was worth roughly a quarter of what it is now.  At the time of writing, bitcoin’s average 24-hour trading range so far this month, defined as the average difference between the high and low price of each day in a given month, has been just $85, its lowest average range since the same metric recorded $32 in April of 2017, according to CoinDesk data. Notably, the average trading range (also known as the average daily volatility) segmented by month has fallen much faster than bitcoin’s market prices as can be seen below.  Indeed, bitcoin is currently trading across exchanges at an average price of $3,943, comparable to levels seen in September 2017, while volatility has returned to levels observed when bitcoin’s price was roughly $1,000. Yet, periods of low volatility tend to precede a big move in either direction in a market, as was the case in 2017. In fact, April of 2017 was the first month to close sufficiently above the top of its previous bull run in 2013 and was followed by a multi-year bear market. After April closed with an average daily trading range of $32, the price of bitcoin went on to surge 65 percent the following month with an average daily trading range of $153 – nearly four times higher than that seen the month prior. Just as bitcoin’s price was indecisive in April as it approached the key technical hurdle of a previous all-time high, bitcoin is now approaching another major technical hurdle in the form of long term downtrend resistance.  As shown above, bitcoin’s current price is just below a crucial downtrend line, which if broken could be a sign its market has shifted from bearish to bullish or at-least bearish to neutral, just as it did in 2015 when prices surpassed a near identical downtrend line.

0," Chart signals of bullish exhaustion suggest bitcoin’s (BTC) narrowing trading range could soon be breached to the downside. The leading cryptocurrency by market value is sidelined below $4,000 for the fourth straight day, and has been restricted to the narrow range of $3,920–$4,055 since March 17, according to Bitstamp data. More importantly, prices clocked a high and low of $4,055 and $3,920, respectively, last week before closing Sunday (UTC) largely unchanged at $3,970. The price swing formed what’s termed a doji candle on the weekly chart, which is usually taken to represent indecision in the marketplace. The candle, however, has appeared following a 20 percent rally from lows near $3,300 seen at the end of January. So, it could be argued that the indecision, as represented by the doji, is predominantly among the buyers. As a result, the probability of BTC ending the ongoing consolidation with a convincing break below $3,920 appears high. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,970 on Bitstamp, largely changed on a 24-hour basis.  As seen above, BTC created a doji candle at the crucial 21-week moving average (MA) resistance, validating the bearish view put forward by that still-downward sloping momentum indicator. The case for the downside break of the $3,920–$4,055 trading range looks stronger if we take into account the price action seen over the last five weeks. To start with, BTC hit a high of $4,190 and created a bullish inverted hammer candle in the third week of February – a sign the market is bottoming out. That candlestick is usually followed by a quick move to the higher side. In the last four weeks, however, BTC has failed to again challenge $4,190, weakening the bullish case.  On the daily chart, the short-term MA studies are now biased toward the bears, with the 5-day MA having dropped below the 10-day MA. Further, with the price well below the March 21 high of $4,055, the bearish outside-reversal candle created on that day is still valid. So, the sideways channel seen in the 4-hour chart could be breached to the downside in the next day or two. A range breakdown if confirmed would open the doors for a deeper drop toward $3,658 (Feb. 27 low). A UTC close well above $4,055 would revive the short-term bullish view and could yield a rally toward $4,200, although gains may be short-lived, as the 21-week MA is still trending south.

0," Yesterday, there were further gains in bitcoin above the USD 4,040 and USD 4,050 levels. BTC/USD traded to a new weekly high close to USD 4,070, but it failed to hold gains. As a result, there was a strong decline below the USD 4,000 and USD 3,980 support levels. The price tested the USD 3,900 support level and later rebounded above USD 3,950. Similarly, there was a downward move in ethereum and ripple below the USD 135 and USD 0.310 support levels respectively. Both corrected higher, but facing many hurdles on the upside.  Total market capitalization  Buyers pushed bitcoin price  above the USD 4,000 and USD 4,025 resistance levels. BTC/USD traded to a new weekly high near USD 4,070 before it declined heavily. Sellers gained momentum and pushed the price below the USD 4,000, USD 3,980 and USD 3,950 support levels. The price tested the USD 3,900 support level and later corrected higher.
BTC climbed above the USD 3,950 and USD 3,960 levels, but it is facing a strong resistance near the USD 4,000 and USD 4,010 levels. A successful close above USD 4,010 is must for further upsides. If not, there is a risk of a fresh drop to USD 3,900. Ethereum price  also followed a similar pattern and declined sharply after it failed to clear the USD 140 resistance. ETH broke the USD 135 support, tested the USD 132 support, and later recovered above the USD 135 level.
The price is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) trading in a range near the USD 135 level, with many hurdles near the USD 136 and USD 138 levels. If buyers fail to push the price above USD 138, there could be another dip towards USD 132. Bitcoin cash price  declined sharply below the USD 155 and USD 150 support levels. BCH/USD tested the USD 145 support and recently corrected above USD 150. An immediate resistance is at USD 154, followed by USD 155.
EOS  failed to stay above the USD 3.70 support and declined below USD 3.60. It tested the USD 3.50 support and recovered above USD 3.55. However, the previous support at USD 3.60 is now acting as a resistance.
Ripple price  faced a solid rise in selling pressure after it broke the USD 0.310 support. XRP/USD fell below USD 0.305 and even spiked below USD 0.300. The price later recovered above USD 0.305, but the USD 0.310 level is preventing gains. In the past three sessions, many small cap altcoins trimmed gains and declined between 5%-10%, including MOAC, ONT, KCS, CRO, HT, LRC, LINK, ICX, BTT and KMD. Out of these, MOAC is down around 10% and ONT fell close to 9.5%. Overall, bitcoin price recovered after a sharp decline below USD 3,950. However, BTC/USD must surpass the USD 4,000 and USD 4,010 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. If not, there is a risk of another slide in the coming sessions towards USD 3,920 or USD 3,900.

0," Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped back from levels over $4,000, but the short-term outlook will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above key support at $3,920. The crypto market leader jumped to a 25-day high of $4,055 yesterday, having secured a bullish UTC close above the psychological hurdle of $4,000 on Wednesday, going by Bitstamp data. The breakout above the crucial three-day chart resistance of $4,040, however, was short-lived with prices falling back to a five-day low of $3,920 before closing the day at $3,974. Notably, the negative price action engulfed the trading range seen in the previous four days, which is widely considered an early sign of bull exhaustion. That said, the path of least resistance is still to the higher side, as the bounce from lows near $3,920 has left the bullish higher lows pattern intact along the trendline connecting the Feb. 8 and Mar.4 lows. For the immediate outlook to turn bearish, the engulfing price action seen yesterday needs a strong follow through in the form of a convincing break below $3,920. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,980, representing a 1.28 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  On the daily chart, BTC created a bearish outside reversal candle yesterday as trading began on an optimistic note but ended with pessimism. A bullish-to-bearish trend change, however, would be confirmed only if prices close below $3,920 (low of the bearish candle) today. A move below $3,920 would confirm a downside break of the ascending trendline and shift risk in favor of a deeper drop toward the Feb. 27 low of $3,658. On the higher side, a break above $4,055 would reinforce the short-term bullish setup and could fuel a rally toward the recent high of $4,190.  The odds of a rally toward $4,235 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline) would strengthen if the current three-day candle closes (today) above $4,040, validating the bullish engulfing candle created in three days to March 16.

0," Twitter and Square founder Jack Dorsey has always been bullish in his Bitcoin views. So it’s no surprise that his payments startup Square is now offering new employees the chance to be paid in Bitcoin. According to tweets from the CEO, the company is on the hunt for skilled labor to add to the team. If Dorsey’s tweets are anything to go by, then the company is hiring engineers and a designer to “work full-time on open source contributions to the bitcoin/crypto ecosystem.”  The Square cash app already supports Bitcoin purchases and sales so it is intriguing to think of what these new hires may be working on.  But beyond that tweet, information is scarce. However, what is notable, is that these new hires will be able to be paid in Bitcoin if they so choose. It makes sense that Square would offer this option, Dorsey being a major advocate of cryptocurrency, earning himself the nickname Bitcoin Evangelist. His belief is that Bitcoin should become the world’s single native currency and using it is moving forward. >> Polymath Partners with SeriesOne for Security Token Issuance Dorsey added in a separate Tweet that “the most impactful thing” his company can do is to build upon the current cryptocurrency ecosystem. And this is one way it can give back to the community. He commented: “Square has taken a lot from the open source community to get us here. We haven’t given enough back. This is a small way to give back, and one that’s aligned with our broader interests: a more accessible global financial system for the internet.” Dorsey recently spoke in a podcast about the Square app saying how payment apps like it are the future for cryptocurrency: “We’re empowering the electrician to send invoices, setting up the food truck with a delivery option, helping the clothing boutique pay its employees, and giving the coffee chain capital for a second, third, and fourth location.” What do you think?

0," One of the biggest Bitcoin proponents, Jack Dorsey, CEO of the social media giant Twitter, just announced to his 4 million followers that he's hiring a new team of 3-4 engineers and a designer in order to help the crypto ecosystem. The new team is going to work as a division of Square (Square Crypto), a payment provider co-founded by Dorsey. The team would report directly to Dorsey, who's also the CEO of Square. ""This will be Square’s first open source initiative independent of our business objectives. These folks will focus entirely on what’s best for the crypto community and individual economic empowerment, not on Square’s commercial interests. All resulting work will be open and free,"" the CEO tweeted without elaborating on who will decide ""what’s best for the crypto community."" According to Dorsey, Square has taken a lot from the open source community and this is a small way to give back. Moreover, ""it's aligned with our broader interests: a more accessible global financial system for the internet."" Also, the CEO stressed that they're adding a designer to the team because ""this is an underfunded area in the crypto ecosystem"" and ""great design will help more people access this technology faster and better.""

Quite exhilarating to see the co-author of the leanest social media protocol publicly embrace and support the leanest money-over-internet protocol. https://t.co/f81caiBNJg ____ This year, Twitter’s bitcoin-friendly CEO is constantly making headlines in the cryptoverse. Recently, he tweeted out his public support for the Trezor hardware wallet. Also, he endorsed Casa Node, a plug-and-play solution for running a Bitcoin and Lightning Network node. (Dorsey is among investors in Lighting Labs, developer of the Lightning Network.) Moreover, in a recent The Tales from the Crypt podcast, Dorsey revealed more about just how positively he views bitcoin, saying he recently “maxed out” his weekly bitcoin buying limit on the Cash App. That limit is currently USD 10,000 per week. He has also previously expressed his support for the idea of a bitcoin tipping functionality for Twitter, and even said that he believes bitcoin will become the world’s single currency."
0," Bitcoin’s (BTC) 14-month bear market has ended up creating a similar price pattern to one that paved the way for a bull run in 2015. The cryptomarket leader is currently trading at $4,030 on Bitstamp, having hit a low of $3,122 in December. Despite the recovery rally, the price is still down 79.85 percent from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017. Throughout the sell-off, the cryptocurrency has charted a series of lower highs and lower lows, known as descending channel in technical parlance. Bitcoin produced a similar pattern during the previous bear market witnessed in 2014–2015. More importantly, the upside break of that falling channel, confirmed in October 2015, was followed by a two-year bull market. Therefore, a potential upside break of the latest falling channel could be considered a sign of a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  As can be seen above, the price action seen over the last 14 months looks very similar to that seen in 2014 and early 2015. The previous bear market had stalled with the 14-week relative strength index (RSI) hitting oversold levels below 30 in January 2015. Similarly, the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 hit in December 2017 also ran out of steam with the RSI falling below 30 in December 2018. So, if history repeats itself, the cryptocurrency may see a sustained channel breakout later this year. An early move above the upper edge of the channel, currently at $4,070, could be seen as several indicators are flashing early signs of bullish reversal. Further, BTC is trading just below the breakout price at press time. Such an early move, however, could be short-lived or may lack a strong follow-through as long as the 21-week moving average (MA) is trending south. As of writing, the MA resistance is seen at $4,073.  Both the higher lows-higher highs pattern and the ascending 5- and 10-day MAs seen on the daily chart indicate the path of least resistance is to the higher side. As a result, the cryptocurrency may soon validate the bullish outside reversal candle on the three-day chart with a convincing move above $4,040, as discussed yesterday. That would allow a rally to recent highs near $4,200. The short-term bullish case would weaken if prices drop below $3,927 (Mar. 17 low).

1," After a short term downside correction, bitcoin price found support and recovered above USD 3,950. BTC/USD is climbing higher and it is currently (UTC 08:10 AM) trading just above the USD 4,000 resistance, with a bullish angle. Therefore, there are chances of more upsides above USD 4,025 and USD 4,050 in the coming sessions. On the other hand, ethereum price was mostly flat, but it stayed above the USD 135 and USD 136 support levels. Ripple price started a short term rebound and climbed above the USD 0.313 level. It seems like XRP/USD is preparing for an upward move above USD 0.314 and USD 0.315. Total market capitalization  In the past few hours, bitcoin price  managed to gain traction as it broke the USD 3,980 and USD 4,000 resistance levels. BTC/USD is up around 0.5% and it seems like it could break the USD 4,025 resistance and revisit the USD 4,050 level. If there are further gains, the price may target the USD 4,100 level. 
On the downside, the USD 4,000 and USD 3,980 levels are likely to act as supports. If buyers fail to retain strength, the price could decline back towards the USD 3,950 support. Ethereum price  remained well bid above the USD 135 and USD 136 support levels. However, ETH/USD is facing a strong resistance near the USD 138 level, above which there are chances of a break above the USD 140 resistance level.
If sellers remain in action near USD 138 or USD 140, the price could revisit the USD 135 support. Any further losses may push the price into a bearish zone, with the next support at USD 130. Bitcoin cash price  started a downside correction below the USD 160 support. BCH/USD is currently down around 1% and it seems like it could test the USD 155 support level in the near term.
EOS  is currently consolidating above the USD 3.65 support level. To start a fresh bullish wave, the price must break the USD 3.75 and USD 3.80 resistance levels. The main resistance above USD 3.80 is at USD 4.00.
Ripple price  managed to stay above the USD 0.312 support and it is currently correcting higher. If XRP/USD surpasses the USD 0.314 and USD 0.315 resistance levels, there could be decent gains towards USD 0.320. During the past two sessions, many small cap altcoins started an upward move and gained more than 10%, including XTZ, GXC, HT, RVN, PAI, CRO, ZEC and IOST. Out of these, XTZ is up more than 17% and GXC gained nearly 16%. The current price action suggests bitcoin price is gaining momentum above USD 4,000. Having said that, BTC/USD must move above the USD 4,025 and USD 4,050 resistance levels to start a solid upward move. On the other hand, ethereum is stuck in a range and it is likely preparing for the next break.

1," Bitcoin’s (BTC) bulls need to break key resistance at $4,040 to force a continued rally, the three-day chart indicates. The leading cryptocurrency by market value is trapped in the range of 3,920-$4,020 for the fourth consecutive day, having created a bullish outside-reversal or “engulfing” candle in the three days to March 16. A bullish engulfing candle occurs when the period begins with pessimism but ends on an optimistic note, engulfing the preceding period’s price action. While it is widely considered a bullish signal, traders usually wait for confirmation in the form of strong follow through, preferably a convincing move above the high of the engulfing candle. Put simply, a break above $4,040 – the high of the candle – is needed to validate the indicator. That would further reinforce the short-term bullish outlook put forward by the long-tailed doji candle created on Feb. 27 and allow a re-test of the recent highs near $4,200. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,986 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.3 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  The small doji candle created in the last three trading days has taken the shine off the preceding bullish outside reversal candle. A convincing move above $4,040 (candle’s high) will likely invite strong buying pressure and yield a rally to the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance, currently at $4,230. That possibility looks likely, as the 5- and 10-candle moving averages (MAs) are biased bullish and BTC’s price is still holding above the ascending trendline. However, any gains above the 21-week simple moving average (SMA) at $4,073 could be short-lived, as that average is still trending south, as discussed earlier this week.  On the 4-hour chart, BTC is struggling to force a descending triangle breakout, which, if confirmed, would boost the prospects of prices finding acceptance above the crucial resistance at $4,040. A break below the triangle low of $3,927, however, could yield a deeper pullback to $3,850. That said, a bearish reversal would be confirmed only if the support at $3,658 (Feb. 27 low) is breached.

1," After a strong upward move, bitcoin price corrected lower and settled below the USD 4,000 level. BTC/USD is currently (UTC 08:00 AM) consolidating in a range and facing a solid resistance near the USD 4,000 level. If it continues to face sellers near USD 4,000, there could be a short-term bearish reaction towards the USD 3,900 support area. Similarly, ethereum price is now trading below the USD 140 resistance and struggling to climb higher. Ripple price seems to be consolidating above USD 0.312, but there is a risk of a downside extension towards the USD 0.310 support. We are in a: Total market capitalization  After bullish moves, bitcoin price  declined below USD 4,000 and tested the USD 3,950 support level. Later, BTC/USD started trading in a tight range and it seems like buyers are finding it hard to clear the USD 4,000 and USD 4,010 resistance levels. If they continue to struggle, there is a risk of a downside reaction towards the USD 3,950 or USD 3,900 support area.
On the other hand, a proper close and follow through above USD 4,000 may perhaps call for more upsides above the USD 4,050 resistance level in the coming sessions. Ethereum price  corrected lower and settled below the USD 140 support level. ETH/USD is currently trading well below the USD 140 support, with a bearish angle and it seems like it could decline towards the USD 135 support.
On the upside, the main resistance is at USD 140, above which the price is likely to revisit the USD 145 resistance area and this month’s high. Bitcoin cash price  faced a strong selling interest near the USD 165 level and it recently corrected below the USD 160 level. BCH/USD may continue to move down and it could test the next key support at USD 150.
EOS  is moving lower and it is currently trading below USD 3.70. An immediate support is at USD 3.65, below which the price could decline towards the USD 3.62 support. On the upside, the key resistances are USD 3.75 and USD 3.80.
Ripple price  failed to stay in the positive zone and declined below the USD 0.314 support. XRP/USD is currently holding the USD 0.312 support, but there is a risk of more losses towards the USD 0.311 or USD 0.310 support zone. Despite bearish moves in ethereum and ripple, a few small cap altcoins gained traction, including KIN, RVN, MXM, KCS, KNC, ENJ, XLM and WAN. Out of these, KIN rallied more than 35% and RVN is up close to 15%. Overall, bitcoin is trading in a tight range and it seems to be preparing for the next break either above USD 4,000 or below USD 3,950. If there is a downside correction, BTC buyers are likely to protect the key USD 3,900 support, which was a solid resistance this past week.

1," Bitcoin’s dominance rate, or its share of the total cryptocurrency market, is on the verge of falling below 50 percent for the first time in over seven months.  At press time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency accounts for 50.9 percent of the total capitalization of the entire market and fell as low as 50.54 on March 17, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Before 2017, bitcoin’s dominance rate was perpetually in excess of 70 percent, but it began to deflate as new cryptocurrencies were created and sold to investors in initial coin offerings (ICOs), causing bitcoin’s dominance rate to drop to a low of 32.48 percent on Jan. 13, 2018.  Since, Aug. 11 of last year, however, bitcoin’s share of the cryptocurrency market has not fallen below 50 percent.  Having traded between $3,200 and $4,300 since Dec. 2018, bitcoin’s recent drop in market dominance can be attributed to a strong performance from the broader altcoin market, comprised of all cryptocurrencies excluding bitcoin, rather than any significant depreciation to its own market.  In the past 90 days alone, names like enjin (ENJ), binance coin (BNB) and litecoin (LTC) have witnessed significant price increases of 406, 181 and 97 percent respectively, according to data from Messari. As a result, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding bitcoin has grown 33 percent since hitting a 2019 low of $51 billion on Feb. 6 to its current value of roughly $69 billion.  In the same time span, bitcoin’s market capitalization has also seen notable growth, but to a lesser extent than the altcoin market. Since Feb. 6, bitcoin’s market cap has increased from $59 billion to its current value of $71 billion – a jump of 20 percent. Bitcoin’s shrinking dominance could be seen as a sign the crypto markets are shifting to a “risk-on” environment where investors prefer riskier assets, as altcoins are perceived to be. The rate falling below 50 percent would be a greater indication of this type of sentiment coming to fruition. As it stands, the total capitalization of the broader cryptocurrency market records $140.6 billion, down 83 percent from its all-time high of $835 billion set on Jan. 7, 2018.

1," Bitcoin (BTC) is showing signs of buyer exhaustion and could see a minor pullback unless resistance at $4,000 is scaled in the next few hours. The crypto market leader witnessed two-way business yesterday before closing (UTC) on a flat note at $3,969 on Bitstamp. Essentially, BTC created a doji candle, which is widely considered a sign of indecision in the marketplace. Notably, the fact that the doji candle has appeared close to the historically strong resistance of the 21-week simple moving average (SMA), currently at $4,073, suggests the indecision is predominantly among the bulls and could be considered a sign of buyer exhaustion. So, a price pullback could be on the way, especially if support at $3,930 is breached in the next few hours. That said, the rally from the March 14 low of $3,775 could resume if prices rise above the resistance at $4,000, invalidating the doji candle. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,975, representing a 0.4 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  On the daily chart, BTC looks to be creating the right shoulder of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, having bounced up from the rising trendline last week. The 5- and 10-day MAs are also trending north, indicating a bullish setup. Even so, the rally has stalled near $4,000 and a doji candle has appeared, validating the bearish view put forward by the descending 21-week SMA, currently at $4,073. BTC, therefore, risks falling back to the rising trendline support at $3,890. A break lower would expose the March 14 low of $3,775. It’s worth noting that bitcoin may have a tough time scaling or holding onto gains above the 21-week SMA as long as that average is trending south.  As can be seen, BTC has created a minor bull flag – a continuation pattern that usually accelerates the preceding bullish move. A break above the upper edge of the flag, currently at $4,000, would open the doors to $4,305 (target as per the measured move method) However, the bullish exhaustion signaled by the doji candle would gain credence if prices fall below the flag support at $3,930. In that case, BTC will likely revisit key support levels at $3,890 and $3,755. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

1," On Monday, the sentiment surrounding the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization is more positive than a week ago, according to Predicoin, a crypto market sentiment analysis service. Moreover, Bitcoin Sentscore seems to be back to the range it had before mid-November crash, according to Pierre-Alexandre Picard, co-founder and CMO of Predicoin.  Bitcoin SentScore since August 2019: Meanwhile, the average market sentiment score among the top ten today is 5.65, again higher than last week (5.43) and marking yet another improvement on a week-by-week basis. For Bitcoin, it's fourth Monday in a row with the highest score (6.7) out of the top 10.

- 4,5 to 5,5: Neutral zone
- 5,5 to 7,5: somewhat positive zone
- 7,5 to 10: very positive This is Stellar’s first time on the winning list since we started these weekly updates in February 2019, and only its second time above the negative range. Part of the buzz, which shows the intensity of social interest for a coin, around Stellar comes from the fact that the congregation of payments, FinTech and financial services industry called the Money 20/20 conference in Asia is due to start tomorrow, March 19th, and will feature Stellar’s co-founder Jed McCaleb as one of the speakers, Picard suggested. Also, it is expected that Stellar will make a joint announcement with information technology giant IBM, as Jesse Lund, IBM’s Head of Blockchain and Digital Currencies, will join McCaleb on stage. (Updated: On Monday, IBM announced a payments network based on blockchain and the Stellar protocol.) Meanwhile, despite an increase, XRP  still has the lowest score of 4.5, which marks the line between the negative and neutral zones. The last time this coin has entered neutral territory was February 25th, when it managed to get a score of 4.7. The neutral list holds Tether (4.6) and TRON (5.1), where the former dropped compared to last week, while the latter rose. Tether’s drop can, at least partially, be attributed to the news that its USD 2 billion token supply is now backed by not only real US dollars, but other assets, also, according to Picard.  Bitcoin Cash and XRP are both winners in the weekly change category with 8.7% improvement compared to last week. Bitcoin Cash found its strength in news, which got a score of 7.8, while its weakest spot are fundamentals with 3.1. XRP’s score explains its total score and why it’s so low: news are again on their side with 6.4, but the technical side only scored 2.3. The biggest loser is Binance Coin with a drop of 1.8%, followed by Ethereum with -1.6% and Bitcoin with -1.5%. However, all of them still remain on the winning list. Binance Coin’s strength is technical, with 7.5, while its weakness is fundamental - 3.7. Ethereum’s strength is also news with 6.4, but weakness is also technical with 3.5. Bitcoin’s fundamentals are soaring at 8.6, while the social aspect - at 4.5 - leaves something to be desired.

1," This past week, there was a solid upward move in bitcoin above the USD 3,900 and USD 4,000 resistance levels. BTC/USD tested the USD 4,050 level and later corrected lower. It is currently (UTC 08:00 AM) trading below USD 4,000, with many supports on the downside above USD 3,900. Similarly, there were bullish moves in ethereum price above USD 135 and USD 140. ETH tested the USD 145 resistance and recently corrected below USD 140. Ripple price spiked above the USD 0.320 resistance on two occasions, but it failed to hold gains and later corrected towards the USD 0.312 support. Total market capitalization  Finally, there was a strong bullish wave in bitcoin price  above the USD 3,900 resistance. BTC/USD even broke the USD 4,000 weekly resistance area before sellers emerged near the USD 4,050 level. A high was formed just below USD 4,060 before the price started a downside correction.
The price is currently trading below the USD 4,000 level, with an immediate support at USD 3,950 and 3,940. However, the main weekly support is at USD 3,900, which was a key resistance earlier. On the upside, the key resistances are near USD 4,000 and USD 4,050. Ethereum price  also followed a similar pattern and climbed above the USD 135 and USD 140 resistance levels. ETH/USD tested the USD 145 resistance and later corrected below the USD 140 level.
The main weekly supports are at USD 135 and USD 132, below which there is a risk of more losses below the USD 130 support in the near term. On the upside, the USD 140 level is an initial resistance, followed by the USD 145 pivot level. Bitcoin cash  performed well recently as it rallied above the USD 140 and USD 148 resistance levels. BCH/USD even surged above USD 160 before sellers appeared near USD 165. It is currently correcting lower, with supports near USD 155 and USD 150.
EOS  made another attempt to clear the USD 3.80 resistance, but buyers failed to gain momentum. The price is currently correcting below USD 3.75 and it may continue to decline towards the USD 3.65 or USD 3.62 support area.
Ripple price  spiked on a couple of occasions towards the USD 0.320 resistance, but it failed to stay above USD 0.320 and USD 0.318. XRP/USD corrected lower recently and tested the USD 0.314 support. The next main supports are USD 0.312 and USD 0.310. Despite dips in bitcoin and ETH, a few small cap altcoins traded higher and gained more than 8%, including WAX, GXC, KCS, CRO, R and BCH. Out of these, WAX rallied more than 11% and GXC is up around 10%. Overall, the recent upward move in bitcoin was encouraging, but the current correction wave must find support near USD 3,950 or USD 3,920. On the upside, a fresh daily close above USD 4,000 could trigger renewed buying interest in BTC in the coming sessions.

1," Bitcoin’s (BTC) four-week price rally now faces a former support-turned-resistance level that repeatedly capped gains in 2018. The crypto market leader closed (UTC) yesterday at $3,965, representing a 1.73 percent gain on a weekly basis, according to Bitstamp data. That was the fourth straight weekly gain and the longest winning streak since April 2018. With strong volumes backing bitcoin’s move to a three-week high of $4,040 over the weekend, the case for an extension of the ongoing recovery rally from January lows looks strong. However, a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change above $4,236 may remain elusive for few weeks, as the 21-month simple moving average (SMA) – a technical line which acted as strong resistance in 2018 – is currently located at $4,073. More importantly, the average line is still trending south in favor of the bears, and bitcoin is not likely to breach it with a 90-degree rally. Further, with BTC struggling to hold on to gains above $4,000 for the third day running, the bullish momentum is beginning to wane. As of writing, the BTC is changing hands at $3,955 on Bitstamp, having hit a high of $4,016 earlier today.  On the weekly chart, bitcoin printed bullish higher lows along the 21-week SMA throughout the 2016-2017 uptrend. The average support was breached on Jan. 29, 2018, and has reversed rallies ever since. As such, a convincing move above that SMA, currently at $4,073, could be considered an early sign of a long-term bullish reversal. It is often observed that markets tend to consolidate post-break above a downward sloping MA and pick up a strong bid once the average has shed bearish bias (bottomed out). For instance, BTC jumped above the descending 100-day MA on Feb. 19, but the follow-through quickly fizzled out near $4,200 and prices fell back to the long-term MA on March 4. More importantly, bitcoin lacked clear directional bias and rose back to $4,000 only after the average turned flat on March 14. Thus, any break above the 21-week SMA needs to be viewed with caution as long as the average line is trending south. A repeated rejection at the average line could invite selling pressure, as seen in November.  On the daily, BTC closed above $3,950 (Mar. 9 high) on Saturday, bolstering the short-term bullish setup as indicated by both the ascending trendline and the upward sloping 5- and 10-day MAs. So far, however, the follow-through has been anything but bullish, which adds credence to the possibility of a pause in upward momentum suggested by the weekly chart.

1," Bitcoin’s user growth, as represented by active addresses, has spiked in the last eight weeks leaving the price far behind, a move that contradicts the popular belief the two tend to move in tandem. The 30 day average of active addresses on bitcoin’s blockchain, or the number of accounts that made cryptocurrency transactions at any point during the last 24 hours, total 664,064 as of March 16– up 17 percent from 569,812 seen on Jan. 20. Bitcoin’s 30 day average price, however, has increased just 1 percent during the same time span, according to Coinmetrics. An uptick in active addresses is taken by many as a sign of the cryptocurrency’s increasing popularity or investor confidence. The active addresses count, however, tends to rise even when long-term dormant “HODLers” move out of the cryptocurrency and into fiat. So, betting on a price rise every time active addresses spike could prove costly. Other network activity metrics like the network volume and the transaction amount to active addresses ratio (TAAR) tend to shed more light on how network activity impacts bitcoin’s price.  *coinmetrics.io As can be seen above, the divergence between active addresses and bitcoin’s price has become quite large, which perhaps comes as a surprise given the two rose and fell in unison for much of 2018. But while the divergence between the two metrics is indeed growing, it’s hardly been the first time such a development has occurred. For instance, active addresses maintained notable growth throughout the entire bear market that spanned nearly two years from 2014 to early 2016, which implies active addresses may not be the most predictive fundamental metric for bitcoin’s price. Since active addresses are only a measure of how many accounts are actively making transactions, other metrics like network volume and TAAR can be used to provide insight into the actual amount of funds the addresses are spending. As can be seen in the chart below, the 30-day average of bitcoin’s network volume, or the amount of funds (USD) transmitted through its blockchain, appears to have a much stronger relationship with the price of BTC/USD than the trend of active addresses. Perhaps not coincidentally, when viewed on Coinmetrics’ semi-log graph, the 30-day avg. of transaction volume has been quite precise in identifying bitcoin market tops and bottoms, as depicted by the average line either falling below or rising above prices.  *coinmetrics.io Upon closer examination, it can be seen the network volume has also seen an uptick over the past couple of weeks. The 30-day average of network volume has increased from $2.24 billion on Feb. 17, to $2.86 billion on March 16, an increase of roughly 27 percent. In the same time bitcoin’s average price increased just over 8 percent from $3,568 to $3,862. Indeed, bitcoin’s transaction volume appears to track prices more accurately, but since the number of active addresses is also a valid reflection network usage, it’s worth viewing how the interplay between the two impact bitcoin’s price, if at all. First introduced by founder of Pugilist Ventures, Chris Brookins, the TAAR metric “acts as an “equilibrium” gauge of bitcoin’s price to fundamentals valuation, where transaction volume and active addresses both represent “quantity and quality” growth of the bitcoin network” In other words, TAAR represents how the interplay between the two metrics that measure the quantity (transaction volume) and quality (active addresses) of network activity impacts bitcoin’s price as opposed to viewing their effects in isolation.  While the sample size is small, spanning only a few years, it is clear that bitcoin’s market reacts positively when the TAAR is in an uptrend and reacts negatively when it is not. As can be seen, however, the TAAR is still in an apparent downtrend and has deviated from bitcoin’s price trend, indicating the fundamental metrics that measure the quality and quantity of activity on bitcoin’s blockchain is not at equilibrium with its price. Active addresses are indeed growing faster than bitcoin’s price is increasing, but the metric only tells half the story. The amount of funds passed through the blockchain, known as network volume, is also a key measure of network activity, as it shows how much is being transferred, not just how many accounts are conducting transactions. When the interplay between the two is depicted, the TAAR metric shows bitcoin’s network activity has room to grow before confirming a bullish effect on the market.

1," Bitcoin is going to spend a lot of time below USD 6,000 sort of fixing itself and it might take 5-6 months before it starts to look like it’s back in a bull market, Head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors and famous Bitcoin bull Tom Lee said. “I think 2019 is a year about repair,” Lee said in an interview with CNBC, adding, “We have a risk-on rally in global markets that's positive for Bitcoin; it was a headwind last year. And the dollar isn't surging like it was last year. That's a headwind that's gone away.” The interest that both traditional financial institutions and other entities such as social networks are showing for crypto assets is also going to boost the price forward, he believes.  “We've seen the launch of digital currencies by not only JPMorgan and Mizuho Bank, but also Facebook and some social media companies gearing up. And, of course, in places like Venezuela, where bitcoin's become very large and widely used, turmoil is causing adoption growth. So I think these are really setting up for a strong ... year,” he said. But how can you tell where the price is headed? The secret lies in watching 200-day moving averages, Lee believes. The moving average is the calculation of the closing prices of an asset over a period of time, and if Bitcoin keeps at its current trading price of below USD 4,000, “it'll cross above its 200-day by August,” he believes. The real damage was dealt during the Bitcoin Cash fork wars, when the whole market collapsed, mid-November 2018. “I think it really undermined investor confidence in sort of the dynamics around the market, so I think that bitcoin's going to spend a lot of time below USD 6,000 sort of fixing itself,” he explained, adding that ""the outside window is five or six months before bitcoin starts to look technically like it’s back in a bull market.” According to 2019 Outlook report for the cryptocurrency market, published by Fundstrat in February, the firm admits that 2018 was a disappointing year for crypto, while also adding that they expect the market to stage “a visible recovery” in 2019.  Meanwhile, popular cryptocurrency analyst Murad Mahmudov and Arjun Balaji, an independent blockchain researcher, reportedly see the Bitcoin bottom in the USD 2,000 - USD 2,500 range by the end of summer 2019, while another crypto analyst and trader Tone Vays is the one to go as low as USD 1,300. Tom Lee started out by saying that Bitcoin could climb back to USD 20,000 by mid-2018 and even reach USD 25,000 by the end of December of that year. He later amended this end-of-the-year forecast, pulling it down to a USD 20,000 - USD 22,000 range. Then in November, when Bitcoin was trading at around USD 5,500, Lee was certain the price would triple in the remaining month and a half. When all his forecasts failed, he maintained that the market was wrong and that Bitcoin’s true value lied between USD 13,800 and USD 14,800 in December 2018. In January 2019, he confirmed that USD 25,000 per Bitcoin forecast is a good value for the cryptocurrency, but that the timing “may be difficult.”

1," In the past few hours, there were many swing moves in bitcoin above the USD 3,880 resistance. BTC even fell sharply below USD 3,850, but downsides were limited. The price is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) trading with a positive bias above the USD 3,880 level and it seems like buyers are eyeing an upside break above USD 3,900 and USD 3,950. Ethereum price retested the USD 130 support and bounced back above USD 132. ETH/USD is moving higher and it may clear the USD 135 resistance in the near term. Ripple price is currently consolidating above USD 0.311 and it might rise towards the USD 0.314 and 0.315 resistance levels.  Total market capitalization  After a sharp dip below the USD 3,850 support, bitcoin price  bounced back. BTC/USD is trading above the USD 3,850 support, with a positive angle. The current technical structure is positive and it seems like there are high chances of an upside break above the USD 3,900 and USD 3,920 resistance levels.
The next key resistances are at USD 3,950 and USD 4,000. If there is a downside correction below the USD 3,850 support, the price could revisit the USD 3,800 support level. Ethereum price  also followed a similar pattern and declined sharply below the USD 131 and 130 levels. Later, ETH/USD recovered and settled above USD 132.
The price is trading higher, with signs of an upside break above the USD 134 and USD 135 resistance levels. If buyers fail again, the price will likely revisit the USD 130 support area in the coming sessions. Bitcoin cash price  increased steadily above the USD 130 and USD 131 resistance levels. BCH/USD is currently trading above USD 132 and it could rise towards the USD 134 and USD 135 resistance levels. On the downside, the USD 130 level is the key support.
EOS  is again attempting to clear the USD 3.60 resistance level. If it succeeds, the next stop for buyers could be USD 3.70 or USD 3.75. On the downside, the main supports are near USD 3.55 and USD 3.50. 
Ripple price  is trading flat above the USD 0.310 and 0.311 levels and facing a lot of hurdles near the USD 0.312, USD 0.314 and USD 0.315 levels. If there is a downside break below the USD 0.310 support, XRP could decline towards the USD 0.305 support. In the past two sessions, many small cap altcoins extended gains and moved up by more than 8%, including CRO, LSK, DGTX, QTUM, MCO, WAN, XVG, XEM, DCR and PPT. Out of these, CRO rallied more than 50% and LSK is up close to 20%. The overall technical formation is suggesting gains in bitcoin as long as there is no daily close below USD 3,800. On the upside, BTC must gain strength above the USD 3,900, USD 3,950 and USD 4,000 resistance levels to continue higher.

1," The former CEO of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox, Mark Karpeles, will likely avoid having to serve prison time in Japan after receiving a suspended sentence. Karpeles was on Friday found guilty by the Tokyo District Court for tampering with the exchange’s financial records, as well as mixing his personal finances with those of the exchange, according to multiple media reports. However, the court dismissed the embezzlement charges that had also been raised against Karpeles, saying he “acted without ill intent.” Karpeles originally faced a prison term of up to 10 years in Japan for the embezzlement charges. “The charge of electronic record tampering is true and deserves punishment, but there’s no criminal evidence of embezzlement,” the court said, Bloomberg reported. It further blamed the 33-year-old Frenchman for “massive harm to the trust of his users.”  “There is no excuse for the defendant, who is an engineer with expert knowledge, to abuse his status and authority to perform clever criminal acts,” the court said, before giving him a 2 1/2 year “suspended sentence,” which does not need to be served unless another crime is committed within four years. Karpeles, who has maintained his innocence throughout the trial, was also ordered to pay for part of the cost of the trial. Finished reading Karpeles verdict. In summary, the court found that the way he ran Mt. Gox was a total mess and that he tampered w/ records to hide the fact it was missing a lot of Bitcoin, but he did not do it for personal gain or have ill intent. Attaching relevant parts. pic.twitter.com/3n7oEwSsK0 “I am happy to be judged not guilty for embezzlement and breach of trust. I will discuss with my lawyers and decide how to proceed on the remaining charge,” Karpeles told CNN in a brief comment. Mark Karpeles bought Mt. Gox, which was originally a marketplace for illustrated cards, in 2011 and turned it into the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. In 2014, the exchange collapsed in a spectacular fashion after 850,000 bitcoins were stolen, leading to a loss of nearly USD 500 million for users of the exchange. To this day, the majority of the missing bitcoins have yet to be recovered. More than four years after the infamous Mt. Gox incident victims have been filing rehabilitation claims and are now waiting to be reimbursed. However, it seems that they might need to wait even longer, as two different entities are slowing down the process: cryptocurrency company CoinLab, headed by CEO Peter Vessenes, and former child actor and crypto entrepreneur Brock Pierce, as previously reported. _____

1," The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) has announced that its CFE futures exchange platform will not be adding a Bitcoin (XBT) futures contract this month. The exchange operator also says it is currently considering its future stance on cryptocurrency derivatives trading. According to an official release, the CFE operator stated, “The CFE is assessing its approach with respect to how it plans to continue to offer digital asset derivatives for trading. While it considers its next steps, the CFE does not currently intend to list additional XBT futures contracts for trading.” The exchange noted, however, that “currently listed XBT futures contracts remain available for trading” – meaning existing futures listed last month (XBTM19) will continue to run until June. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts on Twitter and Reddit speculated that low trading volumes and competitor success may have been contributing factors in the CBOE’s decision. That's cause Cboe bitcoin futures trading volumes have been getting crushed by CME. pic.twitter.com/4dpi9Tfuwg Rival CME exchange last month announced it had hit a new record of 18,338 bitcoin futures contracts traded, equivalent to around USD 360 million – although figures from March have been significantly lower. Meanwhile, the Unites States’ top financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is still deliberating whether or not to approve a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), and some claim the latest CBOE decision does not bode well in this regard. MisterLister lamented on Twitter, “ETF approval can’t be further away at this point.”

1," Daily trading volume for the world’s largest cryptocurrency bitcoin exceeded $11 billion Friday, the most observed in a 24-hour period since April 25 of last year. At that time, the average price of bitcoin was $8,845, while today the crypto asset is listed for less than half the price, currently trading at $3,951 as per CoinMarketCap. However, the return in volume is potentially a sign investors aren’t losing interest in bitcoin despite the less than favorable market conditions. Interestingly, the amount of bitcoin trade volume had closely aligned with it’s price trend for years, but upon closer examination, the close connection ended during the latest market rout in November when trade volumes failed to sink along with the quickly depreciating broader cryptocurrency market. As can be seen below, the divergence between trading volume is evident for not only bitcoin, but other top-ranked cryptocurrencies like the fourth-largest in the world by market cap, litecoin (LTC).    Just before the plunge to $3,000, bitcoin was priced at $6,385 on Nov. 10 when it accumulated $3.70 billion in 24-hour exchange volume, according to data from Coinmarketcap. Today, however, bitcoin’s price is nearly half of what it was in November, yet its trading volume is just above $11 billion, which is 200 percent more than the trading volume seen on Nov. 10 and a value last commonly observed in April 2018. Coinmarketcap data further reveals the most exchange volume the world’s largest cryptocurrency ever saw in a single day was $23.84 billion when bitcoin’s price was $17,429.50 on Jan. 05, 2018.    Litecoin’s exchange volume is following a similar trajectory as bitcoin’s exchange volume. As can be seen above, exchange volume began to deviate from litecoin’s price trend around November once again, when the cryptocurrency was trading in the $50 dollar range and exchange volume figures spanned from roughly $300 million to just over $600 million, according to data from Coinmetrics. Litecoin’s is now trading at $58 and its 24-hour exchange volume registers $1.79 billion – again, more than double the values frequently observed before the cryptocurrency plunged below $30 in November. The slight difference between litecoin and bitcoin’s trading volume and price relationship is that litecoin’s price has increased over 100 percent since its December low along with the rise in exchange volume, while bitcoin has seen a more seldom 20 percent increase from its low.

1," Bitcoin’s current period of price consolidation may end with a bull breakout, price-volume analysis indicates. While the cryptomarket leader is lacking a clear directional bias for the tenth straight day, 24-hour trading volume remains elevated near the 10-month high of $10.75 billion seen on Feb. 24, contradicting the popular theory that investor interest drops in a rangebound market. As a result, the pullback from recent highs near $4,200 appears likely to be nothing more than a bull breather and BTC could soon draw bids. Validating that argument is the fact that the recovery rally from the lows near $3,400 seen on Feb. 8 was backed by high volumes. Daily trading levels jumped above their 50-day moving average 35 days ago and have remained above the key metric ever since – a feat last observed during the height of the bull market in the third quarter of 2017, according to CoinMarketCap data. Hence, the probability of BTC ending the ongoing consolidation with a strong move to the downside is quite low. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,930, representing a 0.5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinMarketCap. Twenty-four-hour trading volume is seen at $10.62 billion, while the 50-day moving average of daily trading volume is seen at $7.615 billion.  As seen above, BTC jumped 7.5 percent on Feb. 8 (arrow), invalidating the immediate bearish setup. The strong move was backed by a hike in trading volumes above their 50-day MA. Since then, volume bars have consistently printed above the key average, validating the corrective rally from $3,400. The setup looks even more bullish if we take into account the higher lows and higher highs on volume chart. Recent price pullbacks were accompanied by a drop in volumes (lack of bear support), explaining the weak follow-through to the rising channel breakdown witnessed on Feb. 24. The failed breakdown coupled with elevated volumes amid price consolidation indicates scope for a re-test of $4,208 (Feb. 24 high). That said, the long period of consolidation could test the bulls’ resolve, and a brief drop below the immediate support of $3,865 (March 12 low) could be seen before a continuation of the rally.

1," At the Token2049 event in Hong Kong, which ended today, things were far from boring: Estonian crypto exchange DX.Exchange has announced their own security token, while other panelists were looking for the Bitcoin bottom, and the team behind smart contract platform Tron has reportedly sent someone in an avocado costume to troll Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of competing platform Ethereum. Estonia-based digital asset marketplace DX.Exchange announced at the conference that it will begin to list security tokens starting today, March 14th, along with launching their own token, dubbed In Good We Trust (IGWT). The token’s purpose is to showcase the new security token service and help raise funds for the company, which will be restructured into a new entity called DXtech Exchange. They have also announced that 18 million IGWT tokens will be sold in a private sale, with 10% of the exchange’s profits to be regularly distributed to the token holders. There will be no minimum investment amount. DX.Exchange’s CEO and co-founder Daniel Skowronski said at his panel, titled “STOs and Security Tokens - The Future of Crypto is Closer than we Think” that the move would “mark a further step towards realizing its vision of tokenizing the world and opening the doors to a new crypto economy.” He went on to add, “We believe that all assets whether its securities, art or real-estate will be tokenized. This tokenization has many benefits but the strongest is the ability to help create wealth for people all over the world no matter their social economic situation. At DX, we can help trade the untradeable.” A panel, titled “Crypto Analysts: When Moon?” called out new bottoms - reportedly as low as USD 1,300 for Bitcoin.  According to tweets from the event, popular cryptocurrency analyst Murad Mahmudov and Arjun Balaji, an independent blockchain researcher, see the Bitcoin bottom in the USD 2,000 - USD 2,500 range by the end of summer 2019, while another crypto analyst and trader Tone Vays is the one to go as low as USD 1,300. However, at least Mahmudov and Balaji are reportedly more optimistic about 2020.  Bitcoin is one thing, but the panelists do not hold much love for Ethereum, having unanimously indicated that they consider ETH’s current price of around USD 130 to be overpriced. #Crypto Price #Predictions- #bitcoin @ToneVays: Can hit USD1.3K in 2019  @MustStopMurad & @arjunblj: Can hit USD2K-2.5K by end of summer 2019. Both are bullish in 2020. #Ethereum is overpriced & is going through a transition as they rebuild it for future #scalability #Token2049 pic.twitter.com/KHpEm56ouo Global investment app Abra announced at the event that it has expanded support for the Ethereum platform by integrating the platform’s native coin, ETH. Users are now able to deposit, invest, and withdraw ether directly from the Abra app. Interestingly, ETH was previously available on Abra as a synthetic asset, meaning that users had exposure to the price movements of ether and could only make deposits into the Abra app via a US-based bank account, American Express card, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin. Now, users can directly deposit and withdraw ETH via any Ethereum wallet. “By adding native ether support, Abra users will now be able to easily buy and move ether from other wallets to the Abra app,” said Bill Barhydt, CEO and founder of Abra. “This also opens up the potential to use ETH as an on-ramp to invest in the other assets listed on Abra.” The avocado issue started on Twitter, between Tron CEO Justin Sun and Buterin. After Tron acquired BitTorrent,  a file sharing protocol with the community of over 100 million users, and launched the BitTorrent token, Sun dug out an interview from 2017 where Buterin praises BitTorrent. The latter was quick to correct the assumption that he is indirectly endorsing Tron: “That interview was from Aug 2017. Tron acquired BitTorrent in July 2018. My praise for BitTorrent had nothing to do with Tron. This is like implying that because I like avocados, I approve of everyone who has ever bought an avocado.” Now, the Tron community got stuck on the avocado comment. Tone Vays posted a video showing someone in a smiling avocado suit with the Tron and BitTorrent logos on it taking pics with attendees, writing, “Documenting for Future: [Justin Sun] & [Tron] team r [sic] headed to troll Vitalik Buterin at Ethereum Speach [sic] Token2049 [with] avocado (I can tell u [sic] why but will be the fun in that 😂).

1," Crypto.com Chain (CRO), a cryptocurrency developed as a payment solution for merchants by Hong Kong-headquartered payments and cryptocurrency platform company Crypto.com, has seen a dramatic surge in recent days, having increased roughly 400% in just the last week alone.  At the time of writing (UTC 11:30 AM), Crypto.com Chain is ranked as the 25th by market capitalization (USD 244 million) on CoinMarketCap’s ranking. A month ago, it was 81st.  The extremely fast price surge has not gone unnoticed in the cryptoverse, and many are now asking what exactly is going on with Crypto.com Chain. CRO price chart: Although the coin’s history only goes back to late 2018, it has seen huge increases in its price before, with the first pump happening back in December when the coin more than doubled in price over the course of just a few days. In March, the company announces that CRO-powered Crypto.com Pay went live and first transactions were processed at shop.crypto.com that offers branded clothing.
___ Crypto.com Pay demo on the Crypto.com shop __ Also, Crypto.com Pay SDK (software development kit) is now available ""for selected merchant partners to begin their integration process."" “The Crypto.com Pay SDK has shipped and we will open the platform to our 400,000 users next week. The CRO token serves as a cross-currency settlement instrument for our native blockchain. Further listings of the token will increase liquidity necessary to support transaction volumes and settlement for our growing list of merchants,” Kris Marszalek, Co-Founder and CEO of Crypto.com said on March 8. The most recent price increase, have also followed major exchange listings, including a listing on US-based exchange Bittrex that was announced on March 8. Further, Crypto.com on March 12 announced that their coin would be listed on the Indonesian fiat-to-crypto exchange Indodax, where local traders would be able to trade the token against Indonesian Rupiah. In addition to the Indonesian exchange listing, Crypto.com also announced that they had entered into a partnership with an Indonesian dropship e-commerce company known as Yoshugi Media Group. According to the announcement, Crypto.com’s payment service – Crypto.com Pay – will be used to “cut the exchange rate on fund transfers, reduce the processing fees, and speed up the payment proceeds and flow.” Crypto.com, which has offices in Hong Kong and Bulgaria, is also currently on a hiring spree like few others in the crypto space. As can be seen from job postings on its website, the company is currently looking to fill roles for everything from quantitative analysts, to traders, marketers, and developers."
1," In the past few sessions, bitcoin mostly traded in a tight range below the USD 3,900 resistance level. BTC is stuck between USD 3,850 and USD 3,900 and it seems like it is preparing for the next key break. Ethereum price is slowly moving down after it failed to break the USD 135 resistance level. ETH declined below USD 132 and it could test the USD 130 support. On the other hand, ripple price spiked above the USD 0.320 resistance, but it failed to hold gains and retested the USD 0.310 support area.  Total market capitalization  There was another attempt by bitcoin price  to clear the USD 3,900 resistance, but buyers failed to gain momentum. BTC retreated a few points, but it remained in a tight range above the USD 3,850 support and below the USD 3,900 resistance. It seems like the price is all set for the next break, which could be either above USD 3,900 or towards USD 3,800 and 3,720.
Once there is an upside break above USD 3,900, buyers are likely to take control. The next key resistance is near the USD 3,980 - USD 4,000 zone, where sellers might put up a strong fight. Ethereum price  started following a slow and steady bearish path after it failed to break the USD 135 resistance. ETH is approaching (UTC 08:10 AM) the USD 130 support, which could play an important role in the near term.
If buyers fail to defend the USD 1303 support, the price may decline sharply. On the other hand, the price could bounce back and even make an attempt to surpass the USD 134 and USD 135 resistance levels. Bitcoin cash price  is slowly moving higher and it recently broke the USD 130 resistance level. BCH/USD is showing a few positive signs and it seems like buyers could push the price above the USD 132 resistance level.
EOS  is currently consolidating above the USD 3.50 support level. To start a fresh upward move, the price must clear the USD 3.60 and USD 3.70 resistance levels. On the downside, the USD 3.50 support is very important, below which there could be heavy losses.
Ripple price  rallied recently above the USD 0.315 and USD 0.320 resistance levels. However, XRP/USD fails to hold gains and declined sharply to revisit the USD 0.310 support level. The price may consolidate for a few hours before a fresh upward move. Despite range moves in bitcoin, a few small cap altcoins gained traction and moved up by more than 7%, including ETN, WAX, REPO, ETN, BCD, INB, PIVX, XLM and KCS. Out of these, ETN rallied more than 20% and WAX is up close to 18%. Overall, bitcoin price is trading near a crucial inflection point and is likely preparing for the next key break. BTC could either clear the USD 3,900 hurdle and rally strongly or decline sharply below the USD 3,800 support level.

1," Bitcoin’s struggle for direction continues amid growing signs of a bull reversal in alternative cryptocurrencies. The leading cryptocurrency by market value is trapped in the range of $3,800 to $3,900 for a ninth straight day, contradicting the quick move toward the recent high of $4,190 suggested by the long-tailed doji candle created on Feb. 27. The immediate outlook, therefore, is neutral. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is flatlined at $3,847 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.10 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. Further, BTC is reporting a meager 4 percent gain on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, as opposed to stellar gains in few altcoins. For instance, litecoin, the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently up 83.9 percent on a YTD basis. Binance coin (BNB) and holochain (HOT) are up at least 140 percent each, while EOS (EOS) and ontology (ONT) have gained 40 percent and 69 percent, respectively, according to OnChainFX. Meanwhile, both the BTC and USD pairs of LTC, BNB, Tron (TRX) and Maker (MKR) have found acceptance above their respective 200-day moving average (MA) – a widely followed barometer of bull/bear markets. As a result, speculation that the altcoin market has entered the bull market is gathering steam. However, while few alternative cryptocurrencies seem to have witnessed a bull reversal, the altcoin market as a whole is yet to violate the bearish trend, as seen in the chart below.  On the weekly chart, the altcoin market capitalization (market cap) printed a higher low near $45 billion in early February, signaling bearish exhaustion. However, the trendline connecting January 2018 and April 2018 highs is still intact. A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $64.28 billion (trendline resistance) could be considered an early sign of longer-term bullish reversal. A bearish-to-bullish trend change, however, would be confirmed, if and when, the market cap jumps above $68.61 billion – a bearish lower high created on Dec. 24.  The week-long price consolidation in the range of $3,800-$3,900 seen in the above chart has weakened the bullish case put forward by the long-tailed doji candle created on Feb. 27. As a result, the 100-day MA support at $3,670 could again come into play. On the higher side, a UTC close above $3,950 is needed to revive the short-term bullish outlook.

0," The European Central Bank (ECB), the central bank for the Eurozone, is unwittingly boosting the case for cryptocurrency adoption, the community believes - and that’s exactly the last thing they want to be doing. This comes after they said they could always create money, and the crypto community was quick to reply with accusations of scamming. The bank had started a Twitter thread under the hashtag #AskECB, and Twitter user @Gianluca844 took the chance to ask, “Where did you get the money for the [quantitative easing]?” The bank replied:  Praet: As a central bank, we can create money to buy assets #AskECB https://t.co/zTQuU4y1ch The quote was attributed to Peter Praet, executive board member and chief economist of the ECB.  Quantitative easing (QE), also known as large-scale asset purchases, is an expansionary monetary policy whereby a central bank, which is the ECB in this case, buys predetermined amounts of government bonds or other financial assets in order to stimulate the economy and increase liquidity.  This operation started in 2015 and was finished by the end of 2018, during which the ECB has spent EUR 2.6 trillion (USD 3 trillion), buying up mostly government but also corporate debt, asset-backed securities and covered bonds, at a pace of EUR 1.3 million a minute, according to Reuters. That equates to roughly 7,600 euros (BTC 2.23) for every person in the currency bloc. The cryptocurrency community took issue with the reply, with many tweeting gifs of the Bitconnect Ponzi scheme, which has since its downfall become synonymous with shady doings. “Central banks are marketing bitcoin better than we can,” replied Twitter user @zackvoell, while user @wiz has more to say: “The world is now opening their eyes to your scam of robbing people of their purchasing power by endlessly printing bank notes on worthless paper. The global economy will implement a new Bitcoin standard to opt-out of your scam and prevent further theft by central banks.” ""As a reminder, when central banks and governments decide to simply print more money, they are stealing wealth from majority of the population and enriching the elites. According to the [International Monetary Fund], inflation is one of the leading causes of income inequality in the world,"" Anthony Pompliano, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, a digital asset management firm, wrote in his newsletter.  He went further to explain that ""inflation leads to rising prices for real assets (real estate, etc), which are owned by the elites generally."" ""Central banks may be able to print more fiat dollars, but eventually the Ponzi scheme will end. When it does, Bitcoin will be there, as scarce as ever, with the inability for anyone to print more,"" the famous Bitcoin bull concluded.  An interesting point was raised by user @spiroseliot, who tweeted a picture of a street, supposedly in Venezuela, filled with paper money that was rendered worthless due to the country’s recent hyperinflation. the real value of paper-fiat money... pic.twitter.com/hLyWWJDfBg One of the main points that Bitcoin proponents raise as an advantage over central bank policies is the fact that Bitcoin is capped at 21 million units, which means that in times of shortage, it cannot be printed, which prevents inflation. However, due to the laws of supply and demand, the price of individual bitcoins would rise. Additionally, due to its decentralized and mathematically specified nature, the asset cannot be controlled by any given entity.  On the other hand, the QE was launched as a way to prevent sub-zero inflation from further hitting an economy still reeling from the euro zone debt crisis in March 2015. While it did lift economic growth, helping the rise of wages and lending while keeping inflation subdued, the ECB has also been criticized because the bond buying has depressed interest rates and hurt European banks’ profitability. Meanwhile, the Basel Committee, the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks, stressed that ""crypto-assets"" [that] are at times referred to as ""crypto-currencies"", do not reliably provide the standard functions of money and are unsafe to rely on as a medium of exchange or store of value.  ""Crypto-assets are not legal tender, and are not backed by any government or public authority,"" the Committee said in an announcement today.  ""They present a number of risks for banks, including liquidity risk; credit risk; market risk; operational risk (including fraud and cyber risks); money laundering and terrorist financing risk; and legal and reputation risks,"" it added.

0," After a short term downside correction, bitcoin price rebounded above USD 3,830 and USD 3,850. BTC even climbed above USD 3,880, but it struggled to gain momentum above the USD 3,900 resistance level. It is currently consolidating below USD 3,900 and it seems like buyers are sighting an upside break in the near term. Ethereum remained well below the USD 135 resistance and it is currently (UTC 08:00 AM) testing the key USD 132 support. Ripple price climbed higher and settled above USD 0.310, with a positive angle. Total market capitalization  There were mostly range moves in bitcoin price  above the USD 3,830 and USD 3,850 support levels in the past two sessions. BTC made an attempt to climb above USD 3,900, but it failed. Having said that, the price action suggests that there are high chances of more gains above USD 3,900 and USD 3,920 in the short term.
On the other hand, if there is a downside reaction, the USD 3,850 level may act as a support. Any further declines could take the price towards the key USD 3,800 support level. Ethereum price  struggled to break the USD 135 resistance and declined recently towards the USD 132 support. If there are more losses, ETH could revisit the key USD 130 support level in the next few hours.
On the upside, the USD 134 and USD 135 levels are important hurdles. Should there be an upside break above USD 135, the price will most likely climb above the USD 140 resistance level. Bitcoin cash price  settled below the USD 130 support and it is currently consolidating near the USD 128 level. If BCH/USD needs to climb higher, it must break the USD 130 and USD 132 resistance levels. If not, it may revisit the USD 125 support.
EOS  struggled to clear the USD 3.70 resistance and corrected lower. However, the USD 3.60 level is acting as a support and it seems like the price may trade higher towards the USD 3.70 and USD 3.75 levels.
Ripple price  is slowly moving higher and it is currently placed above the USD 0.310 support. XRP/USD must break the USD 0.312 resistance level to stage a rebound towards the USD 0.314 and USD 0.315 resistance levels. On the downside, the USD 0.310 and USD 0.305 levels are decent supports. In the past few hours, many small cap altcoins rallied more than 10%, including CRO, XZC, MXM, KMD, BCD, VET, ENJ, KCS, AION, ETN, DGB, BCN, DASH and QASH. Out of these, CRO rallied more than 40% and XZC is up close to 34%. Overall, bitcoin price is trading with a positive angle above the USD 3,850 level. However, BTC buyers need to gain traction above USD 3,900 and USD 3,920 to set the stage for a solid upward move towards USD 4,000 and USD 4,040 in the coming sessions.

0," Bitcoin is trapped in a key trading range defined by the 200-week simple moving average and the 200- week exponential moving average, currently at $3,404 and $4,106, respectively The cryptocurrency needs a break above the upper edge needed to confirm a longer-term bull reversal. Conversely, a move below the lower bound of the range could revive the bear market. Prices fell below the 200-week EMA in the third week of November, bolstering the bearish view put forward by the high-volume breach of the crucial support at $6,000 on Nov. 14. The ensuing sell-off, however, ran out of steam in mid-December with prices bouncing up from the SMA, then located near $3,100. Notably, that average has served as strong support at least three times in the last three months. So far, however, seller exhaustion has failed to produce strong buying pressure, as is evident from bitcoin’s repeated failure to break above the EMA over the last 13 weeks. With prices stuck between key MAs, bitcoin’s immediate outlook as per the weekly chart is neutral. The crypto market leader is currently trading at $3,850 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.4 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  On the weekly chart, BTC witnessed corrective rally after defending the 200-week SMA support in mid-December and early February. However, on both occasions, the bounce failed to secure a close above the 200-week EMA. With several weekly indicators now reporting early signs of bull reversal, the probability of bitcoin confirming a bearish-to-bullish trend change with a weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above the 200-week EMA at $4,106 appears high. That could pave way for a bullish higher high above $4,236 (Dec. 24 high) and a rally toward $5,000.  The odds of BTC challenging the lower edge of the trading range would rise if prices find acceptance below $3,658, invalidating the bullish long-tailed doji candle created on Feb. 27. A weekly close below the 200-week SMA at $3,404 could yield a sell-off to levels below $3,000. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

0," Several well-known cryptocurrencies are trading above their 200-day moving averages, a development typically considered a sign of a healthy market. A moving average (MA) is simply an ongoing calculation of the closing prices of an asset over a specified period of time, but is also a tool traders use to gauge the asset’s trend direction as well as support and resistance levels.  While a moving average of any length can be used, the 200-day moving average is a standard in financial analysis. Put simply, an asset trading above the 200-day MA is considered bullish (likely to move higher), while one trading below it is considered bearish (likely to move lower).  Since the long-time market leader bitcoin is not currently trading above its 200-day moving average, one could be forgiven for assuming all other cryptocurrencies are following its footsteps.  However, that is not the case.  !function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"")}})}();
Of the top 20 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization as per CoinMarketCap, both the BTC and USD pairs of litecoin (LTC), binance coin (BNB), Tron (TRX) and Maker (MKR) are currently trading above their respective 200-day moving averages. Both pairs trading above the moving average indicates the markets for LTC, BNB, TRX, and MKR are much stronger than those with acceptance above just one trading pair moving average or those with acceptance above neither – most of which fall under the latter category. Indeed, the four cryptocurrencies have the most bullish markets, but as can be seen above, their performance is not yet the norm. Twelve of the top 20 cryptocurrencies have neither their BTC or USD trading pairs above the 200-day MA, and as the data below shows, several are still very far away. !function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"")}})}(); Of the remaining top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap that are not trading above their USD-denominated 200-day MA, bitcoin cash (BCH) is by a large margin the farthest away from achieving a healthy market while EOS is the closest. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the price of BCH/USD would need to increase 124 percent in order to reach its 200-day moving average while EOS/USD would need to increase just 8 percent. It’s worth noting Bitcoin Cash underwent a hard fork in November resulting in the creation of two new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Cash ABC and Bitcoin SV. Bitcoin Cash ABC retained the BCH/USD ticker on most exchanges so its longtime price history may not be the best reflection of the current state of the Bitcoin Cash ABC market, given the fork has existed less than 200 days. While it does express a weak market, an asset trading excessively far below its 200-day moving average is not always a negative indication. It can also be a sign of extreme oversold market conditions, similar to how the Mayer Multiple is used to gauge bitcoin’s market conditions based on its relation to the 200-day MA. With that in mind, the assets that are farthest from their respect 200-day moving averages like bitcoin cash and Zcash, which needs to increase 71 percent to reach its 200 day MA, could be seen as the most overdue for a positive correction.

1," Blockchain technology firm Blockstream has announced that their satellite message API (an application programming interface) Beta is now on the mainnet. Now, sending data through space using a satellite and paying for it with bitcoins is easier than ever - but what possibilities does this offer, exactly? Blockstream aims to solve blockchain’s dependence on the internet by replacing it with satellites. Initially launched in August 2017, the satellite was first available to users from Africa, Europe and the Americas, with the goal to let users access Bitcoin without the need for an internet connection. In December 2018, the company announced their coverage of the Asia-Pacific region, as well as adding support for Lightning Network payments.  According to the company, the Blockstream Satellite network broadcasts the Bitcoin blockchain around the world 24/7, protecting against network interruptions and providing anyone in the world with the opportunity to use Bitcoin.  Moreover, the satellite message API lets users send encrypted messages to each other from some of the remotest regions on Earth and pay for those message in bitcoin using the Lightning Network service. Back in December, the company’s chief strategy officer, Samson Mow, told Forbes, “Bitcoin has always been about uncensorable money, and now we have uncensorable communications as well.” Now, for those wondering, “What am I supposed to do with this?” we simply say, “Human ingenuity knows no bounds.” You may decide to use this service to send messages and pay for it with bitcoins, but where’s the fun in that? For example, online publication Vice Motherboard has already used the service to send the Communist Manifesto up to space and back to Earth again, where anyone with the right software and dish setup could receive it. “I sent the passage—the part that says, ‘The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains’—to space, and then back down to Earth, using Bitcoin. My reasoning for doing this was… Well, why the hell not? We live in a world where this is possible, my friends,” writes author Jordan Pearson, without explaining his choice of the Communist Manifesto (it is estimated that communist regimes around the world have killed almost 100 million people.) Blockstream community manager Dan Williams told Vice about his own favorite message. “The most fascinating message I’ve received was what appeared to be a journal from an anonymous developer in eastern Europe who shared his growing interest in Bitcoin and the technology surrounding it such as Blockstream Satellite and the Lightning Network,” he explained. The message itself is even better than it sounds. “So here I am, left my job, I have some money to keep me up and I’m building my first raspberry pi lightning node, and broadcasting messages from satellites. Still feels surreal at times,” part of the diary reads. #SatelliteAPI prose. 💯 🛰️⚡️👽 pic.twitter.com/oePSMVKojO Then, there are poems, and - of course - memes, except now they’re in encrypted form, like the so-called Rare Pepe. However, all of these were sent over the testnet, which made them free; with the mainnet now live, you will have to pay for the service. “I suspect given low message fees, it's easier  and simpler to pay with real BTC because it's actually hard to get Test BTC,” explained Blockstream co-founder and CEO Adam Back. And if you really have a message that you need to broadcast through space, is any fee too high?

1," Yesterday, we discussed a possible decline in bitcoin below the USD 3,900 and USD 3,850 supports. The BTC/USD pair did correct lower recently and traded below the USD 3,850 level. It traded towards the USD 3,825 support and later rebounded above USD 3,850. Similarly, there was a downside extension in ethereum price below the USD 132 support before ETH buyers appeared near the USD 130 level. Ripple price declined below the USD 0.310 support and tested the next key support at USD 0.306. The current price action (UTC 08:30 AM) is slightly bearish, but BTC and altcoins are trading near key supports, which may result in a decent recovery in the near term. Total market capitalization  There was a downside break below the USD 3,850 support in bitcoin price . However, there was no test of the USD 3,800 support and declines were contained near the USD 3,825 level. BTC/USD rebounded above USD 3,850, but it is facing a lot of hurdles near the USD 3,900 level.
If there is an upside break above USD 3,900, the price could revisit the USD 3,980 - USD 4,000 resistance area. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,825, below which the price could test the USD 3,800 support level in the near term. Ethereum price  declined below the USD 135 and USD 132 support levels. ETH/USD tested the USD 130 support and it is currently correcting above USD 132. An immediate resistance is at USD 135, followed by the USD 136 pivot level.
On the downside, the USD 132 level is an initial support. If there are more losses, sellers may attempt to clear the USD 130 support. Having said that, if ETH stays above USD 130, it could slowly climb above USD 135. Bitcoin cash price  declined below the USD 128 support and tested the USD 126 support. BCH/USD is currently consolidating losses and it seems like it could correct higher towards the USD 130 or USD 132 resistance.
EOS  tested the key USD 3.50 support level and bounced back. The price broke the USD 3.55 and USD 3.60 resistance levels. The next resistance is at USD 3.70, above which the price could move into a positive zone in the coming sessions.
Ripple price  extended losses below the USD 0.310 and USD 0.308 support levels. XRP/USD tested the USD 0.306 support level and later corrected above USD 0.308. If it clears the USD 0.310 and USD 0.312 resistances, buyers are likely to gain control. In the past two sessions, a few small cap altcoins gained a strong bullish momentum and rallied sharply, including GRS, CRO, R, GNT, QBIT, ARK, POWR and LOOM. Out of these, GRS rallied more than 140% and CRO is up close to 135%. To sum up, bitcoin traded close to the key USD 3,800 support and bounced back. However, BTC must move above the USD 3,900 resistance to climb back in a positive zone. Likewise, ethereum needs to surpass the USD 135 resistance to start a fresh upward move.

1," A widely-followed bitcoin (BTC) price indicator is about to turn bullish for the first time in seven months. Bitcoin’s 50-day moving average (MA) – currently located at $3,669, according to Bitstamp data – could soon move above the 100-day MA at $3,670. The event would confirm the average’s first bullish crossover since the end of August 2018. However, the bull cross is a lagging indicator, being based on past data, and in this instance is likely more a product of bitcoin’s recovery rally from lows near $3,100 seen in December. That said, with several key indicators, like the weekly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and the money flow index flashing early signs of bullish reversal, the probability of the cross trapping the bulls on the wrong side of the market seems low. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,860, having clocked a low of $3,791 earlier today.  As seen above, the 50-day MA is taking an upward turn and is about to cross the 100-day MA from below. Further, BTC’s repeated defense of the 100-day MA over the last 12 days has strengthened the bullish case put forward by the long-tailed doji candle created on Feb. 27. As a result, BTC could soon rise toward the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance, currently located just below the bearish lower high of $4,236 printed on Dec. 24. A UTC close higher would confirm a bearish-to-bullish trend change and could yield a rally to $5,000.  On the weekly chart, the 5- and 10-candle MAs produced a bullish crossover two weeks ago. BTC also defended the 10-candle MA in the previous two weeks, reinforcing the bullish reversal signaled by the MA studies. In the near-term, BTC looks likely to challenge the recent high of $4,190.

The price even traded close to the USD 4,000 barrier before starting a downside correction. Ethereum price faced a strong resistance near the USD 140 level on many occasions, resulting in a bearish push below the USD 136 support level. Ripple price also struggled near the USD 0.320 resistance level and XRP declined towards the USD 0.310 support. The current (UTC 08:10 AM) price action suggests a short term bearish wave in the market before it could climb higher. Total market capitalization  Recently, bitcoin price  gained traction towards the USD 4,000 resistance level, where sellers emerged. A high was formed near the USD 3,975 level and recently the price corrected lower. It traded below the USD 3,920 level and it seems like it could continue to move down towards the USD 3,850 support.
The main weekly support is at USD 3,800, below which there is a risk of a downside push towards the USD 3,660 support level. On the upside, BTC buyers may continue to struggle near the USD 4,000 barrier. If there is an upside break, the price could revisit the USD 4,250 level. Ethereum price  made many attempts to clear the USD 140 resistance, but buyers failed to gain strength. As a result, ETH/USD started a downside correction below the USD 138 and USD 136 levels.
The price even broke the USD 135 level and it could extend losses towards the USD 130 weekly support. If there are more losses, the next support is at USD 125. On the upside, the weekly resistance is at USD 140, followed by USD 145. Bitcoin cash  failed to clear the USD 135 weekly resistance and recently declined below the USD 132 and USD 130 support levels. BCH/USD is heading lower and it may test the key USD 125 support level in the near term.
EOS  failed to stay above the USD 3.80 support level and declined recently. The price is down more than 2.5% and it is currently trading well below the USD 3.65 support level. The next stop for sellers could be USD 3.50.
Ripple price  topped near the USD 0.320 level, which is a significant resistance. XRP/USD declined below USD 0.315 and it seems like it could even break the USD 0.310 support. The main weekly support is at USD 0.300. In the past couple of sessions, a few small cap altcoins traded higher and gained more than 8%, including PAI, REPO, MXM, XTZ, WAN, XLM and GXC. Out of these, PAI rallied more than 17% and REPO is up around 16%. To sum up, bitcoin price gained recently, but the current price action suggests a short term bearish correction. BTC/USD could test the USD 3,800 support level before it could rise again. Similarly, ETH could test the USD 130 support and ripple price may revisit the USD 0.300 support.

0," Bitcoin (BTC) needs to climb at least anther $350 to confirm a long-term bullish reversal, technical charts suggest. The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $3,903 – having rallied 24.8 percent from this year’s low of $3,122 seen in December. This positive trend has spurred hopes that the sell-off from the late 2017 record high of $20,000 is over. Validating that argument are a number of long duration technical indicators flashing early signs of bullish reversal. To name a few, the weekly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is at its most bullish for over a year. The money flow index, which takes into account both bitcoin’s price and trading volume, is also trending north, validating the bullish divergence created in December. That said, BTC is yet to invalidate the most basic of all bearish technical indicators – a lower high, lower low.  On the weekly chart, BTC has been charting regular bearish lower price highs and lower price lows since January 2018. These were essentially shallow bounces that ended up recharging the engines for a drop to further lows. The last lower high of $4,236 created on Christmas Day, however, failed to challenge the preceding lower low of $3,122. And since then, BTC has been creating higher lows in the region of $3,300. While the latter is evidence of seller exhaustion, a bullish reversal would only be confirmed if and when BTC prints a higher high above the Christmas Day lower high. Put simply, a break above that level is needed to mark a successful transition from bearish to bullish trend change. So, with bitcoin’s price currently trading at $3,890, that target is still $350 away.  As seen above, the previous bear market ended with bitcoin charting a higher low near $230 in April 2015. The bullish reversal was confirmed in November 2015 when BTC convincingly breached the bearish lower high of $297 carved in March 2015. It’s worth noting the failed breakout above $297, witnessed in July, which was followed by a drop all the way back to $200.

0," After a few bearish moves, bitcoin price found support near the USD 3,550 level. BTC/USD is slowly recovering and it could gain bullish momentum above the USD 3,600 and USD 3,620 levels in the near term. Similarly, ethereum is moving higher and it is currently (UTC 10:00 AM) placed above the USD 120 support. A clear break above USD 125 is needed for a decent upward move. Ripple price is currently flat near the USD 0.3220, but it could make a nice recovery if buyers push the price above USD 0.335. The technical structure is showing a few positive signs, but bitcoin must move past USD 3,650 for a sustained bullish wave.  Total market capitalization  Buyers managed to push bitcoin price  above the USD 3,580 and USD 3,600 resistance levels. BTC/USD is currently consolidating near USD 3,600, with an immediate resistance at USD 3,625, above which the price is likely to test the key USD 3,650 resistance.
To start a decent uptrend, BTC buyers need to push the price above the USD 3,650 resistance. The next major hurdles are near the USD 3,750 and USD 3,800 resistance levels. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,580, followed by the main weekly support at USD 3,550. Ethereum price  stayed above the USD 115 support and it recovered above the USD 118 and USD 120 resistance levels. ETH/USD is currently trading near USD 121 and it seems like it could test the USD 125 resistance in the near term.
On the downside, a bearish break below the USD 120 and USD 118 supports may push the price back in a negative zone for a test of the USD 115 support. Bitcoin cash price  made an attempt to surpass the USD 130 resistance, but buyers failed to gain traction. BCH/USD is currently trading well above the USD 125 support, with a few positive signs on the hourly chart.
EOS  gained more than 2% today and tested the USD 2.50 resistance. Buyers struggled to gain pace above USD 2.50, but the price remains well supported above USD 2.30. 
Ripple price  is trading in a tight range above the USD 0.322 support. On the upside, XRP/USD is facing a tough challenge near the USD 0.335 resistance, above which the price may climb to USD 0.350. During the past few hours, a few small cap altcoins gained more than 8%, including DCN, XIN, XZC and AOA. Out of these, DCN is up more than 15% and XIN gained close to 9%. To sum up, bitcoin could make an attempt to gain momentum above USD 3,620 and USD 3,650 to end the week on a positive note. However, if BTC/USD fails to break the USD 3,650 and USD 3,700 resistances, it could drop back to USD 3,500 and it might also drag ethereum and ripple lower.

0," Coinstar, the company known for its coin-counting machines found in malls and supermarkets, has announced a partnership with bitcoin ATM operator Coinme to enable bitcoin-buying for cash at its kiosks across the US. Coinstar owns more than 20,000 coin-counting machines in nine countries around the world, but bitcoin purchases will only be available at selected kiosks in the US for now. Further, purchases can only be made with US dollar bills, in any amount up to USD 2,500 for each 24-hour period. Coins and foreign currency are not accepted at this time, according to a statement published by Coinstar. Once the money is deposited into the machine, the customer will receive a voucher with a bitcoin redemption code. The customer will then need to go to Coinme’s website to open an account and redeem the bitcoin. “Bitcoin is now accessible at your local grocery store via Coinstar kiosks, and this offering will make it even easier for consumers to participate in this dynamic new economy,” Coinme’s co-founder Neil Bergquist said in a comment. Unfortunately, buying bitcoin for cash remains a fairly expensive option. Although the two companies do not go into detail on this subject, Coinme’s website reveals that there is a 4% fee to use the new service. Compared to the average buying fee at bitcoin ATMs in 2018, however, Coinme’s fee is certainly in the lower end of the spectrum. As Cryptonews.com reported last year, the average buy fee at Bitcoin ATM’s stood at 9.13%, according to Coinatmradar.com. That compares with Coinbase’s 1.49% fee for US users. These fees obviously come on top of the spread, or the difference between the buy and sell price of bitcoin on the exchange that is used. In other words, bitcoin ATMs may have a role in spreading awareness to a new audience, but it certainly doesn’t come cheap. Meanwhile, as reported in November, French fintech company Keplerk made it possible for tobacco shop customers in France to buy bitcoins. The initiative affects 24,000 tobacco shops in the country where bitcoins are offered as vouchers, which can be cashed in via Keplerk’s wallet. The company takes a 7% cut on every transaction as commission fees.

0," Bitcoin’s eight-day stretch of consolidation looks to have weakened the prospects of a drop back to December lows near $3,100. The leading cryptocurrency by market value has been restricted to a narrow range of $3,500 to $3,700 since Jan. 11. That range play is somewhat surprising, as BTC had set the stage for a quick slide toward December lows near $3,100 with a 9 percent drop on Jan. 10 – the biggest single-day decline since Nov. 24. Notably, prices fell to $3,500 that day, erasing the hard-fought gains of the preceding two weeks. Despite the sharp bearish reversal, a convincing break below the psychological support of $3,500 has remained elusive for eight days. That could be considered a sign of sellers unwilling to offer the cryptocurrency so low in the bear market. Put simply, the probability of a drop to December lows has diminished, courtesy of the range bound activity. As a result, range breakout and a re-test of $4,000 could be in the offing. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $3,620 on Bitstamp. 
As seen above, BTC fell sharply on Jan. 10, confirming a bearish doji reversal. The relative strength index (RSI) also fell back into bearish territory below 50.00. Still, the psychological support at $3,500 has held ground.  The descending triangle breakout on the hourly chart could be considered evidence of bear failure at $3,500 resulting in positive price action. More importantly, the triangle breakout has opened the doors to $3,724 – the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. A move above $3,724 would confirm a bearish-to-bullish trend change on the hourly chart and allow a stronger rally to $4,000 (target as per the measured move method).

1," By adding new clients and cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin payment processor BitPay has managed to process USD 1 billion in transactions in 2018, or second year in a row, despite the market drop last year.  The company claims that it has set a new record for transaction fee revenue by adding new customers like Dish Networks, HackerOne, and the State of Ohio. However, it didn't disclose its revenue. Stephen Pair, Co-founder and CEO of BitPay, said that “To process over USD 1 billion for a second year in a row despite Bitcoin’s large price drop shows that Bitcoin is being used to solve real pain points around the world.” Sean Rolland, Head of Product of BitPay, also adds, “Bitcoin has the network effect around the world and we are still extremely bullish on Bitcoin and the Bitcoin ecosystem.”  BitPay’s B2B [business-to-business] business also had a record year as it grew almost 255% from the previous year as law firms, data center providers, and IT vendors signed up to accept Bitcoin, the company stated without providing any financials. The company, which has been in business for more than seven years, has also set a record for reducing payment error rates. The dollar volume lost to cryptocurrency payment errors reportedly dropped from over 8% (in December 2017) to well under 1% of BitPay’s total dollar volume processed. Although the payment processor remains focused on Bitcoin, they have also added support for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), as well as stablecoins like the USD Coin (USDC), Gemini Dollar (GUSD), and Paxos Standard Token (PAX). In other improvements, BitPay also states that they have increased their number of employees by 78% in 2018, bringing it to close to 80 people. They have also raised USD 40 million in a Series B funding round led by investors such as Menlo Ventures, Capital Nine, G Squared and others, which brought the company’s total raised capital to over USD 70 million. As reported by Cryptonews.com, from February to August last year, the amount of bitcoin spent per month through 17 surveyed bitcoin payments processors ranged from around 16,500 to almost 20,000, only falling to around 14,500 in September. However, the number for September can still be revised upwards, as it happened earlier last year.  Also, BitPay has revealed that the average value of a retail purchase made using BTC has increased last year. In 2016, the average amount spent by someone buying something with bitcoin was USD 107.66, while in 2017 the average rose to USD 347.84. In 2018, by contrast, the average climbed to USD 682.23.  You can find data that breaks down spending by the type of purchase here. However, part of the community is still not a fan of BitPay. This is due to several reasons: back in August 2017, BitPay signed the New York Agreement, which wanted to put an end to Bitcoin’s long-lasting scaling debate by increasing the block capacity through activating Segregated Witness (SegWit2x) and then doubling the block size. However, most Bitcoin maximalists refused to sign this, especially as those who agreed had no intention of changing the name of the coin that would inevitably split off the Bitcoin blockchain. For all intents and purposes, the companies behind SegWit2x appeared to be set to claim this coin as the “real” Bitcoin, while the coin that follows the current Bitcoin protocol won’t be. Another problem that users have with BitPay is the matter of addresses. The company uses a special address format, which is incompatible with many wallets and is said to cause users to lose their funds when converting the address to something recognized."
1," Recently, there was a bearish reaction in bitcoin from well above USD 3,650. BTC/USD declined below the USD 3,600 support and tested the key support at USD 3,550. The price must stay above the USD 3,550 support to recover in the near term. If not, there is a risk of a bearish break below USD 3,500 in the coming sessions. Similarly, ethereum price must hold the USD 115 support area, below which sellers could push the price towards USD 100. Ripple price is currently consolidating above USD 0.320, with resistances at USD 0.330 and USD 0.335. The current (UTC 08:20 AM) price action is slightly bearish, but the stated supports could spark a bullish reaction.  Total market capitalization  After testing the USD 3,550 support, bitcoin price  started trading in a range. BTC/USD is currently up around 0.5% to USD 3,575, with an immediate resistance at USD 3,600. A successful break above the USD 3,650 level is needed for a decent upward move towards the USD 3,750 and USD 3,800 resistances.
On the other hand, if buyers fail to gain strength, there could be a sharp bearish reaction below USD 3,550, USD 3,500 and USD 3,480 in the near term. Ethereum price  tested the USD 116 and USD 118 support levels recently and stayed above the USD 115 pivot level. ETH/USD is slowly moving higher, but a break above USD 125 and USD 128 is required to kick start a move towards the USD 140 level.
On the downside, the USD 118 and USD 116 levels are decent supports. However, a break below USD 115 may push the price back in a bearish zone. Bitcoin cash price  is currently consolidating above the USD 120 and USD 122 support levels. An initial resistance is at USD 130, above which there are chances of a solid upward move towards the USD 140 and USD 145 levels.
EOS  is up around 1% and it is trading near the USD 2.40 level. On the upside, the main resistance is at USD 2.50 followed by USD 2.60. 
Ripple price  tested the key USD 0.320 support on a few occasions, but there was no bearish break. XRP/USD is slowly rising towards USD 0.325 and USD 0.330, above which the price may gain strength for a test of USD 0.375. During the past few hours, many small cap altcoins registered solid gains, including REP, LRC, POWR, SNT, STEEM and WAN. Out of these, REP rallied more than 50%, LRC is up close to 30%, and POWR gained around 24%. Overall, bitcoin is trading in a tight range above the key USD 3,550 and USD 3,540 support levels. The next move in BTC/USD could be either towards USD 3,800 or below USD 3,400 in the coming sessions. Ethereum and ripple may trade sideways before the next major move either bearish or bullish.

1," Bitcoin price volatility has crashed in the last 12 months as the bear market killed off the speculative frenzy. Daily volatility, the spread between the price high and price low, stood at $61 yesterday – down a hefty 98 percent from the figure of $3,468 observed on Jan. 16, 2018 – according to CoinMarketCap data. Meanwhile, bitcoin’s price is also down 74 percent year-on-year. Generally, with a sharp drop in price, volatility in dollar terms tends to fall in parallel. Notably, volatility was extremely high in percentage terms 12 months ago. The trading range was 26 percent on Jan. 16, 2018, indicating that the crypto market frenzy was at its peak. Volatility, however, subsided as the year progressed: dropping from $973 in the first quarter to $345, $245 and $195, in the following quarters, respectively. Meanwhile, in percentage terms, average daily volatility fell from 9.14 percent to 3.6 percent over 2018. This year has begun on a much more calm note. Daily volatility has remained largely below $200 and hit a 2.5-month low of $45.17 on Jan. 12. Many consider the slide in volatility a sign of speculative froth leaving the market and the cryptocurrency nearing a bottom. It is worth noting that an extended period of low volatility usually ends up paving way for a big move. Therefore, BTC could soon violate the six-day-long trading range of $3,500 to $3,700. Moreover, a range breakdown looks likely as the long-term technical charts are biased toward the bears. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,585 on Bitstamp.  As seen above, BTC fell 13 percent last week, reinforcing the bearish view put forward by the descending 10-week moving average, currently at $3,919. The outlook remains bearish as long as BTC is held below the 10-week MA.  BTC has created a neutral diamond pattern on the 4-hour chart. The prospects of BTC breaking the $3,700-$3,500 range to the downside would rise significantly if the diamond is breached on the lower side. The relative strength index (RSI) is biased bearish at 41. So, there is plenty scope for a sell-off post-breakdown. Put simply, the prospects of BTC breaching the $3,700-$3,500 range to the downside would rise significantly if the diamond breakdown is confirmed.

1," Yesterday, we saw a short term recovery above the USD 3,600 level in bitcoin. However, BTC/USD failed to retain strength above the USD 3,650 level and later reacted to the downside. The main reason for the recent bearish moves was the postponed Ethereum Constantinople hard fork. ETH/USD dipped more than 6% and traded below the USD 125 support level. Ripple price also trimmed its recent gains and declined below USD 0.325 before buyers appeared near the USD 0.320 level. The current (UTC 08:20 AM) price action is slightly bearish, suggesting range moves in bitcoin and altcoins in the coming sessions. Total market capitalization  There was a rejection pattern formed near the USD 3,670 level and bitcoin price  declined below USD 3,600. BTC/USD even traded below the USD 3,550 level before it found support near USD 3,520. The price is down around 2% and it seems like it may struggle to move above the USD 3,600 and USD 3,650 resistance levels.
On the downside, the USD 3,520 level is a short term support, below which there is a risk of downside break below the USD 3,500 and USD 3,480 support levels in the near term. Ethereum price  made a sharp turn after the Constantinople hard fork was delayed. ETH/USD dipped below the USD 125 and USD 120 support levels. The pair tested the USD 115 support and later corrected a few points. 
The price is currently down around 6% and it is facing a lot of hurdles on the upside near the USD 122 and USD 125 levels. On the downside, the USD 115 level is a strong support followed by USD 112. Bitcoin cash price  failed to break the USD 135 resistance and declined below the USD 130 support. BCH/USD is currently trading near the USD 125 level, with support at USD 122 and USD 120. The main resistances are USD 130 and USD 135.
EOS  is still above the USD 2.25 and USD 2.30 support levels, but it is facing a lot of offers near the USD 2.45 and USD 2.50 levels. 
Ripple price  dipped below the USD 0.330 and USD 0.325 support levels to enter a bearish zone. XRP/USD tested the USD 0.315 support and recovered above USD 0.320. However, it must settle above USD 0.325 and USD 0.330 for a sustained upward move. Despite recent bearish moves in bitcoin and ethereum, a few small cap altcoins gained more than 8%, including AE, WAX, STRAT, POWR and ZIL. Out of these, AE gained more than 22% and WAX is up close to 21%. To sum up, the recent decline in bitcoin price below USD 3,600 shifted the market sentiment. To start a fresh bullish wave, the price must settle above USD 3,600 and USD 3,650. If not, there is a risk of more losses in BTC, ethereum, ripple and other altcoins lower in the near term.

1," Bitcoin (BTC) has reported losses in January for the last four years, and a fifth now looks on the cards. The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell 32 percent, 14.6 percent, 0.10 percent and 26.64 percent in the first month of 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Notably, the odds are stacked in favor of BTC extending the four-year January losing streak this year. BTC fell 13 percent last week, signaling an end of the corrective bounce from the December low of $3,122. The sell-off reinforced the bearish view put forward by the downward sloping 10-week simple moving average. As a result, a drop to $3,122 in the next couple of weeks cannot be ruled out. That said, the probability of BTC beating the trend this month would rise if the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-day moving average (MA), currently at $3,768, is convincingly scaled in the next few days.  A breach there would strengthen the short-term bullish case.  As seen above, BTC’s 32 percent drop in January 2015 marked an end of the four-year January winning streak. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,611 – down 2 percent from the monthly opening price of $3,689.  As seen above, BTC failed to cut through the 21-candle MA earlier this month, strengthening the bearish view put forward by the downward sloping line. Further, the drop to $3,476 (Jan. 13 low) invalidated the bullish trend change signaled by an outside reversal candle on Dec 20. As a result, the path of least resistance looks to be to the downside.  The 21-candle MA on the daily chart acted as strong support on multiple occasions before it was breached on Jan. 10. The bearish pressure would weaken somewhat if prices cross back above the 21-candle MA, currently at $3,768, in the next day or two. That would boost the prospects of BTC closing above the monthly opening price of $3,689 on Jan. 31. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

0," In December, the Bitcoin mining difficulty was forecasted to drop once again, but it actually beat the forecast and increased during both of the last adjustments. This means that the miners are coming back, creating a more competitive environment. However, some players in the mining industry still need to deal with certain challenges. It was previously estimated that the mining difficulty, the adjustment of which was set for end of December 2018, would drop by 8.22%. However, data from major Bitcoin mining pool BTC.com shows that the difficulty on December 31st actually increased by 10.03% at that time, and again two weeks later, at the next adjustment, by 4.72%. Now, the pool estimates that the difficulty will increase by another 4.35% in almost 13 days. 10 recent Bitcoin mining difficulty adjustments: The mining difficulty of Bitcoin is adjusted every two weeks (every 2016 blocks, to be precise) to maintain the normal 10-minute block time. This means that if there are many miners competing amongst themselves and propagating blocks in less than ten minutes, the difficulty of the next puzzle will be increased; if there are few miners and it takes them much longer to find a solution, the difficulty is decreased - both times just enough to keep block times at around 10 minutes. To further add to the proof that miners are turning their rigs back on, the hash rate is also growing: in the past month, it is up from some 36.5k TH/s to around 42k TH/s, an increase of around 13%.  Bitcoin hash rate: _____
Bitcoin price chart: Moreover, small miners are increasing their share in the Bitcoin network, which helps boost decentralization. Unknown miners closed December having solved 22% of the total blocks up from 6% at the start of the year, according to weekly cryptocurrency publication Diar. The Bitcoin network is currently even less likely to experience a 51% attack given the fact the BTC.com controlled pools have lost dominance over the network, instead spreading the mining power over smaller participants. However, Bitcoin mining is expensive business, and not just due to the cost of the hardware rigs required. The amount of electricity spent is often the cause for incredibly high bills - and that’s without governments additionally increasing the cost of electricity spent on mining operations. As of April 1st, power rates for cryptocurrency firms will go up by 15% in Washington. This is scheduled to go up by another 35% in 2020, and another 50% in 2021. Now, according to the Grant County public utility district (PUD), nine cryptocurrency firms have filed suit at the US District Court of Eastern Washington for imposing an “evolving industry” rate that targets mining operations. Things are getting increasingly difficult for some other mining industry companies as well. Meanwhile, Bitmain, the world’s largest mining hardware maker and operator of the two major Bitcoin mining pools, is seeing their share of trouble, too. The company has announced another round of layoffs, after they were rumored to have lost over USD 700 million in Q4 2018. They closed down their Israeli branch and fired all of its employees, which was followed by reports by Chinese media that Bitmain CEOs Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan are set to step down. The new cuts are happening in Amsterdam, Netherlands and Rockdale, Texas - both of which are losing all Bitmain operations located there. Moreover, US-based Bitcoin mining company Giga Watt is finally going out of business after declaring bankruptcy in November 2018, and the company’s token will become worthless, CCN reported. The firm lasted a little over a year, launching with an initial coin offering in September 2017. The reason for this are unpaid power bills, according to the report. As reported by Cryptonews.com, Giga Watt had filed for bankruptcy in Washington in November, still owing creditors nearly USD 7 million."
0," After testing the USD 3,450 level, bitcoin price recovered above USD 3,500 and formed a support base. Later, BTC/USD started an upside correction and traded above the USD 3,600 and USD 3,620 resistance levels. Similarly, ethereum price formed a solid support above USD 115 and bounced back above USD 120 and  USD 125. Ripple price also performed well and managed to settle above the USD 0.325 levels. These are early positive signs, but the market must recover further to overcome selling pressure. If not, there is a risk of bitcoin and altcoins moving back in a bearish zone. Total market capitalization  There was a decent upward move above the USD 3,500 and USD 3,600 resistances in bitcoin price . BTC/USD even traded above the USD 3,650 level, but it failed to hold gains and later started a short term downside correction. An initial support is near the USD 3,600 level, below which the price may retest the USD 3,550 level.
On the upside, the first hurdle for buyers is near the USD 3,680 level, above which the price must settle above USD 3,700 for an acceleration towards the USD 3,800 level. Ethereum price  gained more than 8% recently and moved above the USD 120 and USD 125 resistance levels. ETH/USD tested the USD 130 resistance and it is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) consolidating gains. 
Buyers need to push the price above USD 130 and USD 132 for more gains towards the USD 140 level. On the downside, the USD 125 level is an initial support, below which the price may drop back to USD 120. Bitcoin cash price  found support and recovered above the USD 125 and USD 130 levels. However, BCH/USD seems to be struggling above USD 130 and it could decline once again towards the USD 122 - USD 124 zone. On the flip side, a break above USD 130 - USD 132 could lead the price towards USD 140.
EOS  rallied above the USD 2.20 and USD 2.40 levels. It traded close to the USD 2.50 resistance and later corrected below USD 2.40. The key support is at USD 2.35 and USD 2.32.
Ripple price  gained traction above the USD 0.310 support and jumped above the USD 0.320 and USD 0.325 resistance levels. XRP/USD may continue higher if it surpasses the USD 0.330 resistance level. Many small cap altcoins gained bullish momentum and recovered more than 10%, including REP, QKC, LINK, REPO, STRAT, NPXS, MANA, WAX, MKR, THETA and DCN. Out of these, REP is up around 25% and QKC gained close to 25%. Overall, bitcoin price recovered nicely above USD 3,500 and USD 3,600, but it must extend gains above the USD 3,700 barrier to move into a bullish zone. If BTC/USD fails to hold gains above USD 3,500, it could drag ethereum, ripple and other altcoins lower in the near term.

0," Signs are emerging that the futures market may not be impressed by bitcoin’s recovery from 15-months lows in December – at press time, the cryptocurrency’s spot price is higher than the futures price.  As of writing, the global average or spot price calculated by CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) is currently $3,650 – up 16.9 percent from the low of $3,122 reached on December.  Meanwhile, futures contracts are trading below the spot price. As seen above (CME chart), January futures are reporting a $20 discount (futures price-spot price). Further, contracts expiring in February, March and June are trading at a discount of $30, $40 and $80, respectively.  A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell a something at a future specified price and date, allowing for investors to hedge or speculate on the performance of the underlying asset. Hence, BTC futures trading at a discount to spot price (also known as market inversion) is a clear indication that the participants are still bearish.  Put simply, bitcoin’s price in one month, two months and six months from now is expected to be lower than its current price. So, it could be argued that the bear market is alive and kicking.  The outlook would turn bullish if the futures start trading at a premium to spot price. Moreover, that is a classic trait of the bull market.  That said, an unprecedented rise in premium serves as a warning sign of market nearing a long-term top. For instance, BTC futures were carrying a staggering $2,000 premium over spot price in December 2017. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

0," That bitcoin (BTC) may be closing on a long-term bottom is generally accepted by now. After all, the leading cryptocurrency by market value has dropped by close to 70 percent over the last 13 months. The challenge now is to pick up early signs of a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change, which may be possible with the help of the 10-week simple moving average (SMA). Acting as resistance, that moving average proved a tough nut to crack in the eight weeks to Nov. 14 – the day BTC reentered the bear market with a big drop below $6,000. Further, BTC has charted bearish-lower highs above the 10-week SMA in the last 13 months. Hence, acceptance above that hurdle could be considered a sign that the process of bearish-to-bullish trend change has begun. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,630 on Bitstamp, representing a 2.5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. Meanwhile, the 10-week SMA is located at $3,919. It is worth noting that a full confirmation of a longer-term bullish reversal would be a convincing break above the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $5,400.  As seen above, BTC repeatedly failed to cross the 10-week SMA on a weekly closing basis (Sunday’s, as per UTC) before falling below $6,000 on Nov. 14. Prior to that, BTC did cross the 10-week SMA in the last week of both February and April, the third week of July and in the last week of August. These bullish breakouts, however, were short-lived: BTC fell back below the 10-week SMA in the following two weeks, trapping the bulls on the wrong side of the market (marked by arrows). Put simply, the cryptocurrency has struggled to breach the 10-week SMA throughout the ongoing bear market. As a result, only a sustained break above the 10-week SMA (at least four weekly candles above the average) would imply bullish reversal. The outlook remains bearish as long as prices are trading below the downward sloping 10-week SMA of $3,919.  BTC closed back above $3,566 (Dec. 27 low) yesterday, establishing a sideways channel on the daily chart. With the weekly chart still biased toward the bears, the lower end of the channel, currently at $3,465, could be breached soon. A channel breakdown, if confirmed, would boost the prospects of a drop to the December low of $3,122.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

1," According to a Russian economist with ties to the Kremlin, the superpower is preparing a massive $10 billion USD investment in Bitcoin to replace its US dollar reserves. Russia’s Bitcoin investment is a step to minimize US sanctions on the country. Vladislav Ginko, an economist at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, said the Bitcoin investment was a step taken to avoid US sanctions on Russia. Ginko believes that Russia’s decision to hold Bitcoin as a reserve currency instead of the US dollar is a move being made to “protect [Russia’s] national interests” in light of a possible interruption of “US nominated payments flows for Russian oil and gas.” Russia’s Bitcoin investment is expected to begin in February. Mr. Ginko furthered: “[The] Russian government is about to make a step to start diversifying financial reserves into Bitcoin since Russia [is] forced by US sanctions to dump US Treasury bonds and [take] back US dollars […]These sanctions and the will to adopt modern financial technologies lead Russia to the way of investing its reserves into Bitcoin.” US sanctions have hit the Russian rouble hard. Now the superpower wants to replace some of its US dollar reserves with the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap. >> Are Stablecoins the Future? The Winklevoss Twins Seem to Think So! Recent US sanctions on Russia came after the poisoning of former Russian military officer Sergei Skripal in London. The former Russian military officer was a double agent for the UK’s Intelligent Services. Two active Russian military intelligent officers attacked Sergei and his daughter Yulia, with a nerve agent. Cryptocurrencies are very popular in Russia and even receive approval by the country’s President Vladimir Putin. According to Ginko, the cryptocurrency industry accounts for 8% of Russia’s GDP. The Bitcoin investment is not the only sign of ‘de-dollarisation’ by the country. It has recently bolstered its supply of the euro, Chinese renminbi, and Japanese yen.

1," Bitcoin dropped by more than USD 100 on Sunday, moving below USD 3,550 before recovering to almost USD 3,600 on Monday morning. However, a new research findings suggest volatility might even increase. At the same time, Japanese regulators deny they’re considering approving crypto ETF.  According to the Boston-based crypto analytics provider Flipside Crypto, a large number of bitcoin holders who haven’t touched their coins for more than two and a half years are now starting to move. Speaking with Bloomberg, Flipside Crypto’s head of data science, Eric Stone, said the supply of “active bitcoins” in the market has increased by 40% since the summer of 2018. The trend has now moved so far that around 60% of the entire bitcoin supply is currently being held by wallets that have been active in the last 30 days. According to Stone, the same phenomena also occurred prior to the large price swings in the bitcoin market in 2015 and 2017. As is well-known, that price move brought bitcoin to an all-time high of nearly 20,000 USD in 2017.  He further added that “It’s definitely a big shift [...] There’s more potential than usual for price swings.” The question now is whether that will be up or down. As previously reported, a new triangle-shaped chart pattern may signal lower prices ahead.  Moreover, despite the recent sell-off, New York based research company Delphi Digital confirmed yesterday that their previous forecast that Bitcoin to bottom out in the first quarter of this year still stands.  Bitcoin price chart: Meanwhile, cryptocurrency researcher Willy Woo thinks that bitcoin is still looking for the bottom: To balance out my pessimism, here's a summary to the bull side by @renato_shira. Many of our on-chain indicators suggest the bottom may be near. While I don't concur with this conclusion, I like the analysis, it's a good summary of the bull case.https://t.co/Qp2A5OjebF In separate news, a spokesperson from Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) told News.bitcoin.com, that “there is no such fact that we are considering approving [Bitcoin] ETFs which track crypto-assets at present […] we are not currently considering approving them.” According to the spokesperson, the agency is of the opinion “that there is no need for trading crypto-assets derivatives at financial instruments exchanges where many market participants are able to trade.” The spokesperson was responding to a report by Bloomberg that the FSA is currently gauging industry interest in ETFs tracking digital currencies."
1," After breaching key support on Sunday, emboldened bears could soon push bitcoin (BTC) prices back towards $3,100. Following a drop to a 3.5-week low of $3,476 at 16:00 UTC yesterday, the cryptocurrency closed at $3,516, effectively invalidating the bullish view put forward by the higher low of $3,566 carved out on Dec. 27. That move also added credence to the bearish reversal signaled by the 9 percent price drop witnessed last Thursday. Put simply, the bears have strengthened their control of the market, after the bulls failed to penetrate the head-and-shoulders neckline resistance of $4,130 and build a stronger rally last week. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,530 on Bitstamp, representing a 2 percent drop on a 24-hour basis. As seen above, BTC found acceptance below $3,566 (Dec. 27 low) yesterday, validating the bearish doji reversal confirmed on Jan. 10. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is reporting bearish conditions at 42.00, having breached the ascending trendline last week. Further, the 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are trending south, indicating bearish setup. So, it could be argued that the recovery rally from the December low of $3,122 has only ended up recharging the engines for a fresh sell-off.  BTC’s fall back to $3,500 has invalidated the positive view put forward by the three-day bullish outside-reversal candle of Dec. 20. Moreover, the cryptocurrency’s failure to produce a significant price rally despite the positive divergence of the RSI, confirmed on Dec. 14, indicates that the bearish sentiment is still quite strong.  On the weekly chart, BTC has created a bearish outside-reversal candle (last week’s price action engulfed the previous week’s high and low) signaling a resumption of the primary bearish trend, as represented by the downward sloping 10-week  moving average (MA).  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

1," Bottom calling is one of the most sought-after practices during red markets, as everyone wants to know when the days might become brighter. Despite the recent sell-off, New York based research company Delphi Digital confirmed yesterday that their previous forecast that Bitcoin to bottom out in the first quarter of this year still stands. This time, the company published analysis of bitcoin holders to explain the process by which they concluded this. ""We’ve established that selling pressure from long term holders is significantly tapped, and accumulation has begun,"" the company said in the report.  The process uses UTXO age dynamics to figure out when long term holders will stop the selling pressure. UTXO stands for the unspent output from bitcoin transactions, while the UTXO age indicates the last time bitcoin was moved.   ""Bitcoin's aggregate UTXO age distribution over time provides insight into buying and selling patterns through previous market cycles, along with where we stand now, and what we can likely expect moving forward,"" the researchers explained. Separating HODLers who haven’t moved their funds in over a year from those who haven’t moved it in longer timeframes, they conclude that most of the selling pressure comes from 3 to 5 year hodlers with a caveat: “An important understanding that allows this to work is that a large portion of the coins in the 5 year+ band are lost.” 7/ Based on the points below, we can presume that most selling came from 3-5 Year holders. An important understanding that allows this to work is that a large portion of the coins in the 5 year+ band are lost. Please refer to the full report for an explanation of each assumption. pic.twitter.com/1IXmsJV9gw The company then explains, “Another important takeaway is we can assume these older owners have exhausted much of their selling efforts, evident in the flattening of these older UTXO bands, coupled with the 1 Year UTXO band reaching a floor and staying flat through the first half of 2018.” The graphs point to an accumulation process that is similar to what happened at the end of 2014, implying a bottom in sight.  They further add that there are strong correlations between the current situation and historical figures, especially the end of 2014 and the end of 2018: “With this data, we can estimate the date of these events. A uniformity across both cycles was the slope from the base of the 1 Year+ line to its peak [...] The date and UTXO floor holding rate, which will occur during the next selloff, are the remaining factors that are needed to complete the cycle. It's difficult to be confident in a forecast this far out, but our estimates have the next UTXO floor occurring in Q4 2022.” This new UTXO floor could be the foreshadowing of the next bottom, should the pattern stay consistent. The previous research, published by the company back in December, drew a parallel between 2013 and 2017, as the price’s rise of late 2017 mimics that of 2013, where peak valuations were followed by an extended bear market, characterized by multiple relief rallies on the way to drastically lower prices, but the bottom does not seem to be too far off. Meanwhile, an informal poll in the beginning of last autumn showed that usually very cautious Wall Street investors were calling a bottom in the bitcoin market. Twitter users, however, were more skeptical. As for the current state of the market, CEO of cryptocurrency company Circle, Jeremy Allaire, explained during a recent AMA (Ask Me Anything) session on Reddit: “My general perception is that the markets have been oversold and that some core assets have decoupled from their usage, which suggests they are undervalued. We look at things like hashrate health, on-chain activity, as key indicators of usage and adoption and underlying unit economic support."" As reported by Cryptonews.com, as discouraging as recent market events may be for anyone hoping that Bitcoin will 'go to the Moon,' there are other measures of the cryptocurrency's health, and these reveal that it's doing better than many people currently think."
1," Yesterday, we saw renewed selling pressure on bitcoin below the USD 3,925 and USD 3,900 support. BTC/USD extended losses and broke the USD 3,800, USD 3,700 and USD 3,640 support levels. Similarly, ethereum declined heavily below the USD 140 and USD 132 support levels. ETH/USD is currently (UTC 08:10 AM) trading near USD 125, with a bearish angle. Ripple price also fell sharply and traded below the USD 0.350 and USD 0.335 support levels. The current price action is pretty bearish and it seems like there could be more downsides in BTC and altcoins in the coming sessions. Total market capitalization  Sellers gained control below USD 3,800 and pushed bitcoin price  below the USD 3,700 and USD 3,640 support levels. BTC/USD traded close to the USD 3,540 support and it is currently consolidating losses. An initial resistance is at USD 3,600, above which the price may test the USD 3,640 resistance.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,540 - USD 3,550, below which the price is likely to visit the USD 3,500 support in the near term.  Ethereum price  tumbled and settled below the USD 132 support. ETH/USD even broke the USD 130 and USD 125 support before buyers appeared near the USD 120 - USD 121 zone.
If there is an upside correction, the previous supports at USD 130 and USD 132 are likely to act as hurdles. On the downside, the USD 120 - USD 121 zone is a crucial support, below which the price could decline towards the USD 106 support. Bitcoin cash price  declined heavily and it even broke the USD 140 and USD 132 support levels. BCH/USD is down around 8% and it may soon break the USD 127 support. The next main support is at USD 125, followed by USD 122. On the upside, resistances are aligned at USD 132 and USD 138.
EOS  trimmed most its gains and traded below the USD 2.60 and USD 2.50 support levels. The price is currently trading near USD 2.40 and it may decline towards the USD 2.25 support.
Ripple price  gained bearish momentum after it broke the USD 0.350 support. XRP/USD traded below the USD 0.340 and USD 0.330 supports to move further into a bearish zone. The next crucial supports are USD 0.320 and USD 0.312. Many small cap altcoins declined heavily and are down more than 8%, including R, TRX, AE, REPO, DCN, BCZERO, STRAT, WTC, WAN, ZIL and STEEM. Out of these, R is down around 15% and TRX fell close to 12%. Overall, bitcoin is back in a bearish zone below USD 3,750. If BTC/USD breaks the USD 3,500 support, sellers are likely to push the price towards USD 3,200. Besides, ethereum and ripple could also extend declines if they fail to stay above the USD 120 and USD 0.320 supports respectively. However, some of the top 50 coins in terms of market capitalization are still in positive territory for the week.

1," Bitcoin’s (BTC) price saw its biggest drop for seven weeks on Thursday, weakening the prospects of a bullish breakout above $4,100. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value hit a 3.5-week low of $3,503 yesterday, before closing (as per UTC) at $3,627 – down 9.4 percent on the day. That was the biggest single-day drop since Nov. 24 and the fourth biggest daily loss of the last two months, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Essentially, the hard-fought gains of the last two weeks have been erased in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency had carved out a bullish-higher low near $3,550 on Dec. 27 before crossing $4,000 on Jan. 6. The follow-through to break above $4,000, however, was anything but encouraging. Moreover, signs of bullish exhaustion emerged near the crucial resistance of $4,130 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline) and demoralized bulls started to exit the market yesterday, leading to a sharp drop in prices. As a result, the bears may be feeling emboldened and could attack the crucial support lined up near $3,550. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,630. Bitcoin fell to $3,500 yesterday, confirming a bearish doji reversal on the daily chart. The cryptocurrency also closed below the crucial 50-day moving average (MA) support, Adding credence to the bearish move, trading volumes jumped to the highest level since Dec. 21 and 14-day relative strength index (RSI) breached the ascending trendline to the downside. With the odds stacked in favor of the bears, the immediate support of $3,566 (Dec. 27 low) could be breached soon. That would only bolster the already bearish technical setup.  On the weekly chart, BTC has created a bearish outside reversal candle – this week’s price action has engulfed the previous week’s high and low – having failed to penetrate the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) hurdle for four weeks straight. The candlestick pattern indicates that the week began with optimism, but is approaching a more pessimistic close. As a result, it is widely considered a sign of bearish reversal. Put simply, the doors have been opened for a re-test of the 200-week MA lined up at $3,250. Supporting that bearish case is the downward sloping 10-week MA.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing. Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; Charts by Trading View"
0," According to a US Government SEC registration form, cryptocurrency index fund provider Bitwise Asset Management has applied to launch a new Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) with the government body. An ETF is a platform that tracks and trades an asset in the same way as stocks are traded on an exchange. Will Bitwise manage to succeed where so many others are failing? Bitwise’s proposal is for an ETF that tracks the value of Bitcoin via the Bitwise Bitcoin Total Return Index. This value is “calculated based on the prices of Bitcoin that the Index Provider derives from Bitcoin price transactions occurring on cryptocurrency exchanges.” Basically, the index will take Bitcoin’s value from a variety of crypto exchanges and will, therefore, offer a more accurate and precise market value for the coin. This is one difference that Bitwise’s ETF proposal offers that previous ETF proposals—which have all been rejected—did not. Another difference on offer with Bitwise’s ETF proposal is that it would need “regulated third-party custodians to hold its physical bitcoin.” The company’s Global Head of ETFs, John Hyland, spoke of this in the press release: “Having a regulated bank or trust company hold physical assets of a fund has been the standard under US fund regulation for the last 80 years, and we believe that is now possible with Bitcoin.” >> Ethereum Classic Attack: Gate.io Will Return Most Funds Bitwise is still awaiting a decision from the SEC on a previously filed ETF that would track the Bitwise HOLD 10 Private Index Fund. The approval of a crypto ETF has yet to happen, although the industry has been crying out for one. In December 2018, the SEC postponed its decision on a Bitcoin ETF by investment firm VanEck and blockchain company SolidX. It is now expected to make a decision by the end of February.

0," The most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin may not be completely out of the woods yet, a popular technical analyst warns traders.  Although the sentiment surrounding bitcoin has been boosted by renewed hopes after a gain of almost 30% since the bottom in mid-December, a new triangle-shaped chart pattern may signal lower prices ahead, analyst Jesse Colombo at Clarity Financial, Houston-based registered investment advisor firm, wrote on Tuesday. According to Colombo, bitcoin has just formed another triangle pattern, following the previous big triangle pattern that ended with a breakout to the downside on November 14 last year. The way Colombo sees it, the new chart set-up should be seen as a continuation pattern in the currency bearish trend. The number one cryptocurrency “is likely to make another big move once a breakout occurs,” Colombo wrote in the update, while adding that “bitcoin is still in a confirmed downtrend and a breakdown from this pattern would likely foreshadow the cryptocurrency hitting the low thousands or even under USD 1,000, eventually.” The analyst, who claims correctly predicted the fall below the important USD 6,000 level in October, further wrote: “If bitcoin breaks down from the current triangle, the downtrend will continue as the digital currency further erases its gains made during the 2017 cryptocurrency bubble.” “For now, I am watching which way Bitcoin breaks out from the triangle that is currently forming,” he concluded. Meanwhile, Travis Kling, founder of the crypto hedge fund Ikigai, told Bloomberg that “it’s unlikely that the bottom is in for Bitcoin” as ""the preponderance of evidence leads us to believe that we’ll see more lows before we head higher."" Bloomberg also refers to GTI VERA Bands Indicator, a technical measure, which suggests that Bitcoin is on the brink of a large move. However, it's direction is not clear yet. Also, on Tuesday, DoubleLine Capital CEO Jeffrey Gundlach said that a move to USD 5,000 for bitcoin is possible, CNBC reported. However, he did not specify when it may happen.  “I don’t recommend anything with bitcoin, really… but if you really want to speculate, I think it could make it to USD 5,000. Talk about an easy 25%,” Gundlach was quoted as saying. As reported last week, data from a DailyFX research note showed that 80% of traders with a position in bitcoin are on the long side – meaning they have positioned themselves for higher prices. This is the highest level of optimism among bitcoin traders since November 2018. However, the danger is that these traders will be forced to sell if things do not turn out the way they expected. Today, bitcoin is down by more than 5% in the last 24 hours (UTC 07:26 AM.)  The recent bearish moves in BTC/USD below USD 3,850 are signaling an increase in selling pressure. If sellers remain in action and the price drops below USD 3,720, bitcoin and many altcoins could extend slides in the coming sessions."
0," The price of bitcoin fell more than 10 percent during Thursday’s trading session as the cryptocurrency erased a large portion of its recent gains.  At 6:00 UTC, bitcoin opened the trading hour at a price of $4,018, but fell to $3,748 before the hour was complete. After trading sideways until 16:00 UTC, the sell-off accelerated to a low of $3,570, according to CoinDesk pricing data.  Bitcoin’s current price of $3,610 reflects a $367 difference and more than 9 percent drop from its 24-hour opening price of $3,995, CoinDesk data further reveals.   In the last 24-hours, a total of $6.4 billion of bitcoin was traded across exchanges as its total market capitalization fell roughly 7 percent from $70 billion to $64 billion.  The broader market has accompanied bitcoin in its latest dip as it usually does when bitcoin markets show weakness.  According to Coindesk’s Crypto-Economic Explorer (CEX), 18 of the 19 tracked cryptocurrencies are reporting double-digit 24-hour losses, with several extending depreciation beyond 15 percent including litecoin (LTC), neo (NEO) and cardano (ADA).  Cardano is the worst performers today, currently printing an 18 percent loss. As it stands, the total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market is registering $122 billion, down 10.2 percent on the day according to CoinMarketCap.

0," Bitcoin is losing altitude as an unwinding of bullish bets is creating downward pressure on prices. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,780 on Bitstamp – down 5 percent on a 24-hour basis – having found offers above $4,000 at 06:00 UTC. Notably, the price drop is accompanied by a decline in the bullish bets. For instance, the BTC/USD long positions on the Bitfinex exchange fell to an eight-day low of 31,237 earlier today and are currently down 8 percent at 31,255 – the biggest single-day drop since Dec. 19. Further, the long-short ratio has pulled back to 1.35 from the five-month high of 1.5 reached yesterday, indicating waning bullish sentiment. What’s more interesting is that the “long squeeze” comes after repeated failure on the part of the bulls to clear the key resistance above $4,100. So, it seems safe to say that the demoralized bulls are exiting the market and that could attract sellers.  As seen above, long positions have dropped sharply, while short positions are largely unchanged on the day. That said, today’s sell-off could entice the bears, leading to a rise in shorts and a deeper drop in prices.  The bearish doji reversal – back-to-back doji candles and a negative follow-through – seen in the above chart indicates that the recovery rally from the December low of $3,122 has stalled and the bears have regained some control. Validating that argument is the breakdown of the trendline connecting the Dec. 28 low and Jan. 6 low. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is also rolling over in favor of the bears. Moreover, the failure on the part of the bulls to force an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout could be considered a strong bearish signal, especially since the bull flag breakout, witnessed in the 4-hour chart earlier this week, had set the stage for a break above $4,300. As a result, BTC risks falling to the major support lined up at $3,566 (Dec. 27 low).  With prices trading well below $3,934 (flag low), the bullish view put forward by the bull flag breakout on the 4-hour chart earlier this week is no longer valid.

1," Yesterday, there was a short term downside correction in bitcoin below the USD 3,950 support. Later, BTC/USD recovered and traded above the USD 3,950, USD 3,975 and USD 4,000 levels. However, buyers failed to gain traction and later the price started trading in a range above USD 3,950. Ethereum also recovered a few points and tested the USD 150 resistance, with a bullish angle. Ripple price is slowly grinding higher and it seems like the price may rise towards the USD 0.365 resistance. The current bias is slightly bullish and there are chances of more upsides in bitcoin price above USD 4,000. Total market capitalization  After recovering above the USD 4,000 level bitcoin price  corrected a few points. However, BTC/USD stayed above the USD 3,950 support and it is currently trading in a range. On the upside, an initial resistance is near USD 4,000, above which the price may climb towards the USD 4,050 and USD 4,100 resistance levels.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,950, which will most likely act as a pivot area. A close below USD 3,950 could spark bearish moves towards USD 3,925 and USD 3,880 in the near term. Ethereum price  recovered from the USD 145 support and traded above USD 148. ETH/USD is currently up close to 2% and it seems like it could break the USD 150 and USD 153 resistance levels.
The main resistance is at USD 155, above which the price may climb to USD 160. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 145, followed by USD 142 and USD 140. Bitcoin cash price  is trading flat near the USD 155 level. A proper break above USD 160 is needed for a decent upward move. If BCH/USD fails to gain traction, it could correct lower towards the USD 150 and USD 148 supports.
EOS  seems to facing a solid resistance near the USD 2.80 and USD 2.82 levels, above which the price may perhaps test the USD 3.00 resistance. The main supports are USD 2.72 and USD 2.68.
Ripple price  is slowly moving higher and it recently broke the USD 0.360 resistance. If XRP/USD breaks the USD 0.365 and USD 0.370 resistances, there could be more gains.  During the past few hours, many small cap altcoins gained more than 10%, including HOT, NPXS, LINK, NEO, VET, IOST, ZIL, CRO and AOA. Out of these, HOT rallied more than 24% and NPXS is up around 16%. Clearly, the price action is positive for bitcoin above the USD 3,925 and USD 3,950 support levels. Still, a successful close and follow through above USD 4,000 is must for BTC/USD buyers to gain momentum. Similarly, if ethereum gains strength above USD 155, ETH/USD may rally towards the USD 165 and USD 170 levels.

1," The ratio of long-to-short positions placed on bitcoin (BTC) has reached its highest level in over five months on cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. At press time, the BTC long positions placed on the exchange total 33,750 units, worth $137.3 million at current market prices, whereas the number of short positions is roughly 11,000 units less at just 22,787 – now worth just under $93 million. This creates the long-to-short ratio of nearly 1.5:1 – its highest since August 6th of last year. Bitcoin longs and shorts (Bitfinex)  The drop in short positions is not exactly surprising, considering the price of bitcoin fell roughly 50 percent between Nov. 14 and Dec. 14, giving traders ample time to lock in profits while awaiting further opportunities. A bullish technical reversal pattern known as the “inverse head and shoulders” pattern is also evident on the bitcoin’s price chart, which may be playing another factor in scaring bears out of the market for now. Although the long/short ratio being at multi-month highs may seem encouraging for bitcoin bulls, the market will likely witness another sharp decline if key support near $3,200 is breached, as it would signal the latest corrective bounce to nearly $4,400 has ended. This would put the market at risk of experiencing a “long squeeze” or rapid closure of long positions, which could have a rapid and bearish effect on the price of bitcoin since the only way to terminate a long position is to sell back the longed BTC.

1," With the bitcoin (BTC) market showing signs of indecision, prices could soon retreat back below $4,000. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization witnessed two-way business yesterday before ending largely unchanged on the day (as per UTC) at $3,995 on Bitstamp. Worryingly for the bulls, BTC created a doji candle on Tuesday – widely considered a sign of indecision in the market – even though a bull flag breakout, witnessed yesterday, had seemingly set the stage for a move above $4,300. Notably, the candlestick pattern appeared at the top of the recent recovery rally and near crucial resistance above $4,100, representing bullish exhaustion. The bears, therefore, have an opportunity to make a slight comeback, especially if buyers fail to keep prices above the previous day’s low of $3,934. As of writing, bitcoin is changing hands at $4,010 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.80 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  As seen above, BTC has carved out a doji candle at the confluence of the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) and the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance. The prospects of a bull breakout above $4,130 (neckline + 50-day EMA) would drop sharply if BTC confirms a bearish doji reversal with a UTC close below $3,934. That will likely put the focus back on the long-term bearish technical setup and allow a drop to $3,566 (Dec. 27 low). It is worth noting that a drop towards $3,566 would imply inverse head-and-shoulders failure, which is widely considered a strong bearish signal. Put simply, the bulls need progress soon. A UTC close above $4,130 would confirm an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout and open the doors for a stronger rally.  BTC witnessed a bull flag breakout on the 4-hour chart yesterday, signaling a resumption of the rally from the Jan. 6 low of $3,753. So far, however, a break above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance of $4,130 has remained elusive. That said, the bull flag pattern is still valid and would lose credibility only below the previous day’s low of $3,934. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

1," Christopher Brookins is the founder of Pugilist Ventures, a quantitative crypto fund founded out of Carnegie Mellon. ———————————————————————————————— Since the end of 2018, price action has been demonstrably negative, which surprised many expecting the end of Q4 historical “pump” in prices. The price plummet appears largely driven by negative sentiment and swathes of selling pressure after the 2018 support level of $6,000 finally broke (dashed black line). This selling pressure kept prices well into the oversold range (using RSI and SWTO) for several weeks. Only recently, has price begun to rebound. Even so, RSI and SWTO are still trending downward (black arrows), which may point to further price weakness at the beginning of Q1 2019 while bitcoin searches for a sustainable bottom.  Charts via Tradingview.com As mentioned prior, many market commentators and participants assumed, incorrectly, that Q4 was always a strong period for market price growth, specifically from mid-November to the end of December. However, what many viewed as historically consistent price growth during this period, was in fact historically consistent volatility growth. The graphic below shows historical daily volatility trends of bitcoin on a yearly basis since 2013. Thus, the supposition that many bulls were wrongly betting on was that higher volatility always equates to higher prices.  *Gdax/Coinbase Pro As the volatility chart illustrates, the volatility trends of BTC, since 2013, do follow predictable patterns, culminating in higher volatility during Q4. This dynamic unfolded again in 2018 as price volatility compressed from October to mid-November (black lines), which typically precedes a breakout in price action. However, this time, volatility broke out to the downside for bitcoin. After analyzing the overall trend in 2018 (demonstrably bearish), price volatility compression, historical volatility patterns, and fundamental indicators, it should have been more clear to market participants that the probability of a negative price breakout was far higher than to the upside. Fundamental indicators can be quite useful for ascertaining a “narrative” of price movements and patterns, as long as the narrative is rooted in non-subjective data exploration. However, given the small sample size of bitcoin market cycles (n=10), each indicators output and predictive ability should be taken with a “grain of salt”. Nic Carter from Castle Island Ventures / CoinMetrics and Antoine Le Calvez from Blockchain.info recently pioneered a new concept called realized cap (capitalization). The differentiation between realized cap and market cap being “instead of counting all of the mined coins at equal, current price, the UTXOs are aggregated and assigned a price based on the BTC/USD market price at the time when said UTXOs last moved.” David Puell and Murad Mahmudov do an excellent job explaining these terms and significance further in their article. Using data from CoinMetrics, the significance of realized cap compared to market cap can be visualized quite dramatically, albeit via a small sample size. The crossover points between market cap and realized cap can be viewed almost similar to golden crosses, whereby market cap breaching above realized cap is a re-ignition of a bull cycle, while a cross beneath may indicate the final stretch of a bear cycle. Beyond the aforementioned, this comparison offers lessons which may bear out or “repeat” in 2019. Looking at the graphic, market cap went beneath realized cap on December 28, 2014, and stayed beneath realized cap until October 28, 2015, which coincides with the data-validated, high volatility period for bitcoin. In this case, volatility coincided with price growth for bitcoin and kicked off the start of an amazing two-year bull run for bitcoin. This time around, market cap fell beneath realized cap on November 20, 2018. So, if history repeats itself (which is a tepid assertion), an investor might expect further price declines in 2019 followed by sideways trading, until a reignition of a new bull cycle at the end of Q4 2019 (November to December 2019).  Correlation to Δprice of 0.19 Additionally, using realized cap, an additional ratio or oscillator can be created that further explains bitcoin’s market cycles, market cap to realized cap (MVRM). The MVRM provides a useful indicator that visualizes the above dynamic via one ratio. For example, historically, a value beneath 1.0 is undervalued while a value above 3.0 is overvalued; and above 4.0 is a negative inflection for prices. Currently, MVRM is 0.82 and the all-time low is 0.56. So, despite bitcoin being in undervalued territory, MVRM still possibly has further room to fall, which is consistent with the end of Q4 2019 narrative. Further support of the significance of MVRM for price movements can be seen by the correlation between price and MVRM of 0.19, and correlation between price and MVRM of 0.98, which is extraordinarily high.  *coinmetrics.io This ratio acts as an “equilibrium” gauge of bitcoin’s price to fundamentals valuation, where transaction volume and active addresses both represent “quantity and quality” growth of the bitcoin network; validated by 0.15 and 0.07 correlation between price, respectively. For example, when TAAR and price are closely distributed, price (valuation) and fundamentals are aligned in equilibrium; and when either TAAR or price deviate substantially from each other, price is out of equilibrium which has historically resulted in price devaluation (albeit small sample size). The market’s recent selloff has helped reduce the gap between price and TAAR, which has persisted since Q4 2017.  Correlation to Δprice of 0.13 The 30 day moving average of TAAR is ~$2500 while TAAR daily is ~$2000, thus an “equilibrium” range for price appears between $2,000 and $3,000. *Note: prices seldom mean revert directly to their equilibrium level, they typically over-correct, which makes further price depreciation beyond the stated levels possible. Additionally, as can be seen on the logarithmic chart, price has bounced off TAAR’s 30-day MA twice in 2018 (black boxes), and has most recently rebounded momentarily. The final price flush before finding a stable bottom will likely coincide with price falling beneath the TAAR 30 day MA, price recovering that level, and then TAAR beginning to trend upward once more.  *coinmetrics.io Similar to MVRM, the TAAR to price ratio is an oscillator that visualizes the same dynamic via one ratio. Historically, a ratio of 1.5 and above is undervalued, 1.0 to 2.0 is “safe”, and beneath 1.0 (“equilibrium”) is overvalued. Currently, the oscillator is ~0.70 which still indicates overvaluation, but the overall trend back towards 1.0 is positive.  *coinmetrics.io While the recent price action for bitcoin has been harshly negative, these market clearing events have begun the normalization process for bitcoin’s price valuation, which can be seen in several indicators. Per the MVRM analysis above, if history repeats itself, price will likely fall further, then trade sideways until the end of Q4, then reignite a new bull market. An additional verification of this narrative will be if the TAAR to price oscillator enters undervalued territory above 1.50 in 2019, especially, prior to Q4. *Disclaimer: this article is for educational purposes only and should not be considered investment or trading advice.

1," Bitcoin’s (BTC) minor pullback from two-week highs could end up fueling a breakout above the key hurdle of $4,140. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value jumped to $4,090 at 17:15 UTC on Sunday – the highest level since Dec. 24 – validating the short-term bullish reversal confirmed on Dec. 20. Even so, the positive momentum has weakened slightly in the last 36 hours. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,995 on Bitstamp, having clocked a low of $3,934 earlier today. The 3 percent correction from two-week highs, however, has carved out a bull flag on the technical charts. Put simply, the pattern often represents a pause in a rally and can accelerate the preceding bullish move. So, it seems safe to say that the price pullback has pushed up the odds of an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout above $4,140.  BTC has created a bull flag pattern – a bullish continuation setup – on the 4-hour chart. A 4-hour close above the upper edge of the flag, currently at $4,005, would confirm a bull breakout. That would signal a revival of the rally from the Jan. 6 low of $3,753 and would open the doors to $4,340 (target as per the measured move method). Essentially, the flag breakout could end up yielding an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout above the neckline of $4,140. More importantly, higher lows (marked by red arrows) at $3,566 (Dec. 27 low), $3,629 (Jan. 1 low) and $3,753 (Jan. 6 low) indicate that the bulls are in control. Therefore, crossing the flag resistance should not be a tough task.  As seen above, BTC is taking the support of the 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs), validating the short-term bullish setup indicated by these upward sloping averages. The 14-day relative strength index is holding in bullish territory above 50.00 and prices seem to have found acceptance above the 50-day MA hurdle. The path of least resistance, therefore, is to the higher side. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing. Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"
1," Past performance is no guarantee of future results, but when history repeats it can be difficult to ignore the potential implications. Such is the case with price chart of ether, the ethereum network’s native cryptocurrency. Since Sept. 2018, the price chart of the world’s second largest cryptocurrency has mimicked the market structure of bitcoin’s bear market bottom in 2015.  In the world of technical analysis and trading, similar and repeating market structures are known as fractals, similar to the recurring patterns found in art, nature and mathematics.  The two emotions of fear and greed are what drives price action in a market, so repeated investor behavior yielding similar results may not be that far-fetched, especially when those emotions create fractals in the cryptocurrency market.  The above chart depicts the eerie fractal from BTC’s bottom in 2015 (upper frame) playing out on the ETH/BTC chart (lower frame).  Needless the say, the structure of the two charts are nearly identical, with only minor discrepancies.  As can be seen, going from left to right, both assets printed a “V” shaped bottom followed by a minor rally and subsequent bearish trendline breakdown.  After the trendline break, both markets endured a period of abnormally low volatility compared to their typically erratic nature.  As the old saying in investing goes: “never short a dull market”. These periods are commonly found to be when markets store – or accumulate – energy before a significant advance.  Larger players also tend to lose interest in boring markets, leaving just the smaller retail traders who, in large part, favor long over short positions, in turn creating a market that favors the bulls. Following the dull market, both BTC and ETH produced a minor rally followed by another sell-off, as depicted by the blue downward curved lines.  Both markets quickly rebounded in a curved bottom fashion, driving the price to a “V” shaped top, lastly followed by bullish continuation from the previous rebound.  Indeed, the similarities are striking, but there are differences between the two that may play spoilsport to the fractal actually playing out. According to stock market legend Richard D. Wyckoff, price charts abide by a law of “cause and effect.” In other words, the longer the trend stays sideways A.K.A. “the cause,” the more powerful and long lasting the subsequent trend, A.K.A. “the effect” – another reason shorting a dull market can be risky. This is particularly relevant here since the cause for BTC’s 2015 bottom was nearly an entire year long, whereas ETH’s cause is so far just over three months.  Taking that into account, it could be argued that a long-term uptrend would be an unlikely result if ETH/BTC keeps advancing since its cause is considerably smaller than BTC’s was. A bullish effect is still possible, though – just perhaps one that is more proportional to its 3-month cause.

0," Charlie Lee is at it again. The Litecoin founder isn’t shy when it comes to voicing his opinion on crypto via Twitter and yesterday was no different. It seems this time, he’s targeting Bitcoin maximalists. It all started with a poll. Some self-proclaimed Bitcoin Maximalists are actually Bitcoin Extremists. They think all other coins are scams and will go to zero. Maximalists think Bitcoin is and will remain the dominant cryptocurrency but there is room for altcoins to exist and even do well. What are you? — Charlie Lee [LTC⚡] (@SatoshiLite) January 6, 2019  It seems Mr. Lee isn’t happy with a group of self-proclaimed Bitcoin maximalists. The Litecoin founder goes even as far as calling them “extremists,” which isn’t generally a positive thing to call someone. In 23 hours, Charlie Lee has collected over 28,000 votes on his poll and Bitcoin maximalist has taken over the majority of it. At press time, Bitcoin extremist has 9%, altcoin maximalist has 33%, and nocoiner has 10%. That leaves the remaining 48% to individuals who deem themselves Bitcoin maximalists. Traditionally, maximalists believe that Bitcoin (BTC) is the top cryptocurrency and the one to use day-to-day. Where Lee seems upset is that a group of these maximalists have attacked his own project and feel there is no space for any altcoins in the industry. This is what prompted the Twitter poll and attack on these so-called “extremists.” Others had their own take on the poll and subject, as usual. ""Supremacists"" has a more negative connotation… In recent years, ""extremists"" has been used more and more to simply mean ""someone who actually believes what they say they do"". — Luke Dashjr (@LukeDashjr) January 7, 2019  Another person actually knocking Litecoin said: I've always thought you seemed like a super good person and for a time I accumulated LTC. That being said I sold all my LTC this year for Bitcoin, and that was not out of ideology. It was a selfish, financial calculation I made because I don't see an enduring reason for LTC. — John Fever [sold BCH at $6K] (@ProgrammableTx) January 6, 2019  Not sure why the person above bought Litecoin because they thought Charlie Lee was a “good person” but that’s probably someone that shouldn’t be investing—just my opinion. Binance’s CEO even joined into the conversation. >> Monero “Mistake”—Now You Can’t Pay for Fortnite Merch with Monero Will be interesting to see how this plays out. But I believe in thousands of blockchain sand millions of tokens. Freedom implies choice. — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) January 7, 2019  From all the rest of the conversation via the initial tweet, it seems Lee isn’t the one who made up the term Bitcoin maximalists. He took that from Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder. It remains unclear why Bitcoin (BTC) supporters need to be placed into a category, but the altcoin leaders, like Charlie Lee, obviously feel it’s necessary. According to CoinMarketCap, BTC broke over the $4,00 threshold recently and is currently trading at $4,044.75 a coin, down – $0.97%, in 24 hours. Featured Image: Depositphotos © GekaSkr

0," A mural in Paris hides a reward in Bitcoin for the first person savvy enough to solve the visual puzzle, and the bounty is growing thanks to donations from the community. The prize, which started as BTC 0.26 earlier today, is now (UTC 01:19 PM) worth BTC 0.2849 (USD 1,142.)  The mural is a play on the iconic Eugène Delacroix work Liberty Leading the People and shows Lady Liberty leading a group of Gilets Jaunes protesters into confrontation as she holds the French flag in the air, and is the work of artist Pascal Boyart, who is often dubbed the French Banksy (a famous anonymous England-based street artist.) Hidden inside the mural is the private key to the prize, to which anyone can donate to increase the amount, but not everyone can participate: Boyart told his Twitter followers that they would need to physically be in Paris and actually in front of the mural in order to take part in the hunt. #StreetArt treasure hunt in Paris with a #Bitcoin puzzle For the 10th birthday of the genesis block, I painted this frescoe in Paris with a 0,26btc ($1000) puzzle in it. Here's the public key: 1NqPwPp7hEXZ3Atj77Ue11xAEMmXqAXwrQ  Thanks to @alistairmilne for sponsoring this 🙏 pic.twitter.com/F7aIkxmp6t The location, which had not been disclosed previously, has been discovered by Twitter user @TZTaughtMe, who claims to be the first person there, later joined by two journalists who were not participating in the treasure hunt. The hunt officially began around 12 hours ago, when Boyart both tweeted and posted his artwork to Reddit. In the comments to his official Reddit post, he revealed that people who cannot physically be there can still solve only a part of the puzzle from behind their computer screens.  One significant difference between the mural and the piece it was inspired by is the fact that Boyart decided to forego showing Lady Liberty’s breasts, instead painting a sort of bra over them. This led some in the community to speculate that this is where the puzzle’s solution could be hidden, accessible by removing part of the painting with acetone or similar chemicals. Still, many others hope that there will be no need to alter the panting to solve the puzzle. This is not the first puzzle to feature a reward in crypto. Several have already risen to prominence, and perhaps the best-known among them is The Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto, a visual puzzle associated with the Bitcoin address 1FLAMEN6 that was created in 2015 with 5 BTC locked in. It was finally solved three years later, having previously been dubbed “fiendishly difficult”, by a programmer who hadn’t even heard of it until a month before finally cracking it."
0," After giving up on their plans to allow listing of crypto-based derivatives and instruments like bitcoin futures on exchanges due to a viewpoint that these products are overly susceptible to speculation in December, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is now reportedly looking into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the digital assets. The FSA is currently gauging industry interest in ETFs tracking digital currencies, Bloomberg reported, citing ""a person familiar with the agency’s thinking."" It is estimated that such ETFs in Japan could revive appetite from retail investors. Japan’s ETF market is worth USD 335 billion (with about 75% owned by the central bank), compared with the USD 3.7 trillion worth of ETFs outstanding in the U.S., according to the report. So far, U.S. and European regulators have not approved ETFs, citing worries about price manipulation or the security of the underlying crypto assets. Securities lawyer and cryptocurrency commentator Jake Chervinsky estimates that the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) will never let a Bitcoin ETF happen. Commenting on the rumors that this instrument might soon go public, Chervinsky said that ""a proposed rule change is auto-approved if the SEC doesn’t make a decision by the deadline, but in reality, it would never happen."" Not going to happen.https://t.co/9TAtxZthDV As for ETFs themselves, some experts do not trust them either. Tyrone Ross, a Managing Partner of NobleBridge Wealth, an investment management and strategic wealth planning firm, said that he wasn’t a fan of Bitcoin ETF, and wouldn’t let his clients “go near it.” He is certain that cryptocurrencies inside of an ETF would only confuse people who don’t understand crypto or ETFs that well to begin with. And he is not alone. Andreas Antonopoulos, a Bitcoin evangelist and serial entrepreneur, also thinks ETFs are a terrible idea and that they “fundamentally violate the underlying principle of peer-to-peer money, where each user is operating not through a custodian but has direct control of their money, because they have direct control of their keys.” He warns that Bitcoin ETF might become an instrument to manipulate bitcoin prices. In the meantime, physically delivered bitcoin futures have been the buzzword in the crypto world lately, with Bakkt and Eris Exchange LLC expected to start offering such contracts early 2019. Moreover, CoinfloorEX (formerly a unit of the UK Bitcoin exchange Coinfloor, and now to be called Coin Futures and Lending Exchange - CoinFLEX), intends to offer the derivatives of some of the largest cryptocurrencies to Asian retail investors as early as February, Bloomberg reported on Monday."
0," The past few hours were very bullish for bitcoin and altcoins. BTC/USD gained bullish momentum and broke the USD 3,850 and USD 4,000 resistance levels. It is currently (UTC 08:00 AM) placed in an uptrend and it could continue to move higher towards the USD 4,150, USD 4,200 and USD 4,400 resistance levels. Ethereum settled above the USD 145 and USD 150 resistance levels. ETH/USD must clear the USD 160 - USD 162 barrier for an upside extension. Ripple price is gaining strength and it recently broke the USD 0.370 resistance. More importantly, litecoin rallied nearly 10% and broke the USD 35 and USD 38 resistances. The current market sentiment is positive and there could be more gains in bitcoin and altcoins. Total market capitalization  There was a solid upward move in bitcoin price  above the USD 3,800 and USD 3,850 resistance levels. BTC/USD even cleared the USD 4,000 weekly resistance to move further into a positive zone. In the short term, there could be a downside correction, but the price remains well supported near USD 3,850 and USD 3,650.
On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 4,050, above which the price may target the next weekly barrier near the USD 4,250 level. Above this last, the price may continue to move higher towards USD 4,400. Ethereum price  remained in an uptrend above the USD 140 support. ETH/USD broke the USD 150 resistance and it is currently trading in a range. 
The price must break the USD 160 - USD 162 weekly resistance to set the pace for more gains. The next hurdle for buyers is near the USD 175 level. On the downside, the main supports are USD 145 and USD 140. Bitcoin cash  gained traction and moved above the USD 160 resistance, but it seems to be struggling to clear the USD 165 and USD 170 resistance levels. BCH/USD may correct a few points, but dips remain supported near the USD 155 and USD 150 levels. Bitcoin SV is trading flat near the USD 88 - USD 90 zone. A break above the USD 90 resistance could clear the path for more gains in the near term.
Ripple price  gained more than 7% recently and it broke the USD 0.365 and USD 0.370 resistance levels. XRP/USD might continue to trade higher if buyers push the price above USD 0.375 and USD 0.380. During the past few sessions, many small cap altcoins gained more than 10%, including DEX, BCZERO, DGTX, HOT, BTC, WTC, NEO and DCN. Out of these, DEX rallied close to 100% and BCZERO is up around 26%. To sum up, bitcoin price is showing positive signs above the USD 3,850 pivot level. If BTC/USD accelerates above USD 4,050, the next stop could be USD 4,200 or even USD 4,400. Similarly, ethereum, ripple and litecoin are likely preparing for more upsides in the coming sessions.

0," Bitcoin’s (BTC) bears would be put on the back foot if prices climb past key resistance lined up at $4,140. The leading cryptocurrency jumped to a two-week high of $4,090 earlier today, as expected, ending a weeklong period of low volume consolidation near $3,800. Notably, the break above $4,000 has added further credence to the short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by the three-day chart on Dec. 20. The job, however, is only half done for bulls, as prices are yet to take out the resistance at $4,140 – the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern. A convincing break above that level would put the bulls back into the driver’s seat. That said, a longer-term bullish reversal would be confirmed only above the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) of $5,567. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $4,000 on Bitstamp, representing a 5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. As seen above, BTC has charted an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, which represents a transition from the bear market to the bull market – a low followed by recovery (left shoulder), a bearish-lower low and recovery (head), and finally a bullish-higher low and recovery (right shoulder). A breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders usually yields a powerful move to the upside. BTC, therefore, could rise well above $5,000 (target as per the measured move method) if the neckline resistance, currently seen at $4,140, is crossed on the back of high trading volumes. Further, the cryptocurrency has found acceptance above the 50-day moving average (MA) hurdle, while the 5- and 10-day MAs are trending north, indicating a bullish setup. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is also biased toward the bulls. Hence, prospects of a bull breakout above $4,140 appear high.  On the monthly chart, the outlook remains bearish while BTC is trading below the 21-month EMA of $5,567. Interestingly, the trendline connecting the December 2017 and November 2017 highs is also located near the 21-month EMA. Forcing a long-run breakout, therefore, is going to be an uphill task for the bulls – more so, as both the 5- and 10-month EMAs are still trending south, indicating a bearish setup. As a result, these averages – currently are located at $4,791 and $5,651, respectively – could work as stiff resistance levels.

0," Angus Champion de Crespigny is an advisor to blockchain projects and a former EY blockchain lead. The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.   Amongst many others, the bitcoin community for the past few years has been working with two particularly important ideas related to the asset’s future. One is the narrative of institutional adoption: the idea that institutions will begin buying (or facilitating the buying) of bitcoin as an investment. The other is decentralization: emphasizing control of one’s own monetary sovereignty and the ease with which people can participate in the network at an affordable cost. While both are important in their own ways, considering how institutions operate, it is likely that these two narratives are going to conflict. This does not need to be a problem, however. What we’re likely to see is a bifurcation in bitcoin usage throughout the world for different purposes, and consequently, how it is handled. This thesis comes from a number of different directions. There is what I’ll call the “hard money” thesis: that bitcoin will be recognized as a superior form of money due to its monetary policy and will be adopted en masse by institutional investors. In this case, these investors are the likes of pension funds, endowment funds, insurers and, possibly, central banks. Part of institutional adoption, however, is looking beyond the underlying benefits of the asset, and into whether there’s an appetite for people to buy, sell, hold and trade bitcoin. Where there is an appetite for a financial asset, institutions will facilitate. In this case, the investors will also include individuals. The challenge faced by institutions in working with bitcoin in either instance, though, is that financial instruments for institutions need to be boring. Institutions rarely custody their own assets. Over many years, custody functions have been centralized with specialized institutions in the financial sector, who will hold the assets and perform all management functions that are needed on behalf of the ultimate asset owners. But for bitcoin, custody is challenging, and not just for the technical reason that private keys need to be secure. How do institutions manage forks? Do they need a central clearing function to offset risk? How do they manage sanctions risks for transaction fees if a block is mined by a miner in a sanctioned country? For institutions to hold the keys is rarely operationally sensible: few financial institutions have the expertise in-house nor have the appetite to take on such a technically complex process. Consequently, for institutions to get on board with bitcoin, these issues will need to be addressed, and they will likely be addressed in the same way that the management of financial instruments usually are – with standards and centralized products. These standards may define what forks to accept and processes to follow to manage sanctions risks, which the industry will want to ensure is in line with peers to manage perceptions to clients and regulators. Centralized products managed by specialized companies may include custodians and clearing houses: we’re starting to see this already. While there is opposition to this centralization, and in particular how certain custodians manage forks, the reality is that few financial institutions, at least in the short term, have a desire to undertake this side of digital asset management. Many seasoned bitcoiners object to this centralization. And rightly so, at a technical level. What’s the point in censorship resistant money if you standardize and centralize it such that it can be censored? As recently covered in Time, bitcoin is effective for freedom because it allows people to store money away from a government they don’t trust. If there is a demand to keep money away from the government and bitcoin is effective in doing that, then naturally countries to which this is applicable will wish to restrict its usage. We have already seen such controls with Zimbabwe and China. For such usage, bitcoin must be decentralized. Centralized custodians, clearing houses, and standards organizations can be influenced by such jurisdictions through law enforcement and consequently will not be held up to be censorship resistant. Now, if bitcoin for some reason is not effective as a tool for freedom, it is unlikely to adopted as such, in which case this whole discussion is moot. As much as I can probably assume that the reader is a fan of bitcoin and bullish for its eventual disruptive power, we should be pragmatic about the obstacles to it being adopted as a store of value. It will need to significantly improve in its ease of use, particularly around key management. It will need a reduction in perceived volatility, and liquidity in these countries that need censorship resistant money, that by their nature likely have capital controls restricting money movement. Ultimately, we will need a shift in perception to bitcoin being seen as a store of value on par with or superior to gold – which is no mean feat in itself. So while I’m optimistic we can get there, we may well have a long road. If Bitcoin is successful in achieving this status, the logical conclusion is that we would expect bitcoin to hold a dual status globally. In countries where people have greater faith in the rule of law and central banks, censorship resistance is less attractive, and thus bitcoin could be seen as an investible commodity akin to gold with the majority of assets held in centralized institutions. In parts of the world under oppressive regimes, however, bitcoin may be closer to an illegal or at the very least highly restricted asset, where there would need to be a greater emphasis and need of self-management of wallets and keys. It would certainly be exciting if it was use in those countries that drove the price for the rest of the world. Centralization of bitcoin products and services are not in and of themselves bad, as there will be a different demand for the asset from different markets. It is critical, however, that bitcoin at its base remains a decentralized, censorship-resistant medium of value transfer and storage: as without censorship resistance, we don’t have an innovation at all.

1," For every bounce up that follows a steep fall, bitcoin investors are seemingly returning to optimism. Data from a DailyFX research note shows that 80% of traders with a position in bitcoin are on the long side – meaning they have positioned themselves for higher prices. According to Marketwatch, this is the highest level of optimism among bitcoin traders since November 2018. According to research analyst Fan Xu at DailyFX, this gives a long-to-short ratio – the ratio between those who are betting on higher prices and those who are betting on lower prices – of 3.44 to 1. There are a few possible reasons for this, but most of all it appears to be a result of renewed optimism after bitcoin and other major coins have surged since mid-December. For ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform, the surge has been particularly strong with a gain of almost 90% since its low on December 14. Bitcoin, on its end, has recorded a gain of roughly 20% since its mid-December low. Bitcoin price chart: Assuming the trading data from DailyFX is correct, it would mean that the long side of the bitcoin trade is now getting quite “crowded,” with a very large number of traders expecting that prices will move higher.  The danger then, is that these traders will be forced to sell if things do not turn out the way they expected. This situation is often characterized as a “long squeeze,” as opposed to the typical “short squeezes” we have seen so many times in bitcoin this year. What is going to happen this time is of course impossible to tell with certainty, but according to DailyFX’s analyst, traders should be wary: “We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests bitcoin prices may continue to fall. Traders are further net-long than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger bitcoin-bearish contrarian trading bias,” she wrote."
1," Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent pullback from highs above $4,200 could trap the bears on the wrong side of the market, the price-volume analysis indicates. The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $3,848, having clocked a low of $3,642 on Dec. 28. At that level, BTC was down 14.7 percent from the Dec. 24 high of $4,272, according to CoinMarketCap. Notably, daily trading volumes across all cryptocurrency exchanges have also dropped in the last few days. At press time, 24-hour trading volume stands at $4.57 billion – down 36 percent from the Dec. 24 high of at $7.24 billion. A low-volume price pullback is widely considered a sign of weak buyers exiting the market and hence is considered insignificant. The recent drop, therefore, is likely a temporary correction and the bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by the 3-day chart on Dec. 20 is still valid. The bullish case, however, would weaken if the cryptocurrency dips below the key support near $3,550. As seen above (prices as per Bitstamp), BTC closed at $4,073 on Dec. 20, confirming a bullish outside-candle reversal (bear-to-bull change). So far, however, the follow-through has been discouraging. Prices have dropped in the last ten days, but so have volumes. The bullish reversal, however, would be invalidated if and when the bullish-higher low of $3,566 carved out on Dec. 27 is breached.  The triangle breakout seen in the 6-hour chart indicates that the rally from the December low of $3,122 has resumed. Meanwhile, the bull flag breakout seen in the hourly chart indicates a resumption of the rally from the Jan. 1 low of $3,629. Therefore, the path of least resistance is on the higher side.  On the daily chart, BTC is likely carving out an inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern with the neckline resistance at $4,170. The bullish setup on the 3-day and intraday chart indicates scope for a test of $4,170 in the next few days. It is worth noting that the 50-day moving average (MA) is still trending south, indicating a bearish setup. As a result, BTC may attract bears if the MA hurdle, currently at $3,900, proves to be a tough nut to crack in the next 48 hours or so.

0," Today is January 3rd, the tenth anniversary of the first block in the Bitcoin blockchain mined, also known as the Genesis block. Of course, the cryptoverse has taken to the internet to celebrate this day, from simply wishing Bitcoin a happy birthday, over going through all the events that brought Bitcoin to where it is today, to ideas on how to celebrate this birthday in a meaningful way.  If you’ve been reading up on the interesting tidbits about Bitcoin’s history, you may know that the genesis block of Bitcoin contains the text “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,” as this was the headline of The Times newspaper on that day. Now, ten years later, that very same newspaper is featuring Bitcoin on the bottom of its front page thanks to cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, where the writing says, “Thanks, Satoshi. We owe you one. Happy 10th birthday, Bitcoin.”  ____ Today's Times newspaper (3rd January 2019) celebrates Bitcoin's 10th BirthdayIncluded on the front page is the hash of the Bitcoin block 554,509. Thanks to @JihanWu  and @btccom_official for including the message ""ThanksSatoshi"" in the Coinbase inputhttps://t.co/HFskR9J6Jv pic.twitter.com/QtSRvI6wNo Included is the hash of the Bitcoin block 554,509, mined today, and co-founder of mining rig manufacturer Bitmain, Jihan Wu, and Bitcoin wallet and major mining pool BTC.com teamed up to have that block include the phrase “Thanks Satoshi” in honor of Bitcoin’s 10th birthday.  Also, it looks like the today's issue of The Times might become extremely popular: Picked myself up 10 copies. Potential to moon 10/10. If you're not lucky to buy one, you can read the article, published in the newspaper, online. And here you can find sellers of the original Bitcoin Genesis Block newspaper, but be ready to pay at least USD 50,000 per copy.   The phrase that Satoshi Nakamoto included on that day was not a purely spontaneous decision: a decade later, it proves that the genesis block was created on the same day the network was released, which means that Satoshi couldn’t have built up a secretly premined chain, undermining the network. However, YouTuber and crypto influencer Ivan on Tech adds another meaning to that phrase: “That's the reason Bitcoin exists. Bitcoin is the cure.” And Reddit user u/jam-hay reminds us that Bitcoin is stronger than ever ten years after its inception: “For years we have had to put up with condescending mainstream media, finance and political pundits sneering at the very thought that a group of volunteer developers could somehow create a free, open-source, decentralized and secure way for everyday people to store and send value to each other almost instantly.. all over the planet and beyond. 10 years on and we have over 2,000+ cryptocurrencies, 16,000+ markets and a combined market cap of $130bn [...] This new wave of Fintech spawned by Satoshi will do to the banking sector, what online shopping has done to brick and mortar shops.” There is also a countdown to the exact time when Bitcoin’s birthday falls: 18:15 GMT. Joining the celebration is Didi Taihuttu, best known as the man who sold almost everything he owned, poured it into bitcoin and moved his family into a trailer park. In his congratulations, he is joined by the rest of his family from their trailer. 🎉 Happy Birthday Bitcoin 🎉 Don't lose faith in #Bitcoin because of the price. Bitcoin is there to decentralize the monetary system, to bank the unbanked, to get back control over our money and provide us of financial freedom and privacy! #cryptocurrency #thebitcoinfamily pic.twitter.com/nIpg2p5ptA And Bitcoin economist Saifedean Ammous reminds us why we love the digital currency so much. “Bitcoin has now been operating for ten years without confirming a single fraudulent transaction, and without deviating from its original monetary issuance schedule. Deal with it!” he wrote on Twitter.  But how do you celebrate if you’d like to be more proactive? Francis Pouliot, CEO and co-founder of Canadian Bitcoin company Bull Bitcoin, tweets his ideas:  Celebrate Bitcoin 10 years with real skin-in-the-game:- do P2P Bitcoin trades as both seller/buyer (friends, localbitcoins @bisq_network)- help local Bitcoin meetup, be Bitcoin 101 speaker - use a Bitcoin ATM- buy a miner - ask for payment in $BTC- pay back a friend in $BTC https://t.co/u2Lx78IErw Twitter user @verretor puts the birthday into perspective: “For Bitcoin's 10th birthday, the U.S. government is shutdown,” he tweeted.

0," Happy Genesis Block Day! Today is also the day when the Proof of Keys event is set to happen for the first time, dubbed the yearly HODLer initiation, when users withdraw their bitcoins from exchanges in order to prove ownership over them. The event is mostly being celebrated, as well as endorsed by many influencers in the community, but there are also those warning that it could all go very wrong. Among outspoken supporters of the Proof of Keys event are even people from cryptocurrency exchanges such as ShapeShift and Coinbase, while the CEO of the largest cryptocurrency exchange with fees Binance, Changpeng Zhao, says he has no opinion about the event: I don't have an opinion.  I know we are #safu.   We will provide what the market needs.  Feel free to do whatever you wish. Meanwhile, Balaji S. Srinivasan, Chief Technology Officer of Coinbase, tweeted instructions on how to send your crypto from Coinbase exchange to Coinbase (or other) wallet.  The point is not to send them back. But to hold your own keys so that you don’t have to trust exchanges. Which is the point of crypto. If you leave your crypto on exchanges you do not own them. Nice try though. Manufacturers of hardware wallets, which ensure that you own your private keys, also took a chance to remind about themselves: Tomorrow is the “Proof of Keys” day – this event entails sending your crypto assets to an address where you own the private keys. This initiative is in line with the popular phrase “Not your keys, not your Bitcoin”.Read more on it here: https://t.co/xlhJc7foVP#ProofOfKeys ShapeShift went a step further. In a blog post titled, “Why We Support #ProofofKeys and You Should, Too,” they went on to explain their opinion: “Bottom line: if you use an exchange versus a cold storage option, such as a hardware wallet, you’ll have to have complete third-party trust that the exchange is holding the funds that they say they are. When your cryptocurrencies are stored on a hardware wallet, you’re in complete control of your crypto.” Another institution supporting the event is Weiss Ratings, a veteran firm dedicated to analyzing investments. “‘Proof of Keys’ that is due tomorrow, will force exchanges to prove they actually have reserves of crypto they claim they own. #Crypto was designed to remove all intermediaries between people and their money, so we stand behind this initiative,” the company tweeted yesterday.  Former Wall Street veterans are also throwing their support behind the initiative. Caitlin Long, who spent 22 years at Wall Street and is now a self-proclaimed blockchain and Bitcoin enthusiast, urged her followers to participate: “Tomorrow is #ProofOfKeys-Jan 3 on 10th anniv of #Bitcoin’s genesis block. If someone else has your private keys do you know if your #BTC is really there? No. Declare your monetary sovereignty by holding your private keys.” And when that FOMO (fear of missing out) truly kicks in, you can’t just let the event pass you by as if you’re not even part of the space.  I didn't have any #bitcoin kept on an exchange, but I bought some and withdrew it anyways to participate in #ProofOfKeys @TraceMayer @coinbase pic.twitter.com/xLY4TPV8NT And if you’d like everyone on the streets to know you’re supporting it, you can buy a cap, or a t-shirt sporting a design related to the event. However, we do not advise wearing an unbuttoned jacket to show off the t-shirt if you’re from the northern hemisphere, as we’re currently in the middle of winter here. Happy #SatoshiRun #ProofOfKeys #BeYourOwnBank, if you don’t control it, it ain’t yours.What a time to be alive :) pic.twitter.com/hSSUJL491T Of course, not everything is just fun and games: some people warn about possible scams and phishing attacks on this day as well. “Tomorrow a lot of scammers will be operating to steal your Bitcoin and take advantage of “proof of keys”. Expect phishing attacks, fake guides on how to get your coins off exchanges, creative scam Twitter/Google ad campaigns targeting the term “proof of keys”, etc. BE VIGILANT!” warns Twitter user @CobraBitcoin, co-owner of bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org. Twitter user @CanMind goes a step further with potential conspiracy theories: “This proof of keys has a potential to be a market manipulation strategy... Users pull cryptocurrencies from exchanges while the [whales] remain inside and play with the prices as they wish! Users try to come back but of course the gains have been made!!” he warned. Whether or not the event will influence the price remains to be seen, but many are already speculating about what could happen. “Most people are expecting the price to rise (even rise dramatically). This won't happen. The price of an asset almost always has the expectations of the masses already built into it, so the people who think that BTC's price will skyrocket tomorrow have already bought in so they won't be buying any more. [...] If the price starts to do a belly dive it will be immediately picked up by all the individuals that were hoping for a dive in order to get some cheap coins so it will be instantly pushed back up,” writes Reddit user u/taranasus. Others are looking at the bright side of the event. “#Proofofkeys allowed me to consolidate my bitcoin holdings. I found I had bitcoin in an exchange that I didn't use for 1 year. Thank you @TraceMayer for this great idea! Happy birthday bitcoin!” writes Twitter user @Godineau.  And of course, we would be very worried if a hyped event happened without jokes to follow it through. “I hope this doesn’t need to be said, but #ProofOfKeys does not mean to post screenshots of your private keys online,” writes @TheBitcoinSOV. And the possible reaction of insolvent exchanges was perfectly captured by @_dnov. Insolvent exchanges when #ProofOfKeys was announced pic.twitter.com/ippHlAG9Kb Also, it looks like the event has it's own song: Remember to keep your 🔑 safe. $btcTbh I made a whole rap about taking your crypto off Coinbase #ProofOfKeys 🌚Full video here: https://t.co/Tszjgs3pS9 pic.twitter.com/9C13RIXe9g While Trace Mayer just reminded why you needs to control your own private keys to your coins: Would you rather have: #ProofOfKeys or #ProofOfRoger? #MtGox✌️@TuurDemeester @SatoshiLite @Excellion @lopp @nvk @CaitlinLong_ @pierre_rochard @bitstein @giacomozucco @adam3us @ToneVays @maxkeiser @theonevortex @jimmysong @aantonop @bensemchee @RoadtoRoota @peterktodd @starkness pic.twitter.com/Q3zQorgTvs"
0," Yesterday, we discussed a possible upward move above the USD 3,800 resistance in bitcoin price. BTC/USD broke the USD 3,800 and USD 3,820 resistance levels, opening the doors for more gains. However, a successful close above the USD 4,000 barrier is needed for buyers to gain momentum. According to Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, a major bottom is near in bitcoin since there is a solid rise in adoption and people are getting more and more involved in the market, Bloomberg reported. Besides, the GTI Vera Convergence Divergence indicator is pointing a sharp increase in buying interest, it added. Therefore, if buyers succeed in clearing the USD 4,000 and USD 4,200 resistance levels, there could be more gains in the near term. Total market capitalization  A good support base is formed near the USD 3,700 level in bitcoin price . BTC/USD broke the USD 3,800 resistance area to set the pace for a test of the USD 3,900 and USD 3,925 resistance levels. The main resistance is near the USD 4,000 level, above which the price may climb toward the USD 4,200 level.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,800, below which the price is likely to test the USD 3,750 support (the previous resistance). The key support is at USD 3,700 and USD 3,680. Ethereum price  performed really well and traded above the USD 145 and USD 150 resistance levels. ETH/USD is up more than 10% and it is approaching the USD 152 and USD 154 resistance levels.
If the price corrects lower, it may find a strong support near the USD 146 and USD 144 levels. The major support is at USD 142, which was a significant resistance earlier.  Bitcoin cash price  gained more than 3% and broke the USD 165 resistance levels. BCH/USD may continue to move higher towards the USD 170 and USD 175 resistance levels. On the downside, supports are visible near the USD 160 and USD 158 levels. Bitcoin SV is trading flat near the USD 90 level. If there is a break above the USD 92 and USD 95 resistance, the price may test the USD 100 level.
Ripple price  moved above the USD 0.360 resistance and it may continue to rise towards the USD 0.365 and USD 0.370 resistances. The key support is at USD 0.360, below which the price may test USD 0.355. During the past few sessions, a few small cap altcoins traded up more than 8%, including LINK, REP, DCN, ICX, DGD, XIN and EOS. Out of these, LINK gained more than 20% and REP is up around 16%. To sum up, bitcoin price is slowly gaining momentum above the USD 3,800. If BTC/USD clears the USD 3,900 resistance, buyers may push the price above USD 4,000. The main driving force is ethereum, dragging bitcoin and other altcoins to the upside. If the current market sentiment stays intact, there could be more gains in bitcoin and altcoins.

0," Bitcoin (BTC) could test a key resistance line for the first time in nearly two months. The widely followed 50-day simple moving average (SMA) line is currently located at $3,940 – $100 above bitcoin’s current price of $3,840 – according to Bitstamp data. The crucial SMA line was last put to test on Nov. 8. Back then, the SMA was located at $6,450 and was serving as a stiff resistance. On Nov. 14, BTC nosedived below $6,000, putting the bears back into the driver’s seat.  As a result, the gap between the 50-day SMA line and price widened sharply in the following two weeks. Notably, on Nov. 25, the 50-day MA line was located at least $2500 above price. That spread, however, has narrowed sharply in the last two weeks, indicating waning bearish pressures. Further, price chart analysis indicates that the bulls have won control, at least for the short-term. BTC, therefore, could test and possibly break above the 50-day SMA line of $3,940 in the next day or two.  As seen above, BTC ran into offers near the 50-day SMA earlier today. Notably, at 00:05 UTC, BTC was trading $40 short of the 50-day SMA. Despite the pullback from intraday highs near $3,900, the outlook remains bullish, as the positive divergence of the relative strength index (RSI), confirmed on Dec. 18, is still valid. Further, 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) are beginning to curl upwards. The RSI is also biased bullish above 50.00. The 50-day SMA is indeed trending south, indicating a bearish setup. The long-term averages, however, are lagging indicators. As a result, the price action always supersedes the long-term moving average lines. It is worth noting that a break above the 50-day SMA, if confirmed, would open the doors to $4,170 – neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. The 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) is also located just below the neckline hurdle. So, $4,170 is the level to beat for the bulls.  The triangle breakout seen in the 6-hour chart indicates that the rally from the December low of $3,122 has resumed. The RSI is printing bullish levels above 50.00. Meanwhile, the stacking order of the 50-candle MA above the 100-candle MA is also a classic bull indicator. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

1," Recently, there was a minor downside move in bitcoin price below the USD 3,700 support. However, buyers appeared near the USD 3,620 - USD 3,650 area and protected more declines. BTC/USD bounced back and traded above the USD 3,680 and USD 3,700 resistance levels. Similarly, ethereum price recovered from the USD 128 - USD 130 support and it seems to be preparing for an upward move towards the USD 150 resistance. On the other hand, ripple price is struggling to gain traction and it must climb above the USD 0.375 resistance to move into a positive zone. Total market capitalization  There was an upward move above the USD 3,700 support in bitcoin price . BTC/USD traded above the USD 3,750 resistance level and it is currently approaching the USD 3,800 resistance area. A break above the USD 3,800 and USD 3,820 resistance levels could open the doors for more gains towards the USD 3,860 and USD 3,900 levels.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,740, below which the price may perhaps test the USD 3,700 support. If there is a break below the USD 3,700 support, the price may test the USD 3,650 support. Ethereum price  gained pace above the USD 130 resistance and settled above the USD 135 level. ETH/USD must break the USD 140 - USD 142 resistance zone to trade towards the USD 148 and USD 150 resistance levels.
If there is a downside correction, the price may test the USD 135 support, below which the price may test the key USD 130 support.  Bitcoin cash price  settled above the USD 150 support it is currently attempting to clear the USD 160 - USD 162 resistance area. An immediate resistance is at USD 165, above which the price may test the USD 175 resistance. Bitcoin SV is currently trading above the USD 85 support and it may continue to rise towards the USD 95 support. On the downside, the key supports are at USD 85 and USD 80.
Ripple price  declined recently and tested the USD 0.345 support level. On the upside, a break above the USD 0.365 and USD 0.375 resistance levels is needed for more gains towards the USD 0.380 level. During the past few hours, a few small cap altcoins gained more than 8%, including DEX, BCZERO, STRAT, VERI, OMG and XIN. Out of these, DEX gained more than 30% and BCZERO rallied nearly 20%. Overall, bitcoin price is placed above the USD 3,700 support and it may continue to move higher in the near term. A proper break and close above USD 3,800 resistance could clear the path for more upsides in BTC/USD. Similarly, ethereum price could accelerate gains if there is a break above the USD 142 - USD 145 resistance area.

1," Bitcoin (BTC) chalked up its longest monthly losing streak in seven years in December. The leading cryptocurrency by market value closed at $3,689 on Dec. 31, representing a 13 percent drop from the monthly opening price of $4,241. That was the fifth straight monthly loss – its worst period since November 2011 – according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Back then, BTC was trading below $20 and had depreciated by 81 percent in five months to November 2011. Notably, the tide had turned in favor of the bulls in the following months. BTC gained 59 percent in December 2011 and traded at record highs above $900 in November 2013. Bitcoin may repeat history by posting gains this month. After all, the cryptocurrency is looking oversold, having lost 52 percent in the last five months and 70 percent in 2018. Further, it is currently down 80 percent from the record high of $20,000 seen in December 2017. The follow-through, however, may lack vigor, as key fundamental metrics are still biased toward the bears. For instance, the widely followed network value transmitted (NVT) ratio of 108 is still reporting overbought conditions. Further, on technical charts, a long run bullish reversal would be confirmed above the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) of $5,547. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,790 on Bitstamp – up 1.86 percent on a 24-hour basis.  Bitcoin is likely charting an inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern on the daily chart with the neckline resistance at 4,180. A UTC close above that level would open the doors to $5,200 (target as per the measured move method). More importantly, the resistance at $4,180 could be put to test soon as the 3-day chart is biased toward the bulls.  As seen above, BTC is holding well above the December low of $3,122. Therefore, the bullish view put forward by the positive divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) in mid-December is still valid.  On the 4-hour chart, the 100-candle moving average (MA) is located by the 200-candle MA, indicating the path of least resistance is on the higher side. The chart also shows a falling channel breakout – a bullish pattern. BTC, therefore, could re-test recent highs above $4,200.

1," Exhale. The nightmare of the 2018 cryptocurrency market is finally over.  Of course, more downside is always possible, if not likely, but at least the year in which bitcoin prices dropped more than 80 percent and the broarder market lost nearly $700 billion of total capitalization is over.  By now, you’re probably well aware the world’s premier cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC), catapulted more than 2,500 percent from its 2017 low to reach a new high of almost $20,000 by December of that year.  Unfortunately for those at the time who were betting on more immediate upside, one of bitcoin’s many speculative bubbles or “hype cycles” reached its peak on Dec. 17, 2017 and its price has been trapped in a steep and record-setting downtrend ever since.  What exactly transpired for the price of bitcoin over the past 365 volatile days is explored below.  Price History When reviewing bitcoin’s 2018 price history, two technical developments stand out: the moving average death cross and breaking support of $6,000.  Moving averages are exactly what the name suggests – an average of bitcoin’s price over specified time periods that when plotted on a chart tend to provide support and resistance for price, as well as the strength and bias of the longer term trend. Multiple moving averages are commonly used on the same chart and complete the bearish development known as a ‘death cross’ when a major short-term moving average crosses below a major long-term moving average, indicating a significant loss of strength to the longer term trend.  BTC/USD witnessed a death cross between the 100- and 200-day moving averages on April 16, confirming the end of its most recent bull market. Before the death cross had taken place, price fell to and found support near $6,000 in February.  All eyes were on this level from that day forward as price went on to test it several more times before finally breaking down nine months later on Nov. 14.   Up until this point, many believed $6k had fortified itself as the ‘bottom’ of the 2018 bear market since it had been strongly defended for what in crypto time seemed like an eternity. Coincidentally, Nov. 14 was the day before one of the world’s largest crypto-networks, bitcoin cash (BCH), underwent a divisive hard fork, which many suspect provided enough uncertainty in the broader market to catalyze bitcoin’s break below $6,000. Now having closed the year at the price of $3,747, 2018 will go in the record books as bitcoin’s worst performing 12-month stretch ever in terms of price.  The leading cryptocurrency’s 2018 performance of a more than 70-percent depreciation from its opening price of $13,062 is considerably worse than the previous record holder, 2014, the year when its price fell roughly 55 percent open to close, according to CoinDesk’s pricing data. Trading Volume  Bitcoin monthly trading volume peaked towards the end of 2017, bringing in a total of $70.2 billion across exchanges in November just before its price reached an all-time high, according to data from Bitcoinity. Trading volumes, along with price, have been stuck in a downtrend ever since and for all of 2018.  Just $7.8 billion in monthly trading volume was recorded in September – a stark difference and 88 percent drop from the high recorded in Nov. 2017 and a 15-month low at the time. The volume performance for 2018 isn’t all discouraging, however.  Using data from Coinmarketcap, a post from Satoshi Capital Research revealed over $2 trillion worth of bitcoin was traded in 2018, which as of Dec. 1 marked a 61 percent increase from the previous year.  While it’s not quite the 96 percent increase recorded in 2017 over 2016, it’s clear investor interest still grew substantially in 2018 despite the relentless bearish market conditions.  NVT Ratio There are plenty of other tools that can be used to evaluate bitcoin’s 2018 market conditions besides technical analysis. Our favorites of which are those created by cryptocurrency researcher Willy Woo that focus on various bitcoin blockchain metrics and its relation to price and network value, like the NVT Ratio. The network value transmitted (NVT) ratio emulates the price to earnings ratio (P/E) used to value a company’s stock price by comparing bitcoin’s network value (market capitalization) and the value of funds transmitted through its blockchain.  A ratio above 100 suggests bitcoin’s price has outstripped its network value, or in other words has become overbought. Conversely, a reading below 100 indicates the market is representing a truer value for bitcoin where price is at less risk of witnessing an aggressive and elongated downtrend.  As can be seen in the above chart, bitcoin’s NVT ratio was well above 100 for almost all of 2018 and even reached its highest level since 2011 above 200, confirming the market was significantly overvalued and a drop in price and network value was highly likely.  Now at the year end, bitcoin has witnessed a near 80 percent drop in network value, falling from $280 billion to $56 billion. While the downtrend is still aggressive, the daily estimated value transmitted through its blockchain stopped plummeting in May and has stabilized above roughly $250 million ever since, allowing the NVT ratio to finally begin deflating.  At the time of writing, bitcoin’s NVT ratio records 108, so the market is still slightly overbought but is much closer to finding a healthy bottom than it was earlier in the year. If the bear market experienced in 2014-15 is any example, the NVT ratio will once again need to stabilize for several months below 100 before another sustained uptrend can begin. It should be noted Blockstream’s liquid side-chain was launched on Oct. 10 which takes some bitcoin volume off-chain so not all transmitted volume is being taken into account in the NVT ratio.  Looking forward   Indeed, 2018 was a historically bad year for bitcoin if solely price action and network value are being taken into account.  Other metrics though, like total trading volume, show a substantial increase in investor interest from the prior year, whereas the NVT ratio shows bitcoin’s latest bubble is coming close to being fully deflated.  All in all, 2019 will be an interesting year for bitcoin as valuations deflate and continue to align with fundamental principles.  Simply put, bitcoin’s market in 2019 can’t possibly be worse than 2018, right? Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st, and AMP at the time of writing.

0," This past week, bitcoin price started a downside correction and traded below the USD 3,880 and USD 3,750 support levels. BTC/USD tested the next major support at USD 3,500 and later bounced back. The price is currently consolidating above USD 3,700 and it seems like it could slowly move higher toward USD 3,880 and USD 4,000 in the near term. Ethereum price rallied recently above the USD 125 and 130 resistance. ETH/USD could gain traction if buyers clear the UD 140 resistance. Ripple price retreated from the USD 0.450 swing high and settled below USD 0.400. However, the price is finding strong bids near USD 0.345 and it might recover above USD 0.380 and USD 0.400. Total market capitalization  After testing the USD 3,500 support, bitcoin price  recovered above USD 3,600 and USD 3,700. BTC/USD is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) trading in a range above the USD 3,700 support, with an immediate resistance at USD 3,780. If there is a break above USD 3,780 and USD 3,800, the price could accelerate gains toward the USD 4,000 weekly resistance level.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,700, below which the next support is at USD 3,620. The main weekly support is at USD 3,500, below which sellers could target the USD 3,200 support area. Ethereum price  formed a solid support near the USD 115 - USD 120 zone and later rallied above USD 125. ETH/USD even broke the USD 130 resistance, but it struggled to gain momentum above the USD 140 resistance. 
Buyers need to clear the USD 140 level to test the weekly resistance at USD 150. On the downside, the first support is at USD 130, below which the main weekly support is at USD 125. If there is a push below USD 125, the price could trade back in a bearish zone. Bitcoin cash  settled above USD 150 support. BCH/USD must break the USD 165 and USD 175 resistance levels to challenge the USD 200 barrier in the coming days. Bitcoin SV is struggling to hold gains above USD 90 and it is currently down 2% to USD 85. If BCHSV continues to move down, it may test the USD 80 or USD 75 support level.
Ripple price  traded sharply lower from the USD 0.450 swing high. XRP/USD tested the USD 0.325 support and later recovered above USD 0.350. The next key resistance for buyers is near the USD 0.380 and USD 0.392 levels. Recently, a few small cap altcoins gained bullish momentum and traded up by more than 8%, including MGO, DCN, IOST, KMD and MOAC. Out of these, MGO gained more than 17% to USD 0.51 and DCN is up around 14%. Overall, bitcoin price is trading above the key USD 3,500 support. If BTC/USD breaks the USD 3,800 and USD 3,880 resistance levels, it could clear the USD 4,000 barrier. Similarly, ethereum and ripple are trading above crucial supports and they may extend gains in the coming sessions.

0," A hacker, or a group of them, has been targeting popular Electrum wallets for Bitcoin since December 21st, and has possibly stolen 243.59 BTC (USD 912,000.) The attack resulted in Electrum wallet apps showing a message on users' computers, urging them to download a malicious wallet update from an unauthorized GitHub (a software development platform) repository. There is an ongoing phishing attack against Electrum users. Our official website is https://t.co/aHiZIZH54e Do not download Electrum from any other source. More on the attack here: https://t.co/x5mPVspKfO The attack has stopped today, at least temporarily, after GitHub admins took down the hacker's GitHub repository. However, admins of the Electrum wallet expect a new attack to soon get underway, with either a new GitHub repo or a link to another download location altogether, according to Zdnet.  This attack was made possible by a vulnerability in the wallet itself, which lets Electrum servers trigger popups with custom text inside users' wallets. This means that the attackers were able to tell users to download their malicious software, which in turn prompted them to enter a two-factor authentication code (2FA), used to later steal the funds: One the victims of the theft took to Reddit to write about their ordeal:  ""I have used electrum a lot, here is how this went down tonight. I log onto my electrum where I have about 1.4xx btc that I was trying to send. When i attempt to send I get a strange message that says ""in order to send please update to the latest version here: https://github.com/electrum-project/electrum"" now this link was weird for two reasons, first off it is not the official link from the electrum site and second it didn't allow me to click it like normal links do/would. I had to copy/paste it into my browser window. I did that and proceeded to download the application here, when I logged on it immediately asked me for my 2 factor code which I thought was a little strange as well as Electrum usually only asks for that when you attempt to send. I kept trying to send and kept getting an error code ""max fee exceeded no more than 50 sat/B"" I then restored my wallet on a separate pc and found that my balance had been transferred out in full to this address: https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/14MVEf1X4Qmrpxx6oASqzYzJQZUwwG7Fb5.""  However, from this address, more than 200 BTC have been sent to an address that holds 243.59 BTC as of the time of writing. After receiving news of attacks, the Electrum team responded by ""silently updating"" the Electrum wallet app, so these messages - like the one urging the download of the malicious code - don't render as rich HTML text anymore, according to SomberNight, a developer at the Electrum wallet team. The developer wrote on GitHub that Electrum developers have currently identified at least 33 malicious Electrum servers that have been added to their network, but the number appears to be around 40-50. Protecting yourself from such attacks can be difficult, but in this particular case, a single red flag can be distinguished: the app asked for a 2FA code at wallet startup, whereas 2FA is usually only needed before a transaction. This is similar to a service asking you for your credit card details when you’re doing anything but paying - they have no reason to need that data at the time. Stay vigilant!"
0," A bet made late last year by chief information officer and co-founder of cryptocurrency hedge fund BlockTower Ari Paul on behalf of the company seems, beyond all reasonable doubt, to be lost. The bet specified that a single bitcoin would be worth at least USD 50,000 by the end of 2018, and there is USD 1 million at stake. The bet would have given the manager the chance to buy 275 bitcoins at USD 50,000 apiece any time before this Friday, when the call options expire, a purchase that would have cost USD 13.8 million. The manager spent just under USD 1 million on those call options. Bitcoin is trading at around USD 3,800 as of the time of writing, a drop of more than 80% from its peak of USD 19,783, when BlockTower made its bet. Back in 2017, in an interview with CNBC, Paul explained that the option contracts BlockTower has purchased expire if the price of Bitcoin fails to reach the prophesied price by the end of 2018. But if it does, it pays out the firm on a 30 to 1 odds. Hence, this USD 1 million bet would generate BlockTower a USD 29 million in profit. At the time, he added, “Bitcoin is volatile. This is a hyper volatile asset. Bitcoin is up more than 1,400% this year. It also falls 30% almost every other month. These calls are a bet that if its volatile to the upside we can easily see over USD 50,000 next year.” ___"
0," Recently, we saw a downside move below the USD 4,100 and USD 3,850 supports in bitcoin price. BTC/USD tested the USD 3,600 - USD 3,620 support area and later started trading in a range. The price is currently consolidating and likely preparing for the next break either above USD 3,850 or below USD 3,620. Similarly, ethereum price declined and tested the USD 125 support, which is acting as a crucial hurdle for sellers. Ripple price is following a declining path and it has trimmed most of its gains from the USD 0.450 resistance. It seems like the market is basing for the next move in the coming sessions.  Total market capitalization  During the past few hours (UTC 06:30 AM), bitcoin price  mostly traded in a range above the USD 3,620 support. BTC/USD could start a decent upward move if there is a proper break above the USD 3,800 and USD 3,850 resistance levels. Above this last, the price will most likely climb above the USD 3,900 and USD 3,950 resistance levels.
On the downside, the main support is near the USD 3,620 level, below which the price may well decline sharply below the USD 3,600 level. If there are more losses, the price could decline towards the USD 3,450 and USD 3,320 support levels. Ethereum price  struggled to move past the USD 130 - USD 135 resistance zone. ETH/USD must settle above USD 135 (hourly close) to initiate a fresh upward move towards the USD 140 and USD 145 resistance levels.
On the flip side, if there is a downside break below the USD 125 support, there is a risk of more losses below the USD 120 support. The next major support awaits at USD 112 where buyers are likely to emerge. Bitcoin cash price  failed to clear the USD 180 and USD 185 resistance levels. BCH/USD declined more than 5% and tested the USD 165 support area. If there is a downside break below USD 160, there could be a test of USD 150. Bitcoin SV is slowly moving higher, but there is a strong resistance near the USD 94, USD 96 and USD 98 levels. 
Ripple price  moved below the USD 0.380 support, which is a bearish sign. XRP/USD must trade above USD 0.375 and USD 0.382 to start a decent recovery in the near term. Recently, there was an increase in selling pressure on small cap altcoins, resulting in declines in DEX, POLY, STRAT, ONT, PIVX, MGO and IOST. Out of these, DEX declined more than 20% and POLY was down around 12%. To sum up, bitcoin price is reaching crucial juncture near the USD 3,620 level. If BTC/USD fails to move past the USD 3,850 resistance, there could be a sharp decline towards the USD 3,320 level in the near term. Likewise, ethereum price must trade above USD 135 to avoid further declines in the near term.

1," One big purpose of Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency was decentralization: not just for the sake of security and removing a single central point of failure, but first and foremost to seize the power over your own funds from centralized entities. That’s what a community called “HODLers of Last Resort” does the upcoming January 3rd: participate in a Proof of Keys celebration by demanding and taking possession of all bitcoins held by trusted third parties on their behalf.  This practice, considered a test of trust by the community, is said to prove possession and strengthen network consensus.  “You can consider Proof of Keys a combat readiness drill. Hopefully, it will help prevent further annoying skirmishes with those who despise individuals empowered with monetary sovereignty,” the official website explains.  The movement is a chance for users to reassert possession over their own holdings, as well as to force third parties to prove that they actually hold all the assets they claim. According to Trace Mayer, host of the Bitcoin knowledge podcast and one of the main advocates for Proof of Keys, the event is designed to be a “celebration.” “The idea of Proof of Keys is to show to the [crypto] community that there is still control of our funds,” Mayer said in a video announcement. “Lots of new people have come into the community… I think it’s important for us to declare and redeclare our monetary sovereignty on a regular basis”. Private keys are, in short, a secret string of letters and numbers used to authorize transactions, signifying actual ownership of digital assets. Despite this, many crypto owners aren’t actually in possession of their private keys, relying instead on third-party entities like exchanges or custodial services to safeguard their holdings. This may seem like a non-issue - after all, banks work the same way - but the ideals behind Bitcoin, as well as legitimate safety concerns, warrant a check up at least out of principle.  The movement has garnered a lot of support. Over the past few weeks, many prominent figures in the crypto community, such as cryptography expert Nick Szabo, have added [Jan/3 [key emoji]] to their Twitter handles to show support for the operation. The mantra behind it - “Not your keys; not your bitcoin” - was initially coined by Andreas Antonopoulos, famous Bitcoin evangelist. The choice of date is no coincidence either: on January 3rd, 2009, Bitcoin’s Genesis block (first block of the blockchain) went live. The concept for the event originated from Reddit user “sotashi,” whom Mayer credited on his new website. Mayer has invited anyone interested in participating in the Proof of Keys event to tweet or retweet his message and fill out a form on the Proof of Keys website with links to their tweets. As of the time of writing, 246 people have filled out the form, including crypto personalities such as Keiser Report co-host Stacy Herbert and Adamant Capital founder Tuur Demeester. However, not everyone is supporting the initiative: ""do banks support people emptying their bank account""?? by withdrawing your coins from exchanges you're taking away their liquidity and power to manipulate the market. never store your coins on any exchange be your own bank with a hardware wallet like @LedgerHQ ,@Trezor etc. This event will also be “The ultimate stress test,” Mayer added, given that the movement of participants’ coins would result in a large number of transactions on that day. Noting that “Companies and exchanges must prove their trustworthiness and consensus,” he adds: “This simple exercise costs little, perhaps a few transaction fees, yet proves possession and strengthens network consensus [...] Then on the 4th of January there can be a return to business as usual with renewed confidence based on Proof of Keys.” Reddit user u/Porriz explains the significance of this: “Crypto is meant to be owned by yourself, safeguarded by yourself, stored by yourself. Every time you ‘buy’ coins in exchange and leave it there, you really don’t own any of those. Best services are services that lets you buy to any btc address you provide, eg. straight to your hardware wallet. The point is, that you do not have the coins unless you have private keys to yourself. You can achieve this by installing a software wallet on your phone/computer, generating paper wallet or buying a hardware wallet and moving the funds to those wallets. That is the only way to ensure you have the coins if eg. exchanges goes bankrupt, scams happen in exchanges, or anything similar happens.” u/FixedGearJunkie adds, “Really you're pulling it from the bank's pocket and putting it in your pocket. Theoretically it should have zero impact on the market as those coins have already been ‘bought.’ But if literally everyone that owned Bitcoin which was still on an exchange participates the outcome may be interesting and beneficial to the ecosystem.”"
1," It seems that Wall Street is in limbo regarding its cryptocurrency plans, even when some crypto scene players are calling the bottom. However, this silence of the institutional players might be illusory.  Joseph Lubin, co-founder of the Ethereum platform and founder of blockchain software technology company ConsenSys, recently tweeted: I am calling the cryptobottom of 2018. This bottom is marked by an epic amount of fear, uncertainty, and doubt from our friends in the 4th and crypto-5th estates. In a series of tweets, he goes on to explain that the recent news of ConsenSys 2.0 cutting its staff brought on an “epic amount of conjecture and preemptive paranoia,” but that the company is still going strong. In conclusion, he adds, “Peaking [sic] into 2019, if you could see the landscape through my eyes, you'd have to wear shades.” Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the CEO of largest cryptocurrency exchange by 24 hour trading volume with fees, Binance, was also equally optimistic in a recent interview: “I think that people in the industry are still very confident about the future.” The crypto community may be optimistic, but the traditionalists seem wary. According to people familiar with the matter, banking giant Goldman Sachs has made little to none progress in their crypto projects, having signed up only 20 clients, Bloomberg reported. Daniel H. Gallancy, chief executive officer of New York-based SolidX Partners, a company looking to launch Bitcoin ETFs in the US, told the news outlet: “The market had unrealistic expectations that Goldman or any of its peers could suddenly start a Bitcoin trading business. That was top-of-the-market-hype thinking.” Also, other undisclosed sources familiar with the matter, state that yet another giant, Morgan Stanley, has been technically prepared to offer swaps tracking Bitcoin futures since at least September, yet thus far has not traded a single contract. There had also been rumors about British bank Barclays exploring the possibilities of crypto integration, but a spokesman told Bloomberg that the bank currently has no plans for a crypto trading desk.  However, crypto pros see signs institutions are getting ready to jump back in if they need to. “The more important story is all the infrastructure that’s being built now to enable institutional trading,” Ben Sebley, a former Credit Suisse Group AG trader who is now head of brokerage at crypto boutique NKB Group, told Bloomberg. While Eugene Ng, a former Deutsche Bank AG trader in Singapore who has set up crypto hedge fund Circuit Capital, added that ""It appears as if progress is coming to a halt, yet nothing could be further from the truth."" ""The bear market is going to allow many of these institutions to build the proper foundations without rushing to build-out infrastructure without adequate testing for fear of missing out on a gold rush,"" Ng said. Moreover, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, is likely to launch its Bitcoin futures trading and custody platform Bakkt in January, despite a possible delay by a few days. Bakkt has long been regarded as a big step of traditional investors into crypto that could boost the adoption of Bitcoin.

Watch Henri Arslanian, fintech and crypto leader for Asia at PricewaterhouseCoopers, discussing the outlook for the cryptocurrency markets. He expects 'exciting things' for crypto ecosystem in 2019."
1," This past week, bitcoin price climbed above the USD 3,500 and USD 3,800 resistance levels. It opened the doors for more gains and BTC/USD broke the USD 4,000 hurdle. The current price structure is positive above USD 4,000 and it seems like the price is preparing for more upsides above the USD 4,600 and USD 4,800 levels. Ethereum performed well recently and broke the USD 120 and USD 140 resistance levels. Similarly, ripple broke the USD 0.400 resistance and rallied above the USD 0.415 barrier. Going forward, there could be more gains as long as bitcoin is trading above USD 3,720. Total market capitalization  There was a sharp upward move above the USD 4,000 resistance in bitcoin price . BTC/USD is up nearly 5%, with an immediate resistance at USD 4,250. If BTC/USD breaks the USD 4,250 resistance, it could test the next key resistance at USD 4,600. The main weekly resistance for the current wave is near the USD 5,000 handle.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 4,000, below which the weekly support is at USD 3,750. If there is a daily close below USD 3,750, the price may decline towards the USD 3,400 or USD 3,320 levels. Ethereum price  gained a lot of bullish momentum and broke the USD 124, USD 128 and USD 132 resistance levels. ETH/USD is up more than 15% and it tested the USD 150 resistance.
The price is currently correcting lower towards the first support at USD 142. If there are more losses, the price could test the USD 132 support. The main weekly support is at USD 125 and the key weekly resistance for buyers is at USD 150 followed by USD 155. Bitcoin cash  is trading nicely above the USD 200 support. BCH/USD is up around 7% to USD 205 and it could trade further above the USD 210 and 215 resistance levels. Bitcoin SV is also trading with a bullish bias above the USD 100 - USD 105 support. BCHSV needs to break the USD 112 - USD 115 resistance to climb towards USD 125.
Ripple price  finally broke the USD 0.400 - USD 0.402 resistance area. XRP/USD climbed more than 15% and it even broke the USD 0.415 resistance.

Out of these, PIVX rallied more than 40% to USD 0.95 and QTUM is up around 22% to USD 2.95. To sum up, there are a lot of positive signs on charts of bitcoin, indicating more gains above USD 4,250. BTC/USD could extend the current bullish wave towards the USD 4,600 or USD 5,000 level. Likewise, altcoins like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, neo, icon, qtum, tron and cardano may extend gains in the coming days.

0," American singer Mariah Carey may have to revise her Christmas hit very soon, as various survey show that many prefer to get cryptocurrencies as a present.  For example, for the first time, teenagers said they wanted cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and Fortnite “V-Bucks” virtual currency instead of cash, gift cards and gas money, according to the “Holiday 2018” consumer report released in November by investment bank and asset management firm Piper Jaffray. The popularity of cryptocurrencies on the internet, from social media to online games, is drawing people to the nascent industry. From a way towards financial independence and autonomy to a lesson in investing, cryptocurrencies as a gift are attracting many fresh faces. Especially, when the young generation spends more time in front of computers and lives an increasingly digital life. In different online games, more and more so-called virtual currencies are used to buy and sell items in the game. For many, in-game currencies like V-Bucks, from the wildly popular, online third-person shooter game Fortnite that is used to purchase outfits, “skins” and “Battle Passes” but holds no value outside of the game, are the first contact they have with virtual currencies. In some respects, cryptocurrencies are similar to the virtual money you find in a video game. You buy them with fiat currency, they have no tangible form, and you can use them to buy the goods and services you desire. Another indication of this trend are Twitter polls. Although Twitter’s algorithm does not let people see who voted for what, thus preventing any insight into potential trends such as the age of respondents, their area of origin etc., it can be reasonably assumed that most voters are relatively young, as they tend to be more tech-savvy than their elders - thus more likely to use Twitter in the first place.  Two of these come from the Bank of England and former Texas Congressman Ron Paul and show that digital currencies are vastly preferred to other options.  The Bank of England does not specify what “digital currencies” they mean in their question “If you receive money as a gift at Christmas, what’s your favourite way to get it?” but this option took 71% of the votes, whereas 20% of respondents voted for cash, 7% for bank transfer, and only 2% for gift vouchers. ___ A Twitter user reacted:  You just can't say #bitcoin .. can you?Let me help.B - I - T - C - O - I - NB - I - T - C - O - I - NB - I - T - C - O - I - NB - I - T - C - O - I - NB - I - T - C - O - I - NB - I - T - C - O - I - NB - I - T - C - O - I - NB - I - T - C - O - I - N Ron Paul, meanwhile, does not beat around the bush with his wording: the question is, “A wealthy person gifts you USD 10,000. You get to choose in which form you’ll accept the gift. But there’s a catch: You must keep the gift in the form that you choose for 10 years without touching it. In which form would you accept the gift?” The options are Bitcoin (50% of votes), gold (37%), US 10-year Treasury Bonds (11%) and Federal Reserve Notes (2%). ____ If you’re still wondering what to buy your friends for Christmas, check out our list of ideas. No matter what your budget is, you’re bound to find something to save you so close to the 25th, especially if you’re not that close to the person anyway. If you are - you should really consider buying gifts earlier. Merry Christmas and happy holidays!"
0," Crypto players from around the globe are chiming in on the direction of the Bitcoin price in 2019. Will it continue to see price crashes? Or will the current recovery continue? Better yet, has the industry had a good year and will it continue to have significance in the new year? Earlier in the week, we heard from bears, like Erik Finman who called Bitcoin “dead;” and we heard from Spencer Bogart, a Bitcoin bull, who not only said BTC will continue to rise, but that 2018, contrary to popular belief, has been one of the best years for the cryptocurrency.  Today, word surfaced that the President of Coinbase, Asiff Hirji, believes something similar to Bogart. Despite the crashes experienced in 2018 (such as the bearish run that sent the Bitcoin price to a low of $3,200), Asiff Hirji believes BTC is recovering.  In his interview with CNBC’s Fast Money, Hirji said this recovery isn’t surprising and that it’s likely to continue into 2019. That’s a statement in complete opposition of the thoughts of Erik Finman. “Some things are never as good as they seem,” said the Coinbase President, “and never as bad as they seem.” Bitcoin soaring this week as the markets selloff. Here's what @coinbase president @asiffhirji had to say about the move pic.twitter.com/dCrXkhq5bz — CNBC's Fast Money (@CNBCFastMoney) December 20, 2018  During the interview, Hirji spoke on the performance of the crypto market in the last year. According to Hirji, there’s been more innovation this year in the market. “We’ve never had as much innovation as we have today,” Hirji explained, citing, for instance, how cryptocurrencies are getting more visible. >> Facebook Cryptocurrency: Is the Tech Giant Developing a Stablecoin? Spencer Bogart, also during a Fast Money interview, spoke on something similar, calling 2018 a “fantastic year” for BTC, despite the Bitcoin price crashes. Speaking also on innovation, Bogart said this year is the first time we have scaled the digital currency “with a lightening network,” making transactions quick and cheap. At the time of writing, the BTC price is $3,905.13. It’s vital to take comments such as Asiff Hirji’s into consideration. While it’s easy to oust BTC from your mind due to the recent Bitcoin price crashes, we must also recognize the good that occurred during the year, such as an increase in innovation. What do you think? Let us know in the comments below. Featured Image: Depositphotos/Piter2121"
0," It seems that, famous Bitcoin bull and head of Fundstrat Global Advisors, Tom Lee, has given up forecasting Bitcoin price.  In a note to clients, dated December 13th, Lee wrote, “We are tired of people asking us about target prices [...] Because of the inherent volatility in crypto, we will cease to provide any timeframes for the realization of fair value,” Bloomberg reported. His decision to opt out of the forecast game may not come as a surprise, as his predictions were notable for being highly optimistic, as well as falling very far off the mark this year. He started out by saying that Bitcoin could climb back to USD 20,000 by mid-year and even reach USD 25,000 by the end of December. He later amended this end-of-the-year forecast, pulling it down to a USD 22,000 - USD 20,000 range. Then in November, when Bitcoin was trading at around USD 5,500, Lee was certain the price would triple in the remaining month and a half. As it is now, we are ten days out from 2019, and the price is stubbornly refusing to follow these forecasts, currently trading at around USD 4,000 - still more than what we have seen throughout most of December. Lee wasn’t discouraged then either, instead saying that the market is wrong and that Bitcoin’s true value lies between USD 13,800 and USD 14,800, given the number of active wallet addresses, usage per account and factors influencing supply. This was yet another of his statements that was met with ridicule, and would prove to be the last prediction he gave before quitting the issue altogether. Bitcoin price chart: Tom Lee is hardly the only one whose predictions fell short. Many were hoping for an end of the year bull run similar to what happened in December 2017, when many cryptocurrencies reached their all-time highs, and Bitcoin itself climbed to almost USD 20,000. To the contrary, 2018 has disappointed many, but the internet does not forget and so many of the forecasts by other notable names in the industry still stand. For example, in May, Arthur Hayes of BitMEX estimated that Bitcoin will be worth USD 50,000 by 2018 year end, however, in November he was already talking about a USD 2,000 - USD 3,000 range. In November 2017, Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital forecasted that Bitcoin might reach USD 40,000 in 2018. In November this year he estimated that the price will stand in a USD 3,000 - USD 6,000 range ""until institutional investors step in."" Meanwhile, software tycoon John McAfee still stands by his prediction that Bitcoin will reach USD 1 million by the end of 2020, which is best known by the fact that McAfee promised to eat his own genitalia on national TV if that should not happen. Other, less attention-grabbing predictions include investor Tim Draper, who was “told by spirits” that Bitcoin would reach USD 250,000 by 2022; Anthony Pompliano, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, a digital asset management firm, who saw BTC rising to USD 50,000 by the end of this year; and Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of digital-asset investment firm BKCM LLC, who agrees with Draper on the USD 250k by 2022 forecast."
0," Yesterday, we saw a solid bullish wave above USD 3,700 in bitcoin and discussed the chances of more gains. BTC/USD did gain bullish momentum and broke the USD 3,900 and USD 3,950 resistance levels. Buyers were even successful in breaking the USD 4,000 barrier. Similarly, ethereum and ripple extended upsides and traded above the USD 110 and USD 0.375 resistance respectively. The best performers were bitcoin cash and bitcoin SV since both gained more than 40%. The market sentiment is clearly positive (UTC 08:20 AM) and it seems like bitcoin buyers outclassed sellers. Total market capitalization  After a minor downside correction, bitcoin price  started a fresh upward move. BTC/USD broke the USD 3,900 and USD 3,950 resistance levels and later surpassed the USD 4,000 hurdle. The price is currently up more than 5% and it is facing resistance near the USD 4,100 level.
If there is a break above the USD 4,100 and USD 4,200 levels, the price is likely to accelerate towards the USD 4,550 resistance. On the downside, an immediate support is at USD 3,950, below which the price may test the USD 3,820 level. Ethereum price  rallied above the USD 110 resistance. ETH/USD tested the USD 118 level and later corrected lower.
However, declines were limited and the price bounced back above USD 112. It is currently up more than 10% and it seems like buyers could make an attempt to clear the USD 118 and USD 120 resistance levels. The key support are USD 110 and USD 108. Bitcoin cash price  remained the best performing cryptocurrency among the top 10. BCH/USD rallied more than 50% and broke the USD 200 and USD 210 resistance levels. The next stop for buyers could be USD 225 followed by USD 235. Bitcoin SV also gained traction and climbed above the USD 110 and USD 120 resistance levels. It is currently trading near USD 128 with a bullish angle.
Ripple price  did not gain much and trimmed around 2% gains. XRP/USD retreated from the USD 0.380 resistance and it is currently trading near the USD 0.360 support. A break above USD 0.370 and USD 0.380 is needed for a solid upward move. The past few sessions were very bullish and many small cap altcoins gained more than 15%, including CRO, BCD, BTG, AION, DASH, ADA, MIOTA, AE, PIVX and TRX. Out of these, CRO rallied more than 30% and bitcoin diamond is up around 26%. Overall, bitcoin is trading nicely above the USD 3,900 and USD 3,800 support levels. Therefore, there are high possibilities of more gains above the USD 4,080 and USD 4,100 levels in the near term. If BTC/USD continues to gain bullish momentum, altcoins such as ethereum, bitcoin cash, bitcoin SV, ripple, litecoin, neo and others are also likely to climb further higher.

0," Two members of the United States Congress have made a bid to change securities legislation dating back to the early 1930s, reclassifying cryptocurrencies and potentially making room for the introduction of cryptocurrency market regulations. The bipartisan bill is named the Token Taxonomy Act, and was put forward by Republican congressman Warren Davidson and Darren Soto of the Democrats. The draft law proposes making key changes to the Securities Act (1933) and the Securities Exchange Act (1934). It would specifically exclude cryptocurrencies, instead creating a clear legal definition of “digital tokens,” which would be excluded from the two acts, and thus would no longer automatically be regarded as securities. Today is the last day of Congress’ current session, meaning there is little real chance that the bill will be passed before the year is out. However, the draft law’s authors appear keen to table it again once Congress reconvenes in 2019. A number of America’s most prominent blockchain and cryptocurrency businesspeople have been calling for legal clarification. Davidson is a known blockchain proponent, and chaired a meeting of around 50 major financial and cryptocurrency-related companies in September this year. The regulatory Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) currently makes use of the “Howey Test,” an evaluation assessment created by the Supreme Court back in 1946. The test allows courts to determine whether certain transactions should qualify as ""investment contracts.” Courts have been using this test to assess whether cryptocurrencies can be considered as securities – despite complaints from critics, who call the test an ineffective way to assess digital, blockchain-powered tokens. CNBC quotes Kristin Smith, the head of the Blockchain Association, the “first Washington blockchain lobby group,” as saying, “Decentralized networks don’t fit neatly within the existing regulatory structure. [The bill] is a step forward in finding the right way to regulate them. It shows that there’s momentum on both sides. There's interest among bipartisan members.” Smith is also quoted as saying that the bill “lays groundwork for the next Congress"" – which will open with a Democrat majority next year. Smith also states that, if the bill receives Congress’ approval, cryptocurrencies will “likely fall under the purview of the Federal Trade Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC),” rather than remain under the control of the SEC. The SEC has previously stated that it considers all initial coin offerings (ICOs) as securities, with the specific exceptions of Bitcoin and Ethereum, both of which are considered “commodities,” and are now regulated by the CFTC. As reported by Cryptonews.com, governments will likely focus on two cryptocurrency-related regulation areas in 2019: taxation and regulation surrounding offerings/marketing to the public. Having seen that cryptocurrencies are becoming more safely policed, the general public may become more willing to use and adopt them."
0," Bitcoin (BTC) is looking increasingly bullish on a key technical chart following its strong move above $4,000. The leading cryptocurrency by market value first teased bullish reversal on Dec. 17 with the creation of an “outside reversal” candle on the widely followed 3-day chart. The early indicator of a bearish-to-bullish trend change, however, needed confirmation in the form of a positive follow-through. Alongside BTC’s $600 rally, the cryptocurrency closed above $4,000 yesterday confirming the bullish reversal on the 3-day chart. BTC, therefore, could rise to next major resistance of $4,400 in the near-term. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $4,000 on Bitstamp, largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis.  Confirmation of the bearish-to-bullish trend change can be seen on the 3-day chart above, where the last candle has ended well above $3,590 – the high of Monday’s outside reversal candle. Adding credence to that positive trend change is BTC’s move above the 10-candle exponential moving average (EMA) yesterday. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has jumped into undersold territory, validating a bullish divergence created on Dec. 15.  On the daily chart, BTC created a “gravestone doji” candle on Wednesday – widely considered an early sign of bearish reversal. The recovery rally from 15-month lows near $3,100 would likely have ended had BTC closed yesterday below $3,642 (Wednesday’s low). The cryptocurrency, however, closed well above $3,924 (high of gravestone doji), reinforcing the bullish view put forward by Tuesday’s convincing close above $3,633. Other technical studies are also biased toward the bulls. For instance, the 5- and 10-day EMAs are trending north and the 14-day RSI is holding well above 50.00.

1," The market seems to be getting better as original cryptocurrency Bitcoin climbs above USD 4,000 for the first time since the beginning of December. With a price increase of more than 8% in the past 24 hours as of the time of writing (UTC 10:20 AM), many in the crypto community breathe a sigh of relief. Bitcoin price chart: It may be too early to celebrate, however.  “The market is extremely oversold by most metrics - near the most oversold in Bitcoin’s history,” Mike McGlone, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst in New York said on Wednesday. According to McGlone, Bitcoin will form a new floor in 2019, which will be even lower than current prices in spite of the coin’s relative-strength index and its “extreme discount” to most moving averages. In either case, the fundamentals of Bitcoin and Ethereum networks have not fallen as much as prices have, author of the popular book Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond, Chris Burniske, said in December. Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, a social trading and investment platform, thinks short covering, or the buying in of assets that have been sold short (typically to avoid loss when prices move upwards) is the only reason for the green market.  “Especially after the short squeeze, we saw on Monday, today's action is simply a continuation of that. Markets are made of people and it's likely that most people will be looking to reduce their exposure before the holidays. Over the last few weeks, there have been a lot of high leveraged short positions building up and when those sell positions are closed, it creates upward pressure on market prices."" According to Greenspan, the evidence of this can be found hiding in plain sight as Bitcoin Cash is up by more than 40% in the past 24 hours and represents proof of this reason for market movements.  “Take a look at how Bitcoin Cash, which has probably been the most controversial of coins and many have blamed for the recent slide, is up about double of what the rest of the market has done today,” Greenspan adds. Meanwhile, on Wednesday evening, a popular crypto trader, known on Twitter as Blackbeard, asked his 33,000 followers to share their bitcoin price prediction for the end of this year. Out of almost 200 replies the majority estimated that bitcoin will close 2018 in a range of around USD 3,000 - USD 4,000.  Other cryptocurrencies are also in green: XRP has gained around 5%, ETH is close to 7% and the others follow similar upward slopes, while Bitcoin Cash is the clear winner with a 40% increase. In the top 50 coins by market cap, the only “loser” is Maker with -1%. Bitcoin’s market capitalization also hit a two-week high of USD 70 billion, while the price itself had not been seen above USD 4,000 since December 4th.  ____

1," Yesterday, we saw a positive upward move above the USD 3,600 and USD 3,700 resistance levels. BTC/USD even traded above USD 3,900 and later corrected lower. However, downsides were limited and the price bounced back above USD 3,750. Similarly, ethereum extended gains towards USD 110 and later corrected lower. The USD 100 zone acted as a support and the price is still trading in a bullish zone. Bitcoin cash performed well recently and it broke the USD 130 and USD 140 resistance levels. The overall market sentiment is still positive (UTC 08:00 AM,) suggesting more gains in the near term.  Total market capitalization  There was a solid bullish extension above the USD 3,750 and USD 3,820 resistance levels in bitcoin price . BTC/USD broke the USD 3,900 barrier and later corrected lower. However, the previous resistance at USD 3,650 - USD 3,700 acted as a support and prevented further declines.
The price bounced back and traded above the USD 3,750 and USD 3,800 resistance levels. It is currently up around 3%, with an immediate resistance at USD 3,850. If buyers remain in action, the price is likely to clear the USD 3,900 and USD 3,950 resistance levels in the coming sessions. Ethereum price  traded close to the USD 108 - USD 110 resistance and later corrected lower. ETH/USD corrected below the USD 105 level, but the USD 100 support acted as a solid buy zone.
The price bounced back and it is currently up close to 3%. The first resistance for buyers is near the USD 105 level, above which the price may trade to a new weekly high, probably above USD 110. Bitcoin cash price  remained in a solid uptrend above the USD 120 resistance. BCH/USD gained more than 25% and it recently broke the USD 135 and USD 140 resistance levels. The next challenge for buyers is near the USD 148 - USD 150 zone. BCHSV also started a nice upward move and moved up by around 8%. It is currently trading near USD 90 and it may perhaps test the USD 95 or USD 100 resistance level.
Ripple price  climbed above the USD 0.380 resistance, but it faced a lot of offers near the USD 0.390 resistance. XRP/USD may continue to rise and it is likely to revisit the USD 0.380 or USD 0.390 resistance. Many small cap altcoins rallied recently by more than 10%, including STRAT, LINK, WAVES, PAY, AION and BCN. Out of these, STRAT performed really well and extended gains above the USD 1.40 resistance. Similarly, LINK broke the USD 0.30 resistance and gained close to 25%. To sum up, the market sentiment is pointing more gains in bitcoin above the USD 3,800 level. There are even chances of an upside acceleration above the USD 4,000 resistance in the near term (Update: bitcoin increased above USD 4,000 later today.) Similarly, ethereum could break the USD 110 resistance and ripple price may test the USD 0.400 resistance.

1," Bitcoin’s ongoing recovery rally faces a major obstacle that could impede progress towards $5,000, according to the technical charts. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization jumped to a two-week high of $4,108 earlier today, validating the short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change confirmed earlier this week. Notably, the break above the psychological hurdle of $4,000 looks sustainable, as 24-hour trading volume has jumped to one-month highs above $8 billion. As a result, more bargain hunters could join the party, creating further upward pressure on prices. Even so, the rally may stall near $4,400 for some time, as the area around that psychological level is packed with key technical lines. As of writing, BTC is trading at $4,040 on Bitstamp, representing an 8 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  The above chart shows: The relative strength index (RSI) on the hourly and 4-hour charts is now reporting overbought conditions, too. All this combined, BTC will likely have a tough time scaling the stiff resistance zone of $4,400-$4,430 in a single attempt. Moreover, a consolidation or a minor pullback from the current level of $4,040 will allow the RSI on the hourly and 4-hour chart to roll over from the overbought territory and realign in favor of the bulls. That, if confirmed, could ease BTC’s progress across the resistance zone. As a result, the move past that crucial resistance could yield a quick rally to the next psychological barrier of 5,000 Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

1," Bitcoin’s (BTC) relief rally gathered pace on Thursday, pushing prices to two-week highs above the psychological hurdle of $4,000. The cryptocurrency rose to a high of $4,067 at 09:06 UTC – a level last seen on Dec. 4 – according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Its market capitalization also hit a two-week high of $70 billion. At press time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at $4,000 – up 28 percent from the 15-month low of $3,122 reached earlier this week. The recovery rally was overdue as BTC had been looking extremely oversold as its value dropped by 50 percent over the last four weeks. The bounce in the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is again boding well for the broader markets. As of writing, names like ether, XRP, stellar and litecoin are all reporting 2 percent gains, as per CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin cash (ABC/SV combined) is up 30 percent and lesser-known cryptocurrencies like stratis and Chainlink have gained 45 percent and 27 percent, respectively, in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the list of cryptos posting losses today includes maker and linkey, both of which are down 5 percent. Bitcoin’s move above $4,000 validates the bullish setup seen in the short-term technical charts. As a result, the focus now is on the next major resistance lined up at $4,400 (Dec. 29 high).

1," Despite Bitcoin’s intense price drop in recent months, some still believe it is going to turn it around next year. And there’s nothing to say it definitely won’t; in the last three days, Bitcoin has packed on 18% in gains. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap jumped from $3,181 to $3,776 in under three days, proving further that nobody can truly know where this coin is headed next. One advocate for its future upturn is Mike Kayamori, CEO of Quinone, a Japan-based crypto exchange platform. Speaking with Bloomberg TV, Kayamori believes that by the end of 2019, Bitcoin won’t just have increased its price, but it will hit a new all-time high. Is he just being hopeful or is there anything to back this up? The future can always appear promising, but 2018 has been anything but for Bitcoin. The crypto market has been truly bearish all year, wiping 80% of its value off the board since January. Bitcoin was priced at around $20,000 this time last year; now it is struggling to stay above $3,000. There have been some brief bullish runs here and there, but overall, Bitcoin has been on a steady downward spiral for most of the year. It doesn’t help that it’s taken most altcoins with it. >> Spencer Bogart: Bitcoin Price Can Go Lower or Higher, Either Way It’s a Good Asset But for Kayamori, the reason for the current state of Bitcoin is simply a lack of newness in the crypto market. Believing that “there’s nothing new, no catalyst” to propel the market forward, he could be right. Cryptocurrencies grew their value from hype, after all, and there has been very little newness to continue the momentum. But what is new in Kayamori’s opinion is that Japanese exchanges are adapting to Japan’s regulations and the country is open to more industry players. This, he thinks, will help to spur on adoption, at least in Japan anyway. The CEO also went on to say that the arrival of Fidelity Digital Asset Services by Bakkt, as well as other investor-focused products in early 2019, will give “new momentum and sentiment” and could drive a bullish Bitcoin rebound.

1," The pre-Christmas week has been marked with bitcoin's price jumping almost 20% in three days and with other important developments for the whole Bitcoin network. As the competition among Bitcoin miners was dropping for more than a month, mining itself has become easier and the market bounced back this week, it encouraged some miners to strengthen their focus on the Bitcoin mining again.   The average hash rate, or computing power, of the Bitcoin network, that was decreasing for more than a month, started to picking up on December 14, or even before the price jump on Monday. Moreover, yesterday, the Bitcoin mining difficulty dropped less than estimated, or by 9.56%. BTC.com, a major mining pool, forecasted a 16% drop. However, now, the pool estimates that the difficulty will drop by another 8.22% in almost 13 days. Bitcoin hash rate: _____  The mining difficulty of Bitcoin is adjusted every two weeks (every 2016 blocks, to be precise) to maintain the normal 10-minute block time. This means that if there are many miners competing amongst themselves and propagating blocks in less than ten minutes, the difficulty of the next puzzle will be increased; if there are few miners and it takes them much longer to find a solution, the difficulty is decreased - both times just enough to keep block times at around 10 minutes. In this case, the previous average block time was close to 12 minutes, so the difficulty dropped on December 18th at around UTC 23.30, to bring block time closer to 10 minutes (still, it's around 11 minutes now). However, not everyone can take advantage of this situation. As reported, only a select few can afford to stay in the game: miners with scale, very specific business models and extremely low electricity costs. At the same time, many other miners are under growing pressure as the bitcoin price dropped by 80% since its all-time high in December of 2017. According to previous reports, between 600,000 and 800,000 Bitcoin miners have pulled the plug on their operations in the second half of November. Earlier in December, market analysis firm Autonomous Research estimated that at least 100,000 individual miners have shut down, and advisory firm Fundstrat Global Advisors added that since early September, about 1.4 million servers have been unplugged.  This flush out took the Bitcoin’s hash rate with it, which, as mentioned above, has started to grow again."
1," Famous venture capital investor and bitcoin enthusiast Tim Draper has invested in bitcoin merchant payment processor OpenNode, the company announced on Tuesday, as it concluded its seed round.  The investment from Draper and his Draper Associates, a seed-stage venture capital firm, totaled USD 1.25 million, according to multiple media reports. “With their backing, we plan to scale the team, build our network, and ultimately, push for hyperbitcoinization [Bitcoin-induced currency demonetization],” the startup added. OpenNode is a bitcoin-only payment processor that aims to enable all kinds of businesses to accept bitcoin payments for everyday items like coffee and groceries via the Lightning Network. The firm has recently launched its re-designed platform to the public, and is right now running a promotion where the platform will be free to use for the first 30 days. After that, the fee for using the payments processor will be 1% of transactions. Over the years, Draper’s company Draper Associates has invested in numerous crypto-related companies, including hardware wallet maker Ledger, fiat-to-crypto exchange Coinbase, and cross-border business transaction service BitPesa, to name a few. Tim Draper has made a name for himself in the crypto community with his highly optimistic bitcoin price predictions. Back in April of this year, he famously predicted that bitcoin would reach USD 250,000 within four years, joking that the “spirits told me.” Although some may think Draper was overly optimistic about bitcoin’s prospects, the investor does have a good track record with his forecasts: In 2014, he correctly predicted that bitcoin would pass USD 10,000 mark in 2017. It appears like Tim Draper is not the only famous billionaire who is still bullish on bitcoin. On Tuesday, former Wall Street banker and current Bitcoin bull Michael Novogratz said during a Bloomberg interview that he expects bitcoin to trade between USD 3,000 and USD 6,000 in the near future, while adding that “hopefully next year we’ll start seeing it move up.” Watch the interview below:"
1," Bitcoin’s (BTC) price crossed key resistance yesterday, boosting the prospects of a stronger rally above $4,000. The leading cryptocurrency by market value broke out of a bearish descending pattern and closed above key resistance at $3,633 yesterday. That came after picking up a strong bid on the anniversary of its 2017 all-time price high on Monday. Tuesday’s close has also pushed up the probability of a bullish three-day close above $3,590 being confirmed on Thursday. So, with the short-term picture looking bullish, the focus shifts to the next major resistance levels lined up at $4,000 (psychological hurdle) and $4,410 (Nov. 29 high). BTC is currently trading at $3,750 on Bitstamp, having clocked a two-week high of $3,776 earlier today. The cryptocurrency has recovered 20 percent from the recent low of $3,122 but is still down 73 percent on a year-to-date basis. BTC’s close above $3,633 on the daily chart bolstered the increasingly bullish technical setup, as represented by the positive divergence of the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) and the high-volume falling wedge breakout. Further evidence that the bears have weakened is a bullish crossover between the 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs).  On the hourly chart, the bull flag breakout confirmed yesterday created room for a rally to $3,840 (pole height added to breakout price). Both the rising trendline and the stacking order of the simple moving averages (SMAs) also favor an extension of the ongoing rally.  The outlook as per the monthly chart would turn bullish if and when prices beat the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month EMA, currently at $5,728.

1," As we wrap up 2018, crypto players are starting to publicly come out with their Bitcoin price forecasts for the new year. Some are bearish, using the fact that BTC was nearing $20 thousand this time last year. Others, however, continue to be bullish. Spencer Bogart of Bitcoin Capital is one of the latter. In a recent interview with CNBC, when asked whether he believes BTC will hit $50,000, Spencer Bogart said yes, but maybe not as soon as bulls are forecasting.  “Absolutely it can go that high,” said Bogart, “how long will it take, I’m not sure.” That’s a different but realistic approach to the future of Bitcoin price, compared to someone like Tom Lee, who reiterated his $15 thousand year-end prediction last month. The crypto market is aware of the downward tumble in the Bitcoin price. However, players remain divided as to what the cause of it was. Was it because Bitcoin was never meant to succeed? Just another Ponzi scheme? Bears may agree. Or, was it because of the individual players buying the digital currency, not being mature enough to learn the ropes before climbing up them? For Spencer Bogart, co-founder of Bitcoin Capital, he is of no opinion. He is simply ignoring the BTC price. Bogart said that if you ignore it, it becomes evident that 2018 has been a “fantastic year” for the digital currency. “This is the first year we have started to move to scale Bitcoin with a lightening network where you can transact extremely quickly and extremely cheaply,” explained Bogart. >> Has Tether Told the Truth All Along? Bank Statements Say 1 For 1 In the CNBC interview, Bogart said: “I think it’s a great buy in opportunity right now.” Does he deny that Bitcoin will probably drop lower? No; “Could we go lower?” Bogart asked, “absolutely.” But that’s what makes it such a great opportunity. “I think anywhere between here and $2,000 and $1,000 is a great buy in opportunity.”  He added that in 24 months, people may look back and say “why didn’t I buy now?” The interviewer didn’t seem to support the idea as much, jokingly responding back saying “I hope so. I hope it’s not more of a question of why did I buy then?” Some people are worried about the Bitcoin price lingering around $3,000, but Spencer Bogart is not one of them. Everyone is different, though. What direction do you think BTC is headed in for the new year? Let us know in the comments below. Featured Image: Depositphotos/ulchik74"
1," American financial services giant Western Union (WU) says they “will be ready” to add cryptocurrencies if crypto garners enough interest as they already boast more than 130 currencies. However, Western Union Global Money Transfer President Odilon Almeida doesn’t think the industry is there yet. In a video published by WU, Almeida considers the company is in the perfect position to benefit from the cryptocurrency movement in the long-term compared to any startup, given that they have “deep knowledge” about international money transfer, as well as millions of users. “Cryptocurrency might become one more option for a way for assets to be exchanged between people and countries. If that happens we would be ready to launch,” he said. He also explains that cryptocurrencies have so far failed to achieve mass adoption because they have yet to master three things: governance, compliance and volatility. However, in his opinion, WU is already better equipped to solve for such variables because it already moves money across 130 currencies and “devotes substantial resources to all of those three challenges.” Blockchain technology, however, does not run into those problems. Almeida makes a distinction between blockchain and cryptocurrencies, saying that the former “has a lot of potential,” adding that, “you’re gonna see more and more ways of using the technology going forward.” The company claims that, “There are many potential applications for the financial services sector, and WU is investing in finding those that best meet our platform,” further clarifying that WU has partnered with Ripple Labs to test whether sending payments by blockchain was faster and less expensive, but that “the tests are ongoing.” “Whenever I’m asked if Western Union will introduce a digital currency, I like to say that we have already done it decades ago,” Almeida said, referring to Western Union’s ability to transfer money digitally. “Western Union is ready today to adopt any kind of currency. We already operate with 130 currencies. If we, one day, feel like it’s the right strategy to introduce cryptocurrencies to our platform, technology-wise, it’s just one more currency.” His opinion resonates with the company’s earlier stance. Back in June, the company’s CEO Hikmet Ersek said WU won't be joining the crypto craze until these currencies become more widely used. As for the supposedly ongoing tests with Ripple Labs, WU has then stated that they had not seen a benefit from Ripple’s technology during a six-month trial period. In the third quarter, WU generated revenue of USD 1.4 billion, which declined 1% compared to the prior year, or increased 3% on a constant currency basis. Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) revenues, which represented 80% of total company revenue in the quarter, were flat on a reported basis, or increased 2% constant currency, while transactions grew 4%. According to WU, geographically, constant currency revenue growth was led by sends originated in Latin America, Europe, and North America, partially offset by declines in the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific."
1," Blockchain technology firm Blockstream announced that they have expanded their satellite service to cover the Asia-Pacific region, as well as adding support for Lightning Network transactions. Their Blockstream Satellite lets users transfer bitcoins through leased satellites, bringing the nascent technology closer to those who might otherwise be impeded in accessing it. As Phase 2 completes worldwide coverage, #BlockstreamSatellite takes #Bitcoin to new heights. Free and private access to Bitcoin #blockchain data is now available to everyone on 🌎. Where will Bitcoin go next? Video made by @Pixelmatic! ⛓️🛰️⚡️🌊🌐🚀🌕 pic.twitter.com/VyEjLRR48X Initially launched in August 2017, the satellite was first available to users from Africa, Europe and the Americas, with the goal to let users access Bitcoin without the need for an internet connection. Now, a new application programming interface (API) lets users send encrypted messages to each other from some of the remotest regions on Earth and pay for those message in bitcoin using the Lightning Network service. The company’s chief strategy officer, Samson Mow, told Forbes, “Bitcoin has always been about uncensorable money, and now we have uncensorable communications as well.”  Blockstream Satellite coverage: Meanwhile, CEO Adam Back added that he expects the new satellite and API to lead to increased development of smartphone and feature phone applications that link together Blockstream’s GreenAddress bitcoin wallet, its Liquid Network for enabling faster transactions between exchanges, and its Cryptocurrency Data Feed for real-time and historical bitcoin exchange data, developed in partnership with the New York Stock Exchange parent company.  Because the entire Bitcoin blockchain will be broadcast, even miners will be able to use the satellite connection for mining: “You could set up a bitcoin mining operation in the middle of the desert powered by solar,”  said Back. “While satellite communications are traditionally cost-prohibitive, Blockstream Satellite will finally allow developers to adopt satellite communications in their applications [...] Natural disaster notifications, secure personal messaging, and sending bitcoin market data to remote locations are just some of the exciting examples of the power of this service,” Chris Cook, head of the Blockstream Satellite project, was quoted as saying in the official announcement by the company. Meanwhile, some members of the cryptoverse just found a way how to use this new opportunity:  Instead of an angel or star on top my Christmas tree this year, I will put a satellite dish pointing to the Blockstream Satellite. Aesthetically pleasing no, practical yes.   However, one needs to build a receiver first, that might cost around USD 139, according to a Blockstream Satellite parts list published on Amazon. Also, on its Github page, the company explains how to set-up this satellite.  Using a peer-to-peer system both for sending funds and communicating, especially during natural disasters, has been the focus of many other projects as well. One of them is Proof of Life, made by a group of developers using a portable hard drive, a solar battery pack, a shortwave radio, and a lot of technical knowledge. This off-grid technology is not just meant to be used for sending cryptocurrencies - it also guarantees the ability to send immutable information all over the world without relying on the grid. For example, victims of disasters could communicate with the outside world, making rescue operations and getting help much more efficient."
1," Despite the year-long bear market in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the 1-year anniversary of Bitcoin’s all-time high was marked by a significant bounce in prices across all major cryptocurrencies. Over the past 24 hours (UTC 07:07 AM), bitcoin was up nearly 8%, while XRP and Ethereum traded up by roughly 16% and 9%, respectively. Strongest among the top 100 digital assets, however, was EOS, which added about a quarter of its price in just 24 hours. December 17, 2018 was the date we remember as the all-time high for the bitcoin price, nearly reaching the milestone USD 20,000 on most exchanges, while surpassing that number on some others. Today – one year later – bitcoin is trading around USD 3,500, after a decline of more than 80%. Top 10 coins today: (UTC 07:05 AM) According to a Bloomberg report on Monday, David Thomas, director and co-founder at crypto brokerage GlobalBlock suggested that major cryptocurrencies have become cheap, saying investors for the first time in a long while are now seeing “value in getting back into the [crypto] market,” and that this seems to be what is driving the market higher now. Meanwhile, Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, reminded that the massive slide in bitcoin value this year may seem unprecedented, ""but in fact, retracements of this magnitude have happened no less than four times in Bitcoin's short history."" ""Because cryptoassets are such a new concept, we are still finding ways to figure out what the value of them should be. All assets in every market go through price discovery, but due to the rapid growth of the crypto industry, this process of price discovery is currently on steroids,"" Greenspan added. CNBC also ran a story on Monday where they reviewed all of the bullish price predictions that were given to bitcoin at its all-time high a year ago. The show host then went on to ask Spencer Bogart, a blockchain venture capitalist, a partner at Blockchain Capital, about his earlier forecast, to which he simply replied that his company is a “long-term venture investor,” although he added that bitcoin “could absolutely” go to USD 50,000, given that bitcoin cannot be valued in the same way as a typical company. Bogart also added that “the fundamentals have not changed” and that “2018 has been a fantastic year for bitcoin” when you ignore the price, pointing to things like the Lightning Network being enabled on bitcoin, professional custody services entering the space, as well as the Yale and Harvard endowments making investments. “I think anywhere between here and 2,000 or 1,000 is just a fantastic buying opportunity. I think when we look back 24 months from now, even 12 months from now, we’re gonna say ‘why didn’t I buy then?’,” Bogard concluded the interview by saying. In a separate tweet Bogart said there are three sources of BTC demand in years ahead:
“1) Generational shift (teenagers want crypto more than cash & gift cards)
2) Central banks & institutions (demand for non-sovereign digital asset w/ absolute scarcity)
3) Programmable money (the opportunities of natively digital money = HUGE)”

1," Bitcoin (BTC) could be in for a stronger recovery rally ahead of New Year as the recent major sell-off looks to be fading. The leading cryptocurrency by market value had been trading near $3,200 early yesterday, representing an 83 percent drop from the record high of $20,000 reached the same date in 2017. However, BTC, which had been ignoring extreme oversold conditions for weeks and struggling to pick up a bid, suddenly jumped to an eight-day high of $3,590 from around 12:00 UTC. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $3,450 on Bitstamp. With the bounce, BTC has not only validated the oversold readings on the 14-week relative strength index (RSI), but also established a bullish reversal pattern on the widely followed three-day chart.  BTC has created a bullish outside reversal candle, meaning the price action seen during the three days to Dec. 17 engulfed the previous three-day candle’s high and low. The candlestick pattern suggests that the time span began pessimistically, but ended on an optimistic note. It is widely considered an early sign of bullish reversal, especially when the pattern appears at the bottom of the downtrend. A bearish-to-bullish trend change, however, would only be confirmed if the current three-day candle ends (Thursday’s UTC close) above $3,590 (high of the bullish outside candle). Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has created a bullish divergence (higher low) in oversold territory below 30.00. Trading volumes have also dropped in the last two weeks, signaling that sellers have run out of steam. As a result of all this, BTC looks likely to rise well above $3,590 ahead of Thursday’s close.  BTC closed on the daily chart yesterday at $3,596, confirming both a falling wedge breakout – a bullish reversal pattern – and a bullish divergence of the 14-day RSI. The 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) have also bottomed out. BTC could therefore attack the recent lower high of $3,633 in the next few days and extend gains toward $4,000.

1," In 2017, the Bitcoin price shot up. The crypto boom was in its prime and BTC, in particular, saw a rise, especially in the second half of December. When this happened, there was a rush to buy the cryptocurrency; then there was a crash. One year later, the BTC price is nowhere near where it was in December 2017.  However, even though we have more Bitcoin bears emerging from the forest, there is some indication that BTC is the same asset and will continue to provide investors with the same shots. In December of 2017, Bitcoin price was flying and almost reached a whopping $20,000. Fast forward a year, things are looking a little different.  At the time of writing, the BTC price is sitting at $3,587.05. Despite the visible price changes in Bitcoin, the crypto market remains divided. There are bears, like Erik Finman, and there are bulls, like Tom Lee, who has maintained his end-of-year outlook, despite the falling market. This week, MarketWatch published an interview with Erik Finman, a teenage Bitcoin millionaire. Going from a 12-year-old who purchased Bitcoin with $1,000 from his grandmother, Finman is now bearish on the digital currency. >> EOS, Litecoin (LTC), and Cardano (ADA) Get a Boost! “Bitcoin is dead,” explained Finman in the interview. “It may have a bull market or two left in it, but long-term, it’s dead.” Not everyone feels this way, though.  Tom Lee, a long-standing crypto bull, announced back in November that he still believes the Bitcoin price will reach $15,000 by the end of 2018. Meanwhile, Matti Greenspan, an eToro senior analyst, thinks Bitcoin may make a comeback. Greenspan also believes the digital currency’s price fluctuations over the last year have no reflection on BTC’s long-term interest. Perhaps one of the most intriguing comments comes from Clement Thibault, an Investing.com senior analyst. Describing the Bitcoin bubble experienced in 2017, Thibault says it was the result of “human greed and short-term thinking.” Thibault adds that BTC hasn’t changed “and it remains the same asset, whether it’s $20,000 or $3,000.” Both the Bitcoin bulls and bears make valid points. Just like with other markets, however, only time will tell the direction that Bitcoin price takes in 2019. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© muratani"
1," Tagomi Holdings Inc, an electronic brokerage offering prime services for cryptocurrency investors, today announced it is live and executing client trades, and that it has received the backing of several notable investors.  The brokerage was co-founded by Greg Tusar, former global head of electronic trading at Goldman Sachs Group, who is working alongside co-founders Jennifer Campbell (CEO), and Marc Bhargava, the company’s president. Tagomi claims it has raised USD 16 million from investors such as Peter Thiel’s (co-founder of PayPal) venture-capital firm, Founders Fund, Collaborative Fund, SV Angel, Digital Currency Group, and others.  The company bills itself as bringing “robust infrastructure and institutional services that sophisticated investors need to trade at scale.” They are not an exchange, however: the company works with digital asset trading venues, OTC desks, and others to execute trades across multiple liquidity venues, their website explains.  “Cryptocurrency trading lacks the transparency and sophisticated execution that top family offices and wealth management firms have come to expect,"" said one of the backers, Joe Lonsdale, Founder of Palantir and Addepar, two American software companies.  “Our focus is on providing our clients, which include financial institutions, high net worth individuals and other sophisticated digital asset investors, a comprehensive solution that eases the operational challenges associated with trading at scale in this emerging asset class.” Campbell was quoted as saying in a press release. Meanwhile, Tusar told Bloomberg that the current environment is challenging, ""but we think there’s a lot of longer-term demand for digital assets and helping clients understand the transformative impact of crypto and blockchain.” Tagomi’s investors generally have a long-term view when it comes to digital assets and cryptocurrencies, said Tusar, adding that the team began building the platform in March.  ""The people we’re engaging so far are still interested and engaged because they see what this technology can do over the long-term,"" Tusar said. The company’s website reiterates their belief that the platform is either for a “sophisticated investor or organization” or “an institution who demands a high level of regulatory compliance.” Investors who want to place orders of USD 10 million for Bitcoin, for example, might be limited if no exchange is able to handle the order. However, Tagomi only takes customers from certain jurisdictions in order to comply with laws and regulations, and requires all customers to go through their compliance on-boarding process."
1," This past week, there was a downward move below USD 3,350 and USD 3,250 in bitcoin. BTC/USD even broke the USD 3,200 support area and tested the USD 3,150 support area. Later, the price recovered and it seems like there could be more upsides above USD 3,300 and USD 3,350 in the coming sessions. Similarly, ethereum price stayed above the USD 80 support and it is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) correcting higher towards the USD 90 and USD 95 resistance levels. Ripple price remained stable and it is currently facing a lot of hurdles near the USD 0.295 and USD 0.300 resistance levels. Total market capitalization  After forming a decent support near USD 3,150, bitcoin price  started an upward move. BTC/USD gained pace above the USD 3,200 level and it is currently trading above USD 3,250. If buyers remain in action, there are chances of more gains above the USD 3,300 and USD 3,350 resistance levels in the near term.
The main weekly resistances are at USD 3,400 and USD 3,500, above which bitcoin will most likely move into a bullish zone. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,200, below which the price could test the weekly support at USD 3,150. Ethereum price  retested the USD 80 support area recently where buyers emerged. ETH/USD is currently moving higher and it seems like it could even break the USD 88 and USD 90 resistances.
However, the key weekly resistance is near the USD 98 - USD 100 zone, which may continue to stop gains in the near term. If there is a successful close above USD 100, the price may move into a medium term bullish trend. Bitcoin cash  declined heavily this past week and broke the USD 100, USD 95 and USD 90 support levels. BCH/USD is currently trading near the USD 80 support, with resistance at USD 85 and USD 90. BCHSV also followed BCH and declined below the USD 80 support. It is currently recovering, but it won’t be easy for buyers to clear the USD 80 and USD 85 resistance levels.
Ripple price  is currently flat near the USD 0.285 support level. To start a solid upward move, XRP/USD must move above the USD 0.295 and USD 0.300 resistance levels. The key weekly support is at USD 0.280, below which there could be a sharp decline. During the past few hours, a few small cap altcoins gained traction and moved up by more than 10%, including R, FCT, ARB, MGO and MOAC. Out of these, revain (R) rallied more than 35% and factom (FCT) is up close to 28%. Overall, bitcoin price seems to be preparing for a short term rebound above USD 3,300. Having said that, BTC/USD must break the USD 3,400 and USD 3,500 resistance levels for a larger recovery in the near term. If there is no positive move above the USD 3,400 level, then bitcoin and altcoins like ethereum, ripple, litecoin, eos, neo and tron are likely to resume bearish moves.

1," Bitcoin (BTC) is still struggling to find the bottom of a bear market on the anniversary of its $20,000 all-time record price high. At press time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at $3,230 on Bitstamp – down 83.5 percent from the record high of $20,000 reached on Dec. 17, 2017. BTC is also down 76 percent on a year-to-date basis (from its opening price of $13,880 on Jan. 1) and is on track to end its three-year winning streak. The picture, however, was remarkably different in the fourth quarter of the last year. The cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid on Nov. 1, 2017, on speculation that the imminent listing of bitcoin futures products on major US exchanges would open the floodgates for institutional money. Back then, BTC was trading above $6,000. Notably, the “fear of missing out” (FOMO) established a self-feeding cycle of more investors joining the party, leading to an even bigger rise in price. By Dec. 17, BTC was trading at $20,000 and was seen rising to dizzy heights this year. Such was the frenzy that Ari Paul, current CIO of Blocktower Capital, purchased 12-month call options with a strike price of $50,000 for $1 million. Call options give holders the right to buy the underlying cryptocurrency at an agreed price on or before a particular date. Paul was essentially betting that BTC would rise to $50,000 by Dec. 28, 2018. The bubble, however, burst in the first quarter of this year and prices have been generally falling ever since. As a result, that now-worthless call option is set to expire next Friday. BTC’s slide from $20,000 to $3,200 could be categorized in the following phases: Sell the fact: BTC closed last year at $13,880 – down 44 percent from the $20,000 high seen on Dec. 17 – possibly due to profit taking on long positions initiated in the run-up to the futures listings. Most experts called it a “sell the fact” scenario and dismissed it as nothing more than a healthy correction. Bubble shrinks: The effects of regulatory clampdowns in China and South Korea weighed heavily over bitcoin’s price early in Q1. Both nations were the biggest sources of demand for cryptocurrencies before the restrictions. Prices subsequently fell to $6,000 on Feb. 6 and closed near $7,000 on Mar. 31. Bear breather: BTC spent a better part of the second quarter and the entire third quarter defending the psychological level of $6,000. Notably, the key support level held ground in the third quarter, despite the decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) to reject BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As a result, experts, including the likes of billionaire investor Novogratz, were convinced that BTC had bottomed out around $6,000. Losses resume: BTC’s inability to produce a notable price bounce despite the repeated defense of $6,000 proved costly. Prices nosedived below the critical 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) support on Nov. 14, signaling a resumption of the sell-off from the record high of $20,000. BTC hit a 15-month low of $3,122 over the weekend and is showing little signs of life below the 21-month EMA. The short-duration, technical charts, however, are signaling scope for a minor price bounce.  The above chart shows BTC’s journey from the record highs a year ago to recent 15-month lows near $3,100. The outlook as per the monthly chart would turn bullish, if and when BTC crosses the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month EMA, currently at $5,719.  BTC’s daily chart shows a “sideways” breach of the falling wedge resistance, meaning the breakout is not convincing. As a result, a more credible evidence of a bullish reversal is needed, possibly in the form a high-volume break above $3,633 (high of the 3-day inverted hammer candle). That could yield a stronger corrective rally to levels above $4,000. BTC/USD long positions on Bitfinex rose to 35,773 BTC earlier today – a level last seen on July 23. More importantly, the longs have risen by 33 percent in the last six days. That could be an indication that bargain hunters are paying heed to extreme oversold conditions reported by the 14-week relative strength index (RSI). BTC, therefore, could witness a corrective bounce ahead of the year’s end. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

0," Bitcoin price is tumbling further today, dashing any hopes of a rally that some felt was certain thanks to current extreme oversold conditions. The world’s largest coin by market cap is currently selling for $3,301.60 USD according to coinmarketcap.com. But earlier today, it fell to $3,200, representing a 15-month low for Bitcoin and not helping bulls’ hopes for a revival. This is the lowest level since September 2017. In the last four weeks alone, Bitcoin has dropped 49% in price. Surely, sellers are exhausted, and Bitcoin is set to turn around. Earlier this week, BTC began moving upwards towards $3,633, but it did not last. The coin’s failure to produce a worthy bounce back despite being extremely oversold indicates that the bears are winning this war and negative sentiment is strong. A 200-week moving average support of $3,170 has been established and now heading below it may be a real possibility for Bitcoin. Across the market, the sentiment is once again bearish. Bitcoin Cash’s recent forks Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin Cash are both two of the biggest losers, with declines of approximately 11% and 14% respectively. It seems the hashrate war between these two coins is doing neither of them any favors. The hard fork happened on November 15th, and the contentious split has caused both coins to lose more than they have gained. Elsewhere, Stellar is down 7.5%, and EOS is down 5%. Ethereum is down 4.5%. >> You Can Earn Bitcoin (BTC) While Shopping with the Lolli App What’s causing the market-wide sell-off? Notably, investors are worried over the fate of a Bitcoin ETF gaining US approval in February. Also the uncertainty of whether or not (or when) this bear sentiment will end, leaves investors’ prospects for short-term Bitcoin price gains at a paltry level. However, some are calling this period one of the “best buying opportunities.” At its current prices, rating agency Weiss is a firm believer that Bitcoin will turn around and now is the time to buy.

0," Do you shop frequently at Sephora? Lululemon? Walmart? If you do, a new in-browser app has emerged and wants to give you Bitcoin (BTC). CoinDesk just reported that the app called Lolli just added Sephora to their list of retailers. Lolli gives shoppers cash back after they make purchases at their list of partnered retailers. The Bitcoin rewards startup told CoinDesk that it recently won over Sephora by data. Around 30 percent of Lolli’s active users are women. “We’ve gone back to a lot of these retailers that previously were not interested but now are coming on-board,” Lolli CEO Alex Adelman told CoinDesk. “One of the biggest ones that just joined us is Sephora, which adds an entire suite of retailers in the beauty category.” Lolli is also partnered with Sephora’s biggest competitor, Ulta. These retailers pay Lolli for customer referrals in fiat currency, which in turn is converted into Bitcoin for rewards in the app. Many crypto-based startup companies have faced vast layoffs this year, due to the bear market. However, Lolli has only six employees and is gaining some traction. >> Crypto Users Increased to 35 Million in 2018: What Will 2019 Bring? Adelman told CoinDesk that Ulta is a huge retailer for the startup company. The tech CEO also claims that men and women alike were consistently requesting Sephora. To earn rewards on Sephora or Ulta, users just have to install the app in their Chrome browser and shop normally. So far, Adelman claims 60 percent of Lolli users become repeat shoppers. Lolli is currently partnered with 500+ popular retailers. You can earn Bitcoin (BTC) through Lolli by shopping online with these major retailers: Barnes & Noble, Overstock, FinishLine, Michaels, Toms, Macy’s, Walmart, CVS Pharmacy, Lululemon, Groupon, and VRBO. The Bitcoin startup was launched back in September of 2018, and it has raised $2.35 million so far. On average, Lolli pays out $10 per purchase in BTC.

0," Famous Bitcoin bull Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, is staying optimistic in spite of everything. In a note on Thursday, he said that Bitcoin’s current price of USD 3,400 is wrong because its actual fair market value is between USD 13,800 and USD 14,800, given the number of active wallet addresses, usage per account and factors influencing supply. (The second part of the article updated with a commentary from Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro.) Although hisinitial prediction was for Bitcoin to reach USD 25,000 by the end of 2018, he amended that to a range of USD 20,000 - USD 22,000. When the market started getting more bearish, his prediction went down to around USD 15,000 as he stated the price would triple by the end of the year. Now, this divergence of more than four times the current price can be explained by last year’s meteoric rally, a “meltdown” in the macroeconomic climate and treasury sales during initial coin offerings, he believes. “Fair value is significantly higher than the current price of Bitcoin,” he wrote in his note, reported by Bloomberg, adding, “In fact, working backwards, to solve for the current price of Bitcoin, this implies crypto wallets should fall to 17 million from 50 million currently.”  As reported, Chris Burniske, author of the popular book on cryptoassets, and partner of venture firm Placeholder, also believes that the fundamentals of Bitcoin and Ethereum networks have not fallen as much as prices have. Moreover, the number of verified cryptoasset users climbed from 18 million to 35 million this year, almost doubling, all in the first three quarters of 2018.  Meanwhile, Lee claims that user adoption is the key to Bitcoin’s price boom: if Bitcoin wallets approach just 7 percent of Visa’s 4.5 billion account holders, fair value would be USD 150,000 per Bitcoin according to his model, he believes - and he refuses to update his forecast for the end of the year. The community is pretty divided in reaction to his forecast.  Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, reacted in a daily commentary:  ""In my personal philosophy, the market is never wrong. Fair value is what someone is willing to pay for it. I can understand how using metrics to try and determine what the price of an asset should be can be helpful. However, if nobody is willing to pay that amount, then it isn't the correct value."" According to him, ""Thomas even went as far as trying to reverse engineer his own calculations showing how given the current price of bitcoin, there should be far fewer active wallets. This thinking sounded a bit silly to me as well."" ""Sure, I believe that bitcoin can grow in value very quickly. After all, there is an extremely limited supply. But for that to happen demand needs to pick up first,"" Greenspan added. However, there are those that want to believe Lee: He's a super nice, interesting guy but he's dead wrong currently on both equities and bitcoin. While Reddit user u/lazyhippopotamus writes, “It's obvious. The market is definitely being manipulated heavily, and we're the ones losing money over it.” However, people in this club are few and far between, with many more taking to ridiculing the Bitcoin bull over all his forecasts. “Isn't the market always right and can't only people predicting it be wrong?” asks u/Frag1le, while u/SacrificesForMoloch writes, “The dude who has been wrong all year is saying the market is wrong... Yah OK. Don't listen to these charlatans.” The majority of the community on Twitter shares this opinion: user @Salt_Water_Croc says, “Even a noob who joined market yesterday can predict better and closer price to reality. What an idiot this #TomLee is.” Price predictions for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a dime a dozen, since pretty much everyone can make a prediction that might come true in such a volatile market. As data analyst Nick Maggiulli put it, “Where did all these people go wrong? When they made a Bitcoin price prediction in the first place. You CANNOT predict chaotic systems.” Meanwhile, New York-based research company Delphi Digital estimates that the price of Bitcoin may go up in 2019, after bottoming out in the first quarter of the year."
0," Companies in English-speaking countries all over the world have reportedly received bomb threats from people claiming to have planted explosive devices in recipients’ buildings – which they will only refrain from detonating should they receive USD 20,000 in Bitcoin. Police forces across the United States say they have received multiple reports of emailed threats, with similar announcements made in New Zealand. However, numerous police spokespeople have already called the threats a “hoax.” And it seems any would-be scammers have so far failed utterly in their efforts – with zero transactions recorded in the scammers’ wallet the time of writing (UTC 05:50 AM). __ Dammit, I guess I sent it to the wrong address. However, the apparent scam has succeeded in causing widespread disruption, though, particularly in the United States and Canada. Media organizations including Pennsylvanian local newspaper the Tribune-Democrat, software companies and government buildings in both countries were all evacuated as police were called out to investigate claims. In some emails, the apparent scammers claimed they would only “call off” their “man” if the recipients made a Bitcoin transfer. Internet users have claimed that the threats can be traced to a server in Moscow, while some versions of the email threat published online appear to be written in somewhat poorly worded or broken English, although there appears to be little concrete evidence to suggest there are any clear leads in the case yet. The text of the scam email: Subject: Do not waste your time
Hello. My man hid an explosive device (Hexogen) in the building where your business is conducted. My mercenary assembled the explosive device according to my guide.

0," Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled to 15-month lows earlier today, dashing hopes of a rally signaled by current extreme oversold conditions. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell to $3,200 on Bitstamp at 00:15 UTC – the lowest level since September 2017. BTC was trapped in a five-day-long narrowing price range 24 hours ago and showed signs that it might break upwards with a strong move toward the crucial resistance at $3,633. These bullish expectations were based largely on a premise that the sellers are facing exhaustion, as indicated by the 14-week relative strength index (RSI), having engineered a 49 percent price drop in the last four weeks. Further, evidence of bargain hunting had emerged earlier this week in the form of a three-day inverted hammer candle. Even so, BTC dived out of the narrowing price range in U.S. trading hours yesterday, killing the prospects of a short-term inverted hammer bullish reversal above $3,633. BTC’s persistent failure to produce a notable price bounce despite extreme oversold conditions indicates that the bearish sentiment is very strong. As a result, a convincing break below the 200-week moving average (MA) support of $3,170 cannot be ruled out. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $3,250 on Bitstamp, representing a 2 percent decline on a 24-hour basis. The symmetrical triangle breakdown seen in the 4-hour chart indicates a resumption of the sell-off from the Nov. 29 high of $4,410. The stacking order of the 50-candle moving average (MA), below the 100-candle MA, below the 200-candle SMA, is a classic bear indicator. The RSI has also fallen back into bearish territory below 50.00. BTC, therefore, risks falling to the psychological level of $3,000. On the way lower, it may encounter support at $3,179 (200-week MA).  As seen above, BTC has charted lower price highs (marked by arrows) along the downward sloping 10-day exponential moving average (EMA). Notably, BTC persistently failed to close above that EMA hurdle at the end of the last month. Hence, the 10-day EMA, currently at $3,465, is the level to beat for the bulls.

0," A market manipulation tactic called wash trading makes up over 80% of the Coinmarketcap top 25 Bitcoin pairs volume, a new report claims. The actual volume of most of these pairs is under 1% of their reported volume, and only two of the top 25 BTC pairs, listed on Binance and Bitfinex, do not suffer from this. A wash trade is a form of market manipulation in which an investor simultaneously sells and buys the same financial instruments to create misleading, artificial activity in the marketplace. The report, done by the Blockchain Transparency Institute (BTI,) a group of blockchain data researchers and enthusiasts, claims that the biggest offender is the OKEx exchange, as the team claims that it found almost all of their top 30 traded tokens to be engaging in wash trading when processed through their algorithms.  However, even the estimated adjusted volume for them would still keep them in the top 10 exchanges. Some other mentioned exchanges are Huobi, HitBTC and Bithumb, the latter reportedly engaging in wash trading primarily with Monero, Dash, Bitcoin Gold, and ZCash and changing those pairs monthly. Top 25 BTC trading pairs on Coinmarketcap: This manipulation tactic is dangerous for any aspiring token projects, as they pay exorbitant fees to be listed on exchanges that they believe hold a large trading volume and might offer high liquidity. The report adds that the average project spent over USD 50,000 this year in listing fees in order to add their tokens on exchanges which practice wash trading, and this adds up to an estimated USD 100 million only in 2018. They add, “With over 50 exchanges wash trading over 95% of their volumes, this is a 500K a year scheme, with some exchanges making over one million dollars this year just from collecting these fees.” Top 25 BTC trading pairs by BTI: The fake trading volume issue is a long-standing one in the cryptocurrency world. Aside from wash trading, some exchanges engage in other manipulative behavior such as transaction mining, where they return a portion of the trading fees paid by users when they place orders on the exchange in the form of the exchange’s own token. In some extreme cases, users can receive tokens worth more than the trading fee they paid, essentially earning free money by generating buy and sell orders on the exchange. Users then follow up and often run trading algorithms designed to generate a large number of orders, inflating the trading volume on the exchange. Among partners and supporters of the Blockchain Transparency Institute are Messari, a crypto intelligence firm, Deepesh Chaudhari, MIT data scientist, Bitwise, a crypto investment company, and others."
0," The past few sessions were mostly neutral for bitcoin as it continues to trade in a range with a bearish angle below USD 3,450. BTC/USD is struggling to rebound, which might result in a strong bearish reaction below USD 3,350 or USD 3,300 in the coming sessions. Similarly, ethereum price failed to surpass the USD 95 and USD 100 resistance levels on a couple of occasions. Ripple price is stuck just above USD 0.300 and below USD 0.310. Therefore, bitcoin and altcoins could either start a decent rebound soon or they might breakdown to new yearly lows. Total market capitalization  There were mostly range moves below the USD 3,450 resistance level in bitcoin price . BTC/USD seems to be struggling (UTC 08:20 AM) near the USD 3,450 and USD 3,500 resistances. A successful close above the USD 3,500 barrier could clear the path for buyers to take control in the near term.
If buyers continue to fail near the USD 3,450 and USD 3,500 resistances, there could be a strong bearish reaction. A break below the USD 3,350 level may perhaps accelerate losses towards the USD 3,300 or USD 3,220 levels. Ethereum price  failed recently near the USD 91 level and declined below USD 90. ETH/USD is currently consolidating just above USD 88, with resistances near the USD 91, USD 94, USD 96 and USD 98 levels. 
If there is no break above the stated levels and USD 100, the price might decline to USD 80 or even USD 75. A break above USD 100 could improve the market sentiment in favor of buyers. Bitcoin cash price  extended declines below the USD 98 support level. BCH/USD is down more than 1% and it is currently near USD 95. The main support is at USD 92, followed by USD 90. BCHSV is down around 5% and it is currently trading near the USD 85 support. If the price continues to slide, there could be a test of USD 80.
Ripple price  remained confined in a tight range above the USD 0.300 support. XRP/USD must surpass the USD 0.308 and USD 0.310 resistance levels to gain bullish momentum. If not, the price may drop significantly to USD 0.280 or USD 265. During the past few hours, a few small cap altcoins gained bullish momentum and jumped more than 10%, including BTCP, PAY, DEX, QTUM and WAVES. Out of these, BTCP rallied around 14% and PAY climbed close to 13%. The current price action is slightly bearish for bitcoin below USD 3,450. If BTC/USD continues to struggle, there is a high possibility of a breakdown below USD 3,350 and USD 3,300 in the near term. Conversely, if there is an upside break above USD 3,450 and USD 3,500, bitcoin and altcoins such as ethereum, ripple, eos and litecoin may stage a solid comeback.

0," Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating below $3,500 for the third day straight. The challenge now is to gauge whether the bulls or the bears will win out in the coming days. As discussed yesterday, the leading cryptocurrency could soon see a corrective rally if prices manage to clear the crucial resistance at $3,633 (the high of an “inverted hammer” candle on the 3-day chart) by Friday’s UTC close. The bull case is also bolstered by bitcoin’s 14-week relative strength index, which is reporting oversold conditions for the first time since January 2015. A corrective rally, therefore, looks overdue. The odds of a move above $3,633 would rise if BTC’s five-day-long narrowing price range ends with a bullish breakout. As of writing, the upper edge of the price range is located at $3,456 and the lower edge is seen at $3,360. However, it’s worth remembering that BTC has repeatedly struggled to score a significant and lasting rally in recent weeks, despite the very oversold conditions. BTC is currently trading at $3,400 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.75 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  BTC has created a symmetrical triangle (narrowing price range) on the hourly chart. A bull breakout would validate the argument put forward by the 3-day inverted hammer candle that bargain hunters are beginning to challenge the bears’ resolve to push prices lower. As a result, the triangle breakout, if confirmed, could yield a quick move higher to $3,633. BTC, however, risks falling to the 200-week moving average (MA) of $3,179 if prices pierce the triangle support of $3,360. That long-term MA support will likely hold ground, as the 14-week RSI is reporting extreme oversold conditions.  Many market technicians believe that a break of an RSI trendline often precedes the break of a trendline in price. Going by that logic, the falling channel breakout in the 6-hour chart RSI could be considered an advance warning of an impending bullish price move.

1," Recently, there was a downside extension in bitcoin price below the USD 3,440 and USD 3,400 support levels. BTC/USD tested the USD 3,325 level and later started consolidating in a range above USD 3,350. Ethereum price also declined and traded below the USD 90 support. However, the price remained above the USD 84 low and it is currently (UTC 08:10 AM) attempting a recovery towards USD 94. On the other hand, ripple price was stable and dips below USD 0.300 were well supported. The current technical structure suggests range trading before bitcoin makes the next move. Total market capitalization  There were further declines below the USD 3,440 level in bitcoin price . BTC/USD even broke the USD 3,400 support and traded towards the USD 3,300 level. It found support neat the USD 3,325 level and later the price corrected a few points. 
The price is currently trading just below the USD 3,400 level, above which there are chances of a recovery towards the USD 3,450 level. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,350 followed by USD 3,325. If there are more losses, the price may trade to a new yearly low below USD 3,225. Ethereum price  struggled to recover above the USD 94 and USD 95 resistance levels. ETH/USD declined further and it traded below the USD 90 level.
Buyers appeared near the USD 87 - USD 88 zone and the price is currently consolidating losses. On the upside, an initial hurdle is near the USD 92 level, above which the price may rise towards the USD 95 level. Bitcoin cash price  failed to stay above the USD 100 support and it recently declined around 3%. BCH/USD is currently trading near the USD 96 level, with an immediate support at USD 95 followed by USD 92. BCHSV declined below the USD 90 support recently before buyers appeared near the USD 85 level. It is currently recovering, but it may face sellers near USD 90 or USD 92.
Ripple price  dipped below the USD 0.300 support level, but it quickly recovered. XRP/USD is currently up around 0.5% and it may climb towards the USD 0.308 and USD 0.314 resistance levels. Despite bearish moves in bitcoin, a few small cap altcoins climbed higher by more than 10%, including DEX, CREDO, WAVES, XTZ, REP and PAY. Out of these, DEX rallied around 45% and CREDO climbed close to 36%. Overall, bitcoin seems to be trading in a range below USD 3,500 with a bearish angle. BTC/USD must climb above the USD 3,450 and USD 3,500 resistance levels to start a solid recovery. If not, there is a risk of more declines below USD 3,300 and USD 3,200 in the coming sessions. Similarly, ethereum could decline below USD 84 and USD 80 if it continues to fail near the USD 95 and USD 100 resistance levels.

1," Bitcoin’s (BTC) struggle to build a notable bounce could end if prices beat key resistance above $3,600. The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell to 15-month lows near $3,200 last week, pushing the 14-week relative strength index (RSI) below 30.00 for the first time since 2015. So, with bitcoin so extremely oversold, a recovery rally cannot be ruled out – more so because there is evidence of bargain hunters challenging the bears’ resolve to push prices lower. For instance, BTC posted a three-day candle on Dec. 8 that closed below support at $3,463 (low of multiple three-day candles in September 2017), bolstering the already bearish technical setup. Despite that, BTC not only avoided a drop to $3,000 in the last 72 hours but also hit a high of $3,633, if briefly. Nevertheless, the fact that prices were able to defy the bearish setup indicates that the bulls are beginning to flex a little muscle. Therefore, a stronger rally could unfold if prices manage to cross the newfound resistance of $3,633 in the next 48 hours or so. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,414 on Bitstamp, having clocked a low of $3,325 earlier today.  As seen above, bitcoin has charted an “inverted hammer” candle, which occurs when prices see a brief rally during a downtrend. It is widely considered a sign of potential trend reversal. The bullish reversal, however, would be confirmed if the follow-through is positive, that is, the current 3-day candle needs to close above $3,633 on Friday. That could see prices open up upside toward the psychological resistance of $4,000.  On the daily chart, the 14-day RSI has posted a higher low as opposed to the lower low on price, meaning the indicator is diverging in favor of the bulls. However, again, a high-volume move above $3,633 is needed to confirm a short-term bullish reversal. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

0," The price of Bitcoin may go up in 2019, after bottoming out in the first quarter of the year, shows a new paper by New York-based research company Delphi Digital. The bottom might well happen in the first half of Q1 due to the recent acceleration in Bitcoin’s downward trend. They also believe that the Lightning Network’s success could prove crucial to wider Bitcoin usage.  The research paper, titled “The State of Bitcoin,” found that the primary source of selling in the most recent downturn for Bitcoin came from coin owners who have been holding for 3 to 5 years, and these very same HODLers seem close to exhausting their selling efforts. This is derived from UTXO (unspent transaction output) trends, which the paper says “have shown to be an impressively reliable predictor, albeit with a limited sample history, for price bottoms, future accumulation timing, and UTXO wave amplitudes.” The UTXO trend and subsequent price appreciation should line up with the Bitcoin block mining reward halving that is set to happen in 2020, when the reward will decrease from 12.5 to 6.25 bitcoins, but the research team believes that this will be the last reward halving to have a very significant impact on price. Block mining reward halving occurs once every 210,000 blocks, which translates to around once every four years. Historically, there have been two halvings: in 2012 and 2016, both of which were followed by significant bull runs.  Block mining reward halving and Bitcoin price chart: ____ The short-term outlook in the paper draws a parallel to 2013: back then, when the prices peaked in late 2013 and subsequently fell, they continued to slip even after year-over-year returns turned negative. It was roughly a year before Bitcoin returned to similar price levels. The price’s rise of late 2017 mimics that of 2013, as peak valuations were followed by an extended bear market, characterized by multiple relief rallies on the way to drastically lower prices, but the bottom does not seem to be too far off.  In the long run, Bitcoin may well replace offshore accounts as the means to holding private wealth. Once Bitcoin rises in popularity for this reason, more conservative institutions (central banks, state and local pension funds, etc.) are likely to follow suit as they become more comfortable with digital assets, the paper claims. The researchers remain optimistic, however: “Barring any major disruptions to its network, however, over the long run we foresee Bitcoin serving as a staple allocation in traditional investment portfolios, central bank reserves, and as a suitable alternative for a portion of assets held in offshore accounts.” But in order to be used as a currency, Bitcoin still has quite a way to go. “In order for Bitcoin to work as a medium of exchange, we believe it first needs to establish itself as a store of value to help reduce its volatility,” the paper states, adding that the current volatility of the asset makes it less likely for holders to spend it, as they believe it might become worth more in the future, and eliminating this possibility could be the nudge Bitcoin needs towards becoming a medium of exchange. ""If Lightning Network succeeds, it will enable Bitcoin to have nearly instant transactions and fees at potentially a fraction of a cent. This opens the door for fast micropayments where users could pay a penny to read an article or receive small tips from fans on social media. This provides unique advantages over the current web based payments infrastructure which is saddled with middle-men, delays in settlement, and high transaction fees,"" according to Delphi Digital."
0," There was an increase in selling pressure on bitcoin recently, resulting in a bearish move below USD 3,450. BTC/USD is currently (UTC 08:10 AM) trading near the USD 3,400 support level and it seems to be struggling near the USD 3,500 and USD 3,550 resistance levels. Ethereum clearly struggled to clear the USD 95 and USD 100 resistance levels. ETH/USD is currently trading below USD 90 and it may slide towards USD 85. Ripple price continues to consolidate near the USD 0.300 support, with an immediate resistance at USD 0.312. The price action is short term bearish unless bitcoin price breaks the USD 3,500 and USD 3,550 resistances in the coming sessions. Total market capitalization  There was a rejection noted near the USD 3,550 level in bitcoin price , resulting in a downward move. BTC/USD declined below the USD 3,450 support and it is currently down around 2%. An immediate support is at USD 3,400, below which the price could drop sharply towards the USD 3,250 support level.
On the flip side, if buyers continue to protect USD 3,400, there is a chance of an upward move towards the USD 3,500 level. However, the price must convincingly break the USD 3,500 and USD 3,550 resistance levels to stage a decent rebound in the near term. Ethereum price  is currently consolidating near the USD 88 - USD 90 area. ETH/USD was recently rejected near the USD 100 hurdle (the previous support zone).
If there are more losses below USD 88, the price may revisit the last swing low near USD 84. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 94, above which the price may retest the key USD 98 - USD 100 resistance zone. Bitcoin cash price  is down around 2.5% and it moved below the USD 100 support. It seems like BCH/USD may continue to correct lower towards the USD 95 support level. BCHSV is down more than 6% and it seems like buyers failed to hold gains above the USD 100 and USD 95 support levels. The next key support awaits near USD 90, below which the price may decline to USD 85.
Ripple price  is facing a solid resistance near the USD 0.312 and USD 0.320 levels. XRP/USD is currently consolidating above USD 0.300 and it may continue to trade in a range before the next move either above USD 0.320 or below USD 0.300. A few small cap altcoins declined more than 8% recently, including MOAC, FCT, MANA, DCR, ELF, R, MGO and KMD. Out of these, MOAC is down around 17% and FCT fell close to 13%. To sum up, bitcoin buyers seem to be facing a major resistance near the USD 3,500 and USD 3,550 levels. If BTC/USD fails to climb above USD 3,550, there is a chance of a fresh decline below USD 3,400 and 3,350 in the near term. Similarly, ethereum and ripple may decline heavily if they fail to move past USD 100 and USD 0.320 respectively.

0," There are possible signs that investors in Turkey, a country with population of 80 million people, may be turning their backs on the lira – and buying cryptocurrencies instead. Slate cites a study by Turkish researcher Twentify, which found that around 1 in 5 respondents said they had begun trading in cryptocurrencies after August this year, when the lira took a massive tumble in price. (However, since then it has recovered by 26% against the dollar.) Inflation in the country also remains high (21.62% year-on-year in November), another factor that has led investors to seek out ways to protect the value of their savings. Reuters reports that Turkish economic growth has “dwindled to 1.6% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2018” – down from 7% in 2017. TRY/USD chart: ____ Per a report in Turkish media outlet DHA, trading on certain Turkish crypto exchanges increased by 37% in November, peaking at a weekly increase of 72% in the week beginning November 12. However, the whole crypto market saw higher trading volumes in November due to huge sell off.  Meanwhile, Slate quotes Emin Gün Sirer, a Turkish-American professor at Cornell University, who says the country’s “relatively young population compared [to the rest of] Europe, and [their] flexible adoption of new technology provide the conditions for an eager market for cryptocurrency.” In a column for Hürriyet Daily News, journalist and business expert Ersu Ablak stated, “It makes me happy that the latest cryptocurrency investments involve Turkey [...] This is partly due to the fact that Turkish people are very adaptable to new technologies and new methods.” The country’s chief religious body, the Directorate of Religious Affairs, has previously ruled that cryptocurrency use is not permissible under Islamic law, but State author Sara Nasser concludes that, nonetheless, “cryptocurrency is an attractive, but risky dream” for many Turks. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, recently interacted with Turkish crypto-enthusiasts on Twitter, expressing his surprise at the size of the country’s crypto-community. Istanbul will also host one of the AME region’s biggest blockchain and cryptocurrency-themed forums, the Blockchain Economy Summit, in February next year. ____

0," A key long-term bitcoin (BTC) price indicator is reporting oversold conditions for the first time in almost four years. The widely followed 14-week relative strength index (RSI), which oscillates between zero to 100, is currently seen at 29.80 – a level last seen in January 2015. An asset or a cryptocurrency is considered to be oversold if the RSI is holding below 30.00. On the other hand, an above-70 reading indicates overbought conditions. Essentially, the under-30 reading on the 14-week RSI indicates that the recent heavy selling from the highs above $6,200 may have reached a point of exhaustion. As a result, BTC may defend the immediate support at $3,179 (200-week moving average) in the short-run. Many experts also believe that RSI’s drop below 30.00 is followed by a strong corrective bounce. That’s not necessarily true as some markets enter into very strong trends, in which case the RSI can stay oversold or overbought for prolonged periods of times. Notably, BTC’s ongoing bear market is looking quite resilient, as the sell-off is backed by strong volumes. Hence, a strong bounce could remain elusive for some time, despite the oversold readings on the 14-week RSI. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,390 on Bitstamp, representing a 2.3 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  The RSI dropped below the key support of 53.00 on the weekly chart in late January, signaling a bullish-to-bearish trend change. As of now, it’s holding in oversold territory below 30.00. It is worth noting that RSI’s January 2015 drop below 30.00 was short-lived and BTC soon picked up a bid in response to the oversold conditions.  On the daily chart, the immediate outlook remains bearish as long as BTC is trading below the descending trendline. BTC failed to cut through the diagonal resistance yesterday, adding credence to the bearish setup on the 3-day chart. So too, do the 5- and 10-day MAs which are trending south.

0," While many traders eagerly await a potential bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), some of the cryptocurrency’s most passionate advocates are lukewarm at best about the prospect of such an instrument. Twitter is flush with users like crypto entrepreneur Jonathan Hamel posting about how an ETF would bring an “epic” inflow of institutional capital to the ecosystem – that is, “billions” of dollars in new investments. But if you talk to early adopters and veteran technologists in the bitcoin community, you’ll hear resounding indifference, if not queasiness. “I don’t think an ETF is going to be some kind of massive magnet,” Pierre Rochard, founder of the Brooklyn-based Bitcoin Advisory LLC, told CoinDesk. “Demand will continue to be driven by sentiment, rather than the availability of specific products.” Last week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange postponed plans to reevaluate ETF proposals from financial institutions such as VanEck and SolidX to as late as February 27, 2019. This means two more months of nail-biting for those who believe the ETF would be a huge boon to bitcoin or the savior of the overall crypto marketplace. And yet, in reference to Grayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust, which launched in 2015, bitcoin analyst Nik Bhatia told CoinDesk: “I don’t see the additional ETFs improving bitcoin’s liquidity any more than the GBTC already does.” Although Bhatia said he would nevertheless welcome a regulator-approved ETF because it might increase public trust in this new asset class, some crypto veterans went as far as to say an ETF could actually be harmful to the broader ecosystem. To them, an ETF contradicts the vision of a peer-to-peer financial network fueled by self-custodied assets. “It’s kind of a centralizing force and the value proposition of bitcoin is it’s decentralized, global,” Lightning Labs developer Alex Bosworth told CoinDesk. For Bosworth, the biggest risk that a bitcoin ETF presents is that it might incentivize institutions to work collectively to influence the ecosystem. Referring to the thwarted New York Agreement in 2017 – when leading crypto companies planned to support unpopular bitcoin network updates simultaneously despite public outcry – Bosworth explained: “We saw companies that are custodians for other people’s coins, talking as if they hold those coins and take actions that decide, on behalf of their users, without even consulting them…We don’t want to have central parties out there negotiating for fundamental rule changes in bitcoin.” This is the same reason that bitcoin veteran Christopher Allen, the former principal architect at Blockstream, distrusts the institutions that are working to create a regulated bitcoin ETF. “The real reason they are doing it is they can play financial games to make them a much higher interest rate than what they would otherwise,” Allen told CoinDesk. “I think there are a lot of implications of that. How do we educate people on what fiduciary responsibility and custody really is?” Bhatia agreed that the industry is transitioning to prioritize a “trusted custody model,” but doesn’t think such institutional products will have a significant impact on cypherpunk traditionalists. “People that currently store their own bitcoin aren’t going to rush into the ETF because they’re not looking for the same things,” he said. Other bitcoin veterans are concerned retail investors are putting more faith in an ETF’s ability to rescue sinking cryptocurrency prices than the prospective product actually deserves. If approved in the near future, Rochard said, he expects bitcoin ETFs would make up an even smaller percentage of the market than gold ETFs, which he estimated represent less than 2 percent of the global gold supply. “We’re talking about a very niche part of the market that would be interested in a bitcoin ETF product,” Rochard said. “It would be even less than gold is used in an ETF because the overall settlement cost of bitcoin is lower than those of physically settling gold.” Others say any boost to the price might be short-lived. During CoinDesk’s Consensus: Invest conference in November, BlockTower Capital’s chief investment officer Ari Paul warned the audience to recall how the addition of bitcoin futures boosted short-term speculation far more than institutional commitment. The price settled back down within months. “If an ETF was launched, it’s not that there would suddenly be massive institutional flows. I think on the announcement you’d get a massive rally,” Paul said. “That’s not because you suddenly get $50 million [in] institutional investors’ money, it’s because speculators price it in.” And it’s important to remember that any euphoria (or anxiety) about a bitcoin ETF is still academic. On December 5, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce told the audience during fireside chat in Washington D.C. not to “hold your breath,” because a regulator-approved bitcoin ETF could still be years away. She added: “I do caution people to not live or die on when a crypto or bitcoin ETF gets approved.” Even if an ETF were to be approved, bitcoin advocates question how this structure – in which a fund owns underlying assets and divides ownership of them into shares – would address the idiosyncrasies of cryptocurrency. For example, what if there’s another fork of the network, like the one that create bitcoin cash last year? “Do they [ETF custodians] give the coins back to people or do they suddenly become an index fund?” Rochard said. “I don’t think there’s a precedent at all [from capital markets], because bitcoin doesn’t have a legal identity and corporations do.” Allen said ETF issuers would need to clarify how they store and tally their bitcoin, so that products representing this underlying assets wouldn’t be loaned out over and over in a process called rehypothecation. As Caitlin Long, co-founder of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, wrote in a Forbes column, rehypothecation is antithetical to the bitcoin ethos because there is a finite bitcoin supply, 21 million at max. As such, there’s no way to bail out lenders if borrowers were owed more bitcoin than the ETF-issuer actually possessed. “Substantively, it’s really not that much different than fractional reserve banking,” Rochard said. However, Gabor Gurbacs, the director of digital asset strategy for VanEck, told CoinDesk his company’s proposal would involve cold storage, daily disclosures to defuse any concerns about rehypothecation, and a handbook of regulator-approved index fund procedures to follow in the case of a bitcoin fork. “We intend to stay true to the core tenets of bitcoin,” Gurbacs said, adding that ETF holders would be primarily exposed to the asset defined by Bitcoin Core unless another chain became dominant and equally secure. “I don’t see any operational issues. I think we’ve figured it out and we’re waiting for the regulators to make a decision on this,” he went on to explain. Like many bitcoin advocates, Rochard said that anything which boosts bitcoin’s overall liquidity – even modestly – is a good thing. On the other hand, he sympathized with the skeptical indifference many technologists feel toward financial institutions. “It would be really unfortunate if people lose sight of why bitcoin has value,” Rochard said. “But it would be such a small part of the market, so there’d be limited impact on that.” Businessman on dart board image via Shutterstock"
0," Everyone has their own guess as to what Bitcoin will be worth in any amount of time. However, some predictions garner special attention: for example, software tycoon John McAfee first said Bitcoin would reach USD 500,000 by the end of 2020 and promised he’d eat his external genitalia on national television if that doesn’t happen, later amending his prediction to say it’d go up to USD 1 million while the previous promise still stands. Because this is the internet, there is a website that follows McAfee’s prediction and measures how much Bitcoin would have to rise for McAfee’s nethers to stay intact. Also, the website, called bircoin.top, lets you add your own parameters to see how your own prediction would pan out, or even check other famous predictions.  __ McAfee announced his prediction on July 17th, 2017, and according to mathematics, the price would need to grow at a rate of around 0.5% per day from that day on to reach the predicted million. Although half a percent may not sound like much, it is still an exponential growth curve that gets steeper the further it goes. With this steady growth rate, Bitcoin would have to be worth USD 26,400 today for it to be on track for the end of 2020 - but it is scarcely above USD 3,500, around 86% less than what the prediction needs, or around 416 days behind. And there are many predictions: from Tom Lee, of Fundstrat Advisors, expecting USD 15,000 per bitcoin by the end of 2018, to Tim Draper betting on USD 250,000 per bitcoin by 2022. Meanwhile, data analyst Nick Maggiulli says that their mistake was making a prediction in the first place. “You CANNOT predict chaotic systems,” he adds in a tweet. Where did all these people go wrong?   When they made a Bitcoin price prediction in the first place. You CANNOT predict chaotic systems.  It’s the Three Body Problem. pic.twitter.com/IeMJQ761Sw Co-founder of first Chinese cryptocurrency exchange BTCC, Bobby Lee, took to Twitter to share his own opinion and ask the community to do the same. If history repeats perfectly, then the current bear market for #Bitcoin would bottom out at $2,500 next month, in Jan 2019.And then the next rally would start in late 2020, peak out in Dec 2021 at $333,000, and then crash back down to $41,000 in Jan 2023.Something like that?🙂 https://t.co/M8ljIVnt73 Later, Lee asked his followers whether this will happen - 59% of respondents believe in this, by the way, and over half believe that the peak of USD 333,000 is the least likely to happen out of all four predictions. However, all this proves is that anyone can make predictions. The community has always been skeptical, however, and many predictions (and the people making them) are notoriously wrong. Still, if you’re craving some fun, make your own prediction - there are no prerequisites to it - and if you get something right, maybe you’ll get famous."
0," The fundamentals of Bitcoin and Ethereum networks have not fallen as much as prices have, author of the popular book Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond, Chris Burniske, writes in a blog post. In his research, he found that the fundamentals are outperforming the prices currently, although all of them are down since December 2017 and January 2018. Although there are many who do not believe cryptocurrency networks have any fundamentals at all, Burniske believes that this role is filled by health of the supply-siders and demand-siders. Supply-siders are those who provision the network’s service, in most cases miners, and demand-siders are the ones who consume the service. The research focuses on Bitcoin and Ethereum, comparing how fundamentals and network values have performed since December 17th, 2017, and January 13th, 2018 - the peak network values for both.  What he found is that, although network values (“Network Value” = “Price per Unit” x “Units of the Cryptoasset Outstanding”) were down, the number of daily transactions as well as demand for their native functionality is not following suit. Hash rates, or processing power of a cryptocurrency network, of both are up compared to their peaks; although they are on negative slopes, they are still outperforming the price. Another supply-side component are developers, and Burniske writes that according to the internal analysis of venture firm Placeholder, of which he is a partner, those metrics are also outperforming the market. “Most asset classes have widely agreed-upon models to value them; analysts just bicker over the inputs to those models. In crypto, we currently bicker over both the models and the inputs, hence the insane whiplash of the markets,” Burniske concludes, adding that the growth of network fundamentals is sure to attract analysts which, in turn, will help stabilize the market. In reply to Burniske’s tweet featuring his article, the crypto community points out that taking the peak values from the December 17 - January 18 time frame means assuming that the market priced network value correctly back then. My main issue with your analysis, and I may be missing something obvious here, but - by using network value/fundamentals calculation at the peaks, it seems that you assume that the market priced network value correctly back then. “What if at the peak of the mania (at that seems to have been mania phase) [network value] got ahead of fundamentals by, say, 300%? Wouldn't it mean market still searches for a fair price which may be lower? Even if NV/fundamentals equations does not show that?” asks user @Staska.  Burniske wrote about that in a comment on Medium, “We could solve [the overvalued market problem] by looking at the cycles over time, checking in at troughs and peaks, and looking at the relative change in fundamentals and prices between the two. A more time intensive analysis, but doable.” However, he did not add whether he intends to do such research in the future. On this potential overvaluation also hangs the question: is the current market drop a justifiable correction? However, with the lack of data, “it’s clear to me that Mr. (Crypto) Market has only a vague idea of what he’s doing right now,” Burniske adds."
0," This past week, we saw an extended decline in bitcoin price below the USD 3,500 and USD 3,400 support levels. BTC/USD tested the USD 3,200 - USD 3,220 support area and later recovered. The price traded above USD 3,400, but there are many resistances near USD 3,600 and USD 3,640. Ethereum price settled below the USD 100 support area. ETH/USD traded towards the USD 80 level and later started forming a support base near USD 85. Ripple price failed to surpass the USD 0.355 resistance and it recently tested the USD 0.300 support. The overall price structure is currently neutral above recent lows, with chances of a short term upside correction in bitcoin and altcoins. Total market capitalization  There was a decent upward move above the USD 3,400 resistance in bitcoin price . BTC/USD is currently up around 2% and it is trading near the USD 3,500 level. On the upside, an initial support is at USD 3,540, above which the price may test the USD 3,600 level. The main weekly resistance is near USD 3,640, above which there are chances of a decent rebound toward USD 4,000 and USD 4,200.
On the flip side, the USD 3,450 is a short term support. If buyers fail to surpass the USD 3,540 resistance, there could be a fresh drop below the USD 3,450 and USD 3,400 supports. The key weekly support is at USD 3,200, below which the price may even decline below USD 3,000 or USD 2,800. Ethereum price  declined heavily this past week and settled below the USD 100 level. ETH/USD traded close to the USD 80 level and later it corrected higher.
On the upside, the price is facing a couple of important hurdles near USD 95 and USD 100. A daily close above the USD 100 level could really boost the market sentiment in favor of buyers. If there is no break and close above USD 100, the price may decline towards USD 80 or USD 75. Bitcoin cash  is back above the USD 100 support. BCH/USD must break the USD 110 and USD 120 resistance levels to start a decent rebound in the near term. On the other hand, BCHSV declined below USD 100 and it is currently trading above the USD 98 support below which the price may slide towards USD 92.
Ripple price  climbed back above USD 0.300 and it is currently consolidating losses. XRP/USD is facing resistance near the USD 0.310 and USD 0.315 levels, and supports on the downside are USD 0.300 and USD 0.292. A few small cap altcoins gained bullish momentum recently and jumped more than 8%, including DEX, CENNZ, ELF, XIN, MAID, ETP and EOS. Out of these, DEX rallied more than 50% and CENNZ is up close to 20%. Overall, bitcoin price is currently consolidating above USD 3,400. To start a substantial recovery, BTC/USD must break the USD 3,640 resistance. If not, there is a risk of a fresh bearish wave in bitcoin and altcoins like ethereum, ripple, litecoin, eos, neo and tron in the near term.

0," Bitcoin (BTC) still has the potential to drop towards $3,000, despite a minor bounce from 15-month lows seen on Friday. The leading cryptocurrency by market value picked up a bid at $3,210 three days ago –  a level last seen in September 2017. The ensuing corrective bounce, however, seems to have run out of steam, as bitcoin is currently trading at $3,470 on Bitstamp – down 4 percent from yesterday’s high of $3,633. It’s worth noting that prices are currently down more than 80 percent from the record high of $20,000 reached last December. Further, BTC has depreciated close to 47 percent in the last month, forming record oversold conditions. Even so, BTC  is struggling to post a notable price bounce, which indicates bearish sentiment is still strong. As a result, the cryptocurrency is likely to remain on the defensive in the short-term, at least. Notably, the 3-day chart, which can offer a better picture of the broader market trend than the daily and intra-day charts, is indicating room for a drop below the psychological support of $3,000.  As seen above, the previous three-day candle closed below support at $3,463 (low of multiple three-day candles in September 2017), validating both the recent high-volume sell-off from $6,200 and the bearish lower-high pattern carved out along the downward sloping 5-candle moving average (MA) over the last few days. Further, both the recent “death cross” crossover between the 50- and 200-candle MAs and the steeply descending 10-candle MA are indicating a bearish setup. As a result, BTC has potential to test $2,972 (September 2017 low) in the near-term.  Over on the 4-hour chart, BTC is struggling to cut through the descending trendline hurdle (marked in yellow), currently at $3,540. A break above that level could yield a stronger corrective rally to $3,800 (falling trendline hurdle). The RSI, however, has already dived out of the ascending trendline, signaling bearish conditions. BTC, therefore, may have a tough time clearing the immediate resistance at $3,540.

0," The entire crypto market sold off heavily between Thursday night and Friday morning, sending Bitcoin down more than 10% over the past 24 hours to go below the USD 3,300 mark before recovering slightly. However, it seems that the general sentiment has not changed yet - despite the the market crash could get worse, cryptocurrencies  have great potential, still.   Now, even the two “stars” of this week - Waves (-20%) and Factom (-31%) - fell sharply, trimming their weekly gains to 25% and 12% respectively (UTC 06:15 AM).  The sharp losses came after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said they would further postpone a decision on whether to approve the much-anticipated bitcoin-backed exchange traded fund (ETF) by financial firm VanEck. The new deadline now is set to February 27, 2019. Top 10 coins  (UTC 06:35 AM) ____ Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, doesn't rule out that bitcoin could be headed straight for USD 1,500, as some analysts predict. ""Anything is possible but I would say that we have a lot of key levels before that will more than likely support the price. As you can see, we're currently testing the light support level at USD 3,500 (blue). If it breaks through to the downside we will likely encounter heavy support at USD 3,000 yellow. The red line is set at USD 1,800. All of these levels have played a significant role during the rise of 2017,"" the analyst wrote in a daily commentary on Thursday. According to him, for institutional investors looking to invest in the assets rather than the infrastructure, there really isn't much reason to go in strong at the moment. ""There simply isn't FOMO [fear of missing out],"" Greenspan stressed. ""However thinking long term, if we do think that bitcoin will pass through the all-time highs anytime within the next decade, it won't make much sense to wait until it USD 1,500 to start placing orders. Rather, large traders tend to set small orders in order to average out their entries,"" he added. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Tone Vays says that at least for now “it’s getting worse”: Taking a short break from #LABITCONF2018 to bring you guys a #Bitcoin price update. $BTCUSD charts looked very Bearish at this time yesterday & unfortunately it's getting worse.https://t.co/8jdBqlcV0a ___ Ethereum, which for a long-time held the position as the second-most valuable cryptocurrency, traded down by over 16% Friday morning, reaching price levels not seen since May 2017. Together with Stellar and EOS, ETH was one of the biggest losers among the top 10 coins over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency also experienced an extremely unusual event overnight when it saw a flash-crash on the Coinbase Pro platform, briefly sending it down to USD 13 before recovering, in what can only be described as a spectacular flash-crash. Coinbase Pro responded to the incident, simply saying they are “aware of price movement,” without admitting any kind of fault: So market selling through 88% of the orderbook on eth/usdc is working as normal ? It is still unclear exactly what caused the sudden drop in the ETH price, but the extremely quick sell-off and subsequent recovery is likely a sign of trading algorithms creating a snowball effect, for example triggered by a large order or a “fat finger” entering a wrong order. The second major happening overnight was Bitcoin SV, the Bitcoin Cash fork that came into existence on November 15, overtaking the more mainstream Bitcoin ABC (usually referred to simply as Bitcoin Cash) in terms of market capitalization.

Coin birthed by a total fraud takes the lead. pic.twitter.com/G1hhcA5FsX ___ At the time of writing, the two are still swapping places among the most valuable cryptocurrencies, however, there is no clear winner at the moment.  In the community, many speculate if this is just a short-lived attempt from the Bitcoin SV camp and its main backer Craigh “faketoshi” Wright at pumping up the price of their coin. If that’s the case, the pumpers are likely to run out of new capital soon and the rally may be short-lived. Bitcoin Cash has seen a particularly sharp decline over recent weeks, as the internal divide in the BCH community has hurt both sides badly. As reported, Stellar overtook BCH as the 4th most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap.

0," Yesterday, we saw bearish moves in bitcoin price below the USD 3,900 level. BTC/USD followed a negative trajectory and declined below the USD 3,800 and USD 3,750 supports. A new yearly low was formed below USD 3,700 before the price bounced back. Ethereum also declined heavily and broke the USD 105 and USD 100 support levels. Buyers appeared near USD 95 and later ETH/USD moved back above USD 100. On the other hand, declines in ripple were limited, but the price remained below the USD 0.355 and USD 0.350 support levels. Total market capitalization  There was a downside extension in bitcoin price  below the USD 3,850 support level. BTC/USD declined below the USD 3,800 and USD 3,750 levels and spiked below the USD 3,700 level. A new yearly low was formed near USD 3,670 and later the price bounced back above USD 3,800.
The price is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) flat around USD 3,860, with an immediate resistance near the USD 3,900 level. Above USD 3,900, the price could trade towards the key USD 4,000 resistance, which is likely to act as a strong resistance. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,800 followed by the USD 3,750 pivot zone. Ethereum price  struggled to break the USD 110 resistance, resulting in declines below USD 105. ETH/USD even broke the USD 100 support and traded to a new yearly low around USD 95.
Later, the price bounced back and traded above the USD 100 level. It is currently down 3% to USD 102, with an initial resistance at USD 105, above which the next key resistance is near the USD 110 level. Bitcoin cash  is under a lot of pressure and it is again down around 10% to USD 125. BCH declined below the USD 140 support recently and if sellers remain in action, the price could trade towards the USD 110 level. On the other hand, BCHSV traded higher by more than 5% and it is currently trading near the USD 90 level.
Ripple price  declined towards the USD 0.325 support area where buyers emerged. XRP/USD recovered and it is currently trading near USD 0.342, above which the price may test the USD 0.350 resistance. Many few small cap altcoins declined recently by more than 8% and moved further into a bearish zone, including DEX, XTZ, WAVES, MKR, AE, BTM, MITH, AION and BTS. Out of these, DEX is down around 16% and XTZ fell close to 15%. The current price action is still bearish below USD 4,000 for bitcoin. Should buyers push BTC/USD above the USD 4,000 resistance, there could be a decent recovery. If not, the price is likely to slide again below USD 3,800 and USD 3,700. Likewise, ethereum price must settle above USD 100 and move above USD 110, USD 115 and USD 120. If buyers continue to struggle, ETH/USD may extend declines below USD 95 and USD 90.

0," The pessimistic sentiment around bitcoin prices saw the number of shorts hit a six-week high on Thursday. At press time, BTC/USD short positions on the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex jumped to 37,891 – the highest level since Oct. 15 – and were last seen at 36,996. Notably, shorts have risen by 95 percent in the last three weeks, accompanying BTC’s recent drop to 14-month lows near $3,500. More importantly, the short positions remained elevated above 35,000 during BTC’s oversold bounce from $3,500 to $4,400 and climbed to fresh multi-week highs on Thursday. Further, the long-short ratio of 0.73 is biased toward the bears.  The data indicates that, despite being so deep into the bear market, sellers appear to be showing no signs of exhaustion. As a result, the cryptocurrency may revisit the recent low of $3,474 as hinted in the technical charts. The bearish sentiment, however, could soon reach extremes as the short positions are down just 7 percent from the record high of 40,289 that was reached on on Sept. 19. Moreover, the extreme bearish positioning is widely considered a sign that the sell-off is overdone and often presages a trend reversal. Therefore, the prospects of sudden bullish reversal, similar to the one seen on April 12, would improve substantially once the short positions reach record highs.

0," Bitcoin (BTC) remains on the defensive despite a 4-percent recovery from nine-day lows today, but bearish pressure may weaken if prices rise above key resistance near $3,900. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell to $3,629 at 05:00 UTC on Bitstamp – its lowest level since Nov. 27. At press time, the price stood at $3,770, representing a 1.5 percent drop on a 24-hour basis. Despite the quick recovery, the odds appear to be stacked in favor of a drop to recent lows below $3,500. To start with, BTC closed below $3,711 yesterday, invalidating the short-term bullish reversal signaled by last Wednesday’s 11 percent gains. The daily close also added credence to the bearish lower high carved out near $4,400 in the last few days. Added to that, the bearish setup on the long duration charts suggests strong potential for a deeper sell-off. That said, a minor recovery rally could be seen if prices cross resistance at $3,882 – upper edge of the falling wedge pattern – seen in the chart below.  As seen above, BTC suffered a symmetrical triangle breakdown yesterday, signaling an end of the corrective bounce and a resumption of the sell-off. So, the immediate outlook remains bearish as long as prices are holding below the lower edge of the symmetrical triangle pattern (former support), currently at $3,850. BTC, however, has also established a falling wedge –  a bullish reversal pattern. Therefore, the outlook as per the hourly chart would turn bullish if prices cross $3,882 (upper edge of the wedge). The breakout, if confirmed, would open up upside toward $4,265 (Dec. 2 high) and possibly to $4,410 (Nov. 29 high). Securing that bullish breakout, however, could prove a tough task, as the major moving averages (50-, 100- and 200-hour) are trending south in favor of the bears. Securing that bullish breakout, however, could prove a tough task, as the major moving averages (50-, 100-, and 200-hour) are trending south in favor of the bears.  Over on the daily chart, the lower high pattern, yesterday’s bearish close below $3,771 and the downward sloping 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (MAs) continue to favor a re-test of $3,474 (Nov. 25 low). Notably, BTC struggled to close above the 10-day EMA during the recent corrective bounce. So, a daily close above that EMA, if and when it occurs, could be considered an advance signal of an impending bullish move. That said, a more credible evidence of a trend reversal would be a convincing break above $4,400. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

0," Yesterday, we discussed that a decent recovery in bitcoin price won’t be easy. BTC/USD corrected above the USD 3,950 and USD 4,000 resistance levels, but sellers protected further gains above the USD 4,050 level. There was a fresh drop and the price moved below the USD 3,900 level. Similarly, ethereum price failed to settle above the USD 110 - USD 112 resistance and declined again. Ripple price is down more than 3% after it failed to break the USD 0.360 resistance level. The current (UTC 08:20 AM) market sentiment is bearish, suggesting more losses in bitcoin and altcoins in the short term. Total market capitalization  There was a slow and steady decline in bitcoin price  after buyers failed to clear the USD 4,050 level. BTC/USD moved down and traded below the USD 4,000 and USD 3,930 supports. An immediate support is near USD 3,800, below which there is a risk of a sharp decline towards the USD 3,600 level.
On the other hand, the price is facing many resistances near the USD 3,900 and USD 4,000 levels. A successful close above USD 4,000 may lift the market sentiment. Still, the price must break the USD 4,050 swing high for a decent rebound in the near term. Ethereum price  failed to gain pace above the USD 113 level, resulting in a fresh decline. ETH/USD is down more than 3% and it is currently trading well below the USD 110 level.
An initial support is at USD 105, below which the price may revisit the USD 100 support zone. To recover, buyers need to surpass the USD 112 and USD 115 resistance levels. Bitcoin cash  is down more than 10% and it traded below the USD 150 and USD 145 support levels. BCH is under a lot of pressure and it seems like it could even break the USD 130 level. BCHSV is also declined more than 7% and traded below the USD 90 support. The next support is at USD 82, below which the price may test USD 75.
Ripple price  faced a lot of selling interest near the USD 0.360 and USD 0.362 levels. XRP/USD declined and moved below the USD 0.355 support level. It seems like sellers are aiming for a test of the USD 0.332 support. Many few small cap altcoins faced an increased selling pressure and declined more than 8%, including NEXO, NPXS, MITH, EOS, ETP, AE, ETC, GXS, MANA, THETA and BAT. Out of these, NEXO is down around 20% and NPXS fell nearly 12%. However, Waves jumped by more than 33% in the past 24 hours due to positive news. Overall, bitcoin is back in a negative zone below USD 4,000. As long as BTC/USD is trading below the USD 4,100 and USD 4,200 pivot levels, there is a risk of more downsides in the near future. Ethereum also faces a major risk of heavy declines below USD 100 if buyers fail to push ETH/USD back above the USD 115 and USD 120 resistance levels.

0," Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent drop to 14-month lows has left the cryptocurrency on track for its biggest ever yearly loss. Just three weeks ago, the cryptocurrency was changing hands at $6,300 – already a 54 percent year-to-date drop, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The dominant market narrative back then was that BTC would trim losses in the last few weeks of 2018, having bottomed out around $6,000 in five months to October. However, on Nov. 14, BTC nosedived below the crucial 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) support, signaling a resumption of the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached last December. As a result, prices ultimately dropped to 14-month lows below $3,500 on Nov. 25 before regaining some poise. With the bears still keeping the upper hand, a significant recovery from current levels appears unlikely before year’s end, and BTC looks set to snap its three-year winning streak with a 73 percent annual price drop – its biggest on record. if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""]={},window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].embedDeltas={""100"":655.0208339999999,""200"":548.0208339999999,""300"":522.0208339999999,""400"":495.020834,""500"":495.020834,""700"":469.020834,""800"":469.020834,""900"":469.020834,""1000"":469.020834},window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-SXOv6""),window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""SXOv6""==b)window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""}); As seen in the table above, BTC’s only previous annual loss was a 57 percent drop in 2014. This year’s loss would be the biggest on record as long as prices hold below $5,959. Meanwhile, the technical charts indicate that the cryptocurrency may extend the loss further before the year’s end.  As seen above (price data via Bitstamp), BTC has found acceptance below the crucial support of the 200-week EMA, bolstering the already bearish technical set-up represented by the descending triangle breakdown, confirmed two weeks ago. BTC has suffered a symmetrical triangle breakdown on the 4-hour chart, indicating that the recent corrective bounce ended at the Nov. 29 high of $4,400 and the bears have likely regained control. The stacking order of the 50-candle EMA, below the 100-candle EMA, below the 200-candle EMA is also a classic bear indicator. BTC, therefore, risks re-testing the recent low of $3.474 in the next few days. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

1," The world’s second-largest stock exchange in the world, the Nasdaq exchange, has officially confirmed its plans to launch Bitcoin futures in 2019. Late last week, unofficial reports surfaced of the exchange launching these plans, first reported by Bloomberg. Joseph Christinat, VP of Nasdaq’s media team, spoke to the UK’s daily tabloid The Express yesterday and confirmed the plans. The VP states that these futures will be listed and launched in the first half of 2019—no official date has been given at this time. The launch still remains subject to approval from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Christinat told The Express: “We’ve put a hell of a lot of money and energy into delivering the ability to do this and we’ve been all over it for a long time—way before the market went into turmoil, and that will not affect the timing of this in any way. No. Period. We’re doing this no matter what.” This is a positive announcement for crypto enthusiasts. Most crypto-related projects that sprouted up in 2017 were knee-jerk reactions to what was hot in the market. This, however, seems like a thoroughly thought out plan that has been brewing for a while. Joseph Christinat’s interview did not confirm whether Nasdaq’s Bitcoin futures will be cash-backed or physically settled. Bakkt will be launching the first physically delivered Bitcoin futures in this coming January. Cash-settled Bitcoin futures came into the market in December of 2017 by the CBOE and CME Group. >> CVS Health, Aetna, UnitedHealth Group, and Humana Trial Blockchain Technology for Healthcare Back in November 2017, Nasdaq announced the target launch of their Bitcoin futures to be by mid-2018. Their plans hit a snag when Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies began tumbling in the first half of 2018. These plans were pushed back to create a “unique enough” offering to the market. According to CoinMarketCap, BTC is currently trading at $4,029.40 a coin, up 1.34%, in 24 hours. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© koydesign"
1," As many Bitcoin miners have turned off their machines, mining difficulty saw its second largest drop in history at -15% on December 3rd. It has helped to increase profitability for those who still run their mining rigs, but strengthened fears of centralization.  The mining difficulty of Bitcoin is adjusted every two weeks (every 2016 blocks, to be precise) to maintain the normal 10-minute block time. This means that if there are many miners competing amongst themselves and propagating blocks in less than ten minutes, the difficulty of the next puzzle will be increased; if there are few miners and it takes them much longer to find a solution, the difficulty is decreased - both times just enough to keep block times at around 10 minutes.  Now, the difficulty might drop another 16% after two weeks, according to estimations by major mining pool BTC.com. In that case, it would almost reach the difficulty levels seen in May/June.  According to previous reports, between 600,000 and 800,000 Bitcoin miners have pulled the plug on their operations in the second half of November. Market analysis firm Autonomous Research estimates that at least 100,000 individual miners have shut down, and advisory firm Fundstrat Global Advisors adds that since early September, about 1.4 million servers have been unplugged, Bloomberg reported on Monday. This flush out took the Bitcoin’s hash rate (or computing power) with it, as it is down 36% from its all-time high this September. As reported, miners are under growing pressure as the bitcoin price dropped by 80% since its all-time high in December of 2017. In November bitcoin lost 37% of its value, dropping below USD 4,000.  The CEO of China-based crypto mining pool F2Pool Shixing Mao said back in September that the break-even point for Bitcoin mining was between USD 3,891 and USD 11,581, depending on the equipment being used. At that time, BTC traded for around USD 6,400.  However, popular economist and Bitcoin investor Tuur Demeester stressed:  ""Bitcoin Mining breakeven cost"" is confusing as a general concept, because it implies a static BTC revenue per hash. However hashrate rewards adjust dynamically, via biweekly difficulty adjustment and the fee market. With the mining difficulty down as well, the remaining miners should have an easier job. However, Malachi Salcido, head of Wenatchee, one of the largest North American miners, told Bloomberg that only a select few can afford to stay in the game: miners with scale, very specific business models and extremely low electricity costs, which is the case in Douglas County where his own miners are based. Margins before costs like depreciation and taxes dropped from about 40% to 20% during the slide, but they jumped back up at the company to around 40% as smaller rivals shuttered operations, Salcido said. However, some fear a 51% attack in case some of the remaining mining companies decide to band together. The community is much more optimistic, though: they remind that the biggest ever drop of -18% back in 2011 brought to a price increase of 150% - from USD 2 to USD 5 in around 60 days.  Although many say that previous patterns are no guarantee for the future - “Just because it happened before, it does not mean it will happen again,” writes Reddit user u/Red5point1 - not all agree with that sentiment. As u/Mowglio points out, “Sure, historical data does not guarantee future results, but it is literally what all scientific analysis is based on. Throwing it to the wind as if it doesn't matter is one of the dumbest things you can do.”

Watch Andreas M. Antonopoulos, a technologist and serial entrepreneur, discussing whether sudden changes in mining hash power would kill Bitcoin:"
0," Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, remains as unknown as ever, but perhaps not so elusive after all. New posts, like one on his/hers social network P2PFoundation profile, seem to indicate that he/she has not left the world for good. But is it him/her, an impostor, or a practical joke? The first seemingly significant thing that happened in November was the appearance of a Twitter account under the handle @satoshi (now closed by Twitter), which tweeted, “I do not want to be public, but, there is an issue with SegWit. If it is not fixed, there will be nothing and I would have failed. There is only one way that Bitcoin survives and it is important to me that it works. Important enough, that I may be known openly.” The tweet appeared on November 16th - incidentally, one day after the already infamousBitcoin Cash hard fork. There had been previous tweets as well, mostly copy-pasted sentences from the Bitcoin whitepaper, as well as some numbers that are actually just plugged into formulae to calculate the probability of a successful attack on the network. The above mentioned tweet is the first one not to quote the whitepaper directly. However, the account was later suspended. Then, on November 29th, Satoshi’s P2PFoundation profile showed some activity for the first time since early 2011. First, it added a guy named Wagner Tamanaha to its friends list, and then posed a single word, “nour,” which many from the community point out means “light” in Arabic.  However, there are claims that the email used by the account is [email protected], which was allegedly hacked back in 2014. The hacking incident was first brought to light on the Bitcointalk forum, where a user claimed to have received a message from that address writing, “Michael, send me some coins before I hitman you,” and pointing out that this is not really Satoshi’s usual style. Now, this could well mean that the P2PFoundation profile was compromised as well. And that’s what most of the community seems to agree on: all of this is probably fake. Reddit user u/mr_li_jr writes, “If anyone wants to claim to be Satoshi, they can move his coins. Anything else can be faked or hacked,” and this sentiment is echoed by most of the community throughout several social networks.  It would seem that the big question behind it was never the validity of the posts, but who’s behind them and why? Most of the community readily points at Craig Wright, often dubbed Faketoshi due to his claim that he is Satoshi Nakamoto and general lack of any sort of proof. The timing of the tweet claiming that Satoshi might reveal himself is suspicious enough, as it is a day after the BCH hard fork, when it seemed that Bitcoin SV, backed by Wright, would lose the battle.  Wright’s Twitter account is a cesspool of cryptic tweets. On the same day when the @satoshi account wrote its last tweet, Wright wrote, “I have done all I can for now to warn people. I will work to make the system right, it is not you, it is not your profit, it is sound money for the world. If you cannot understand that, I cannot make you. I hope that your children will,” later adding, “About a year from now, I have something to release, but, right now, I cannot. So, the place is marked and saved, and in the time it takes, you will find what that is... when it is fixed.” Wright also wrote two tweets in Arabic around 7 hours after Satoshi’s “nour” post, both of which contain the word “light” in it. One translates to, “The light haunts the darkness,” while the other means, “The light of the world in trade.” Neither of those were subsequently explained, however.  Now the community is debating on whether the “Satoshi” accounts are controlled by Wright, or if he’s as clueless as the rest of the community but just trying to connect himself to those posts. Most believe that the latter is the case: Redditor u/HiTierChris writes, “There is a huge time difference between when Craig posted that and when that was posted from Satoshi's profile. Is there a possibility that Satoshi actually posted that and Craig saw that and now is pretending that it's him?” and u/JasonLeeH replies, “Yes, that's exactly what is happening.” However, this option also implies that if the accounts are neither owned by Satoshi or Wright, there is yet another Faketoshi in the game - Faketoshi v2.0, if you will. Maybe they’re trolling, maybe they want to spread FUD in the community, or maybe they’re just kids who are having a few laughs. Still, another unknown element in the game seriously hinders the possibility of ever discovering who Satoshi really is.  But should we discover it in the first place? Many in the community are content with letting sleeping dogs lie, while some are actively warning against demystifying the creator of the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Some even warn that it could put Satoshi in danger. Whether or not Satoshi is still alive, following the crypto market or not, or maybe even debating coming back into the spotlight, one fact remains: nobody will believe him/her until he proves he/she has access to the original Satoshi’s private key, as well as funds. Until then, listening to the FUD can only be harmful in the long run. The question remains: does it matter who Satoshi is, and would his/her reappearance really change anything?"
0," Do you want to leave an immutable message for future generations? Then check out the Blockchainsareforever.com project. It’s not the best service for private messaging as every single message is recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, which means that they are public and can never be modified or deleted. This fun service isn’t that revolutionary, as it has been possible to add messages on the Bitcoin blockchain since its inception. For example, Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, included this message in the Genesis Block, or the first-ever block of Bitcoin: ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."" Meanwhile, this year, TD Ameritrade, an online broker, planted their literal flag on the Bitcoin’s blockchain, effectively making an advertisement for themselves. However, “Blockchains are forever” makes this much easier. Just type in your message, choose whether you want your message to show on the Bitcoin blockchain or testnet, choose your payment method (via the Lightning Network or the regular Bitcoin payment), pay, and voilá! Your message is “immortalized.” This is what people are sending into eternity: It won’t cost you a lot to try “Blockchains are forever” as sending one message is less than 5 US dollar cents. However, you are only allowed to send 80 characters in a single message. So, if you are planning to add a wall of text to the Bitcoin blockchain, be sure to stock up with BTC first. Cryptonews.com covered two similarly creative crypto projects previously. The first one is Steem Whale, which allows you to make an artificial whale fountain squirt by sending the Steem cryptocurrency.  Another fun project is Satoshi’s Place, a graffiti board to show the power and capabilities of the Lightning Network. There’re one million pixels on the canvas with each costing 1 satoshi to paint. Even if you draw something large, it won’t cost you a lot. But be aware: others can respray your art! Hower, immutability of public blockchains is being used to send serious messages, also. As reported in April, activists have posted a student of Peking University's #MeToo movement letter on the Ethereum blockchain in an attempt to avoid government censorship."
0," A crypto-backed exchange traded product (ETP) traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange is seeing interest from buyers, despite the year-long bear market in cryptocurrencies. On the Monday morning, it's among top 3 ETPs by performance and turnover. In comparison, on November 26, or six days after its launch, the ETP managed to reach the CHF 425,712 (USD 426,601) turnover, topping the list of ETPs. Similar to the better-known exchange traded funds (ETFs), exchange traded product (ETP) is the name given to the broader category of financial derivatives instruments that are traded on public stock exchanges. ETPs encompasses ETFs, exchange traded notes (ETNs), and various tradable certificates. The fund, named Amun Crypto ETP – with the fitting ticker code “HODL” – is designed as a weighted basket of 5 popular cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple XRP, Ether, and Litecoin, and is available for both retail investors and financial institutions. Bitcoin makes up nearly half of the fund, Ripple has around 30%, Ethereum almost 16%, and Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin each around 3%. Since going live on November 21, the ETP has seen mixed performance, in-line with the performance of the overall crypto market, which has also had a rough November. So far, the fund is down about 16% since its launch, but just like the major cryptocurrencies, it has also bounced up by more than 7% from a bottom that was reached on November 27. According to Richard Johnson, market structure expert at Greenwich Associates, a market intelligence and advisory firm, some of the interest in the HODL ETP may be due to large institutions seeking opportunities to profit from arbitrage trading between the ETP and the physical market for the underlying cryptocurrencies, The Block reported last week. How successful this arbitrage trading has been is unclear, but the persistent interest from large trading firms suggests that there is money to be made this way.  According to a Bloomberg report, trading firms Jane Street and Flow Traders provided liquidity to the ETP during its launch, and continues to actively trade it. However, both firms reportedly decline to comment on the extent of their current trading activities in the new ETP."
0," This past week, there was a decent rebound in bitcoin price above the USD 4,300 resistance level. However, BTC/USD failed to gain pace above USD 4,400 and declined later. The price is now back in a bearish zone and it is trading (UTC 08:30 AM) near key supports at USD 4,000 and USD 3,700. Similarly, ethereum price failed to break the major resistance at USD 125 - USD 126 and later declined. Ripple price too struggled to surpass the USD 0.400 barrier, which later resulted in a fresh decline in XRP/USD. The current market sentiment is bearish and if bitcoin price dives below USD 4,000, there could be an increase in selling pressure. Total market capitalization  After failing to trade past USD 4,400, bitcoin price  declined below the USD 4,350 and USD 4,300 support levels. BTC/USD sellers gained traction below USD 4,200 and pushed the price towards the USD 4,000 support.
The price is currently down around 4% and it is consolidating near the USD 4,000 support. If there is a downside break, the price could test the USD 3,920 support. However, the main weekly support is at USD 3,700, below which the price could trade to new yearly lows. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 4,100 followed by the weekly swing zone near USD 4,220. Ethereum price  was rejected near the USD 125 - USD 126 resistance area. Later, there was a downside correction and ETH/USD declined below the USD 115 and USD 112 support levels.
The price is currently trading above the USD 110 support, below which the price could trade towards the crucial weekly support at USD 102. On the upside, the USD 116 level is an initial resistance. However, a successful close above the USD 125 level is needed for bullish acceleration in the near term. Bitcoin cash  extended declines below the USD 200 and USD 180 support levels. BCH is currently down around 6% and it is approaching the USD 160 support. The next key support is at USD 150 followed by USD 145. BCHSV is also down around 5% and it is trading below the USD 100 support. The next major support is at USD 90, followed by USD 82.
Ripple price  failed to break the USD 0.400 resistance and declined. XRP/USD traded below the USD 0.482 and USD 0.475 supports and it is currently trading just above the USD 0.360 support level. A few small cap altcoins declined recently between 8% - 15%, including BTCP, THETA, STEEM, FCT, RVN, PPT and ICX. Out of these, BTCP is down around 13% and THETA declined close to 12%. To sum up, bitcoin price is clearly struggling to rebound with strength above USD 4,200 and USD 4,400. As long as there is no weekly close above USD 4,500, BTC/USD remains at a risk of more losses. On the downside, the main supports are USD 3,920 and USD 3,700, below which sellers may perhaps aim USD 3,400, which could increase selling pressure on altcoins like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin, eos and tron.

0," Bitcoin (BTC) may break its three-year December winning streak unless prices convincingly cross key resistance at $4,410 in the next few days. The leading cryptocurrency by market value gained 14 percent, 30 percent and 40 percent in the last month of 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. (BPI). The odds, however, are stacked against BTC extending that winning streak this year. To start with, BTC’s convincing break below the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) last month signaled a resumption of the bear market from the record high of $20,000 reached 12 months ago. Essentially, the bears are in control while prices are trading below the key EMA, currently located at $5,747 Further, the corrective bounce from recent lows below $3,500 ran out of steam near $4,410 last Thursday, validating the strong bearish view put forward by the break below the 21-month EMA. Meanwhile, historical data shows BTC broke a similar three-year December winning streak in 2013. if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""]={},window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].embedDeltas={""100"":634.0208339999999,""200"":580.0208339999999,""300"":527.0208339999999,""400"":527.0208339999999,""500"":527.0208339999999,""700"":501.020834,""800"":501.020834,""900"":501.020834,""1000"":501.020834},window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-SXOv6""),window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""SXOv6""==b)window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""});  That said, the odds of BTC extending the December winning streak would rise if prices clear the newly established resistance of $4,410 (Nov. 29 high). As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,980 on Bitstamp, representing 1.1 percent drop from its monthly opening price of $4,024.  As seen above, the bullish divergence of the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) confirmed last Wednesday has failed to produce a notable rally, which indicates bearish sentiment is still quite strong. Moreover, BTC created a doji candle on Thursday, signaling indecision in the marketplace despite a bullish divergence, falling below $4,000 on Friday and confirming an end to the corrective bounce. Essentially, the cryptocurrency has carved out a lower high (bearish pattern) at $4,400. The 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) are also trending south, indicating a bearish setup. As a result, the cryptocurrency looks set to re-test the recent low of $3,474. However, a convincing break above $4,400 (Nov. 29 high) would revive the bullish view and allow a sustained rally to psychological resistance of $5,000.  The descending triangle breakdown (bearish continuation pattern) and the downward sloping 5- and 10-week EMAs indicate the path of least resistance is to the downside. The 14-week RSI is holding well above 30.00 (undersold territory), meaning there is scope for a drop toward $3,000. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

1," Bitcoin just ended its worst-performing month in seven years in terms of month-over-month price declines.  The world’s largest cryptocurrency began November at an average price across exchanges of $6,341, but as of 0:00 UTC on December 1 is trading at just $3,964, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.  As it stands, the near $2,400 drop in bitcoin’s price has created a -37.4 percent monthly performance, which is its worst on record since August 2011, when it fell from roughly $8 to $4.80 to print a -40 percent monthly loss, according to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""NG8Fd""]={},window.datawrapper[""NG8Fd""].embedDeltas={""100"":600,""200"":550,""300"":525,""400"":525,""500"":500,""700"":500,""800"":500,""900"":500,""1000"":500},window.datawrapper[""NG8Fd""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-NG8Fd""),window.datawrapper[""NG8Fd""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""NG8Fd""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""NG8Fd""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""NG8Fd""==b)window.datawrapper[""NG8Fd""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""});
Since bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization by a considerable margin, now comprising 53.5 percent of the total market, all other cryptocurrencies tend to follow its lead when it comes to price performance.  As a result, the broader market suffered substantial losses in November, with just one of the world’s largest 25 cryptocurrencies able to post a monthly gain.  The outlier was bitcoin SV, a fork off of the original bitcoin cash blockchain, yet it has only existed long enough to accrue 22 days of pricing data on CoinMarketCap. if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""]={},window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].embedDeltas={""100"":625,""200"":575,""300"":525,""400"":500,""500"":500,""700"":500,""800"":475,""900"":475,""1000"":475},window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-SXOv6""),window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""SXOv6""==b)window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""}); Double-digits losses were common among the world’s largest cryptocurrencies in November.

What’s more, the average performance of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization was -30 percent, while the average performance of all 25 was -37 percent. Since market capitalization is a function of the price of a cryptocurrency multiplied by its circulating supply, the capitalization of the total market takes a hit whenever prices experience a steep drop.  At the beginning of November, the total market capitalization recorded a value of $203 billion, yet today that figure records $130 billion, a 35 percent loss. The total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market has now lost over $690 billion and 83 percent of its value since reaching its all time high north of $820 billion this past January, according to CoinMarketCap.

0," There was a decent recovery in bitcoin price above the USD 4,000 resistance. Yesterday, BTC/USD even spiked above the USD 4,400 resistance level, but buyers failed to gain bullish momentum. As a result, there was a bearish reaction and the price declined below USD 4,400 and USD 4,300. Similarly, ethereum price struggled to break the USD 125 - USD 126 resistance zone and declined recently. Ripple and bitcoin cash also to clearly weekly resistances and corrected lower. It seems like bitcoin and altcoins buyers are exhausted, which may result in a few bearish moves in the near term. Total market capitalization  There was a fresh upside above the USD 4,350 resistance in bitcoin price . BTC/USD even broke the USD 4,400 resistance, but there was no proper close. As a result, the price started a downside correction and traded below the USD 4,400, USD 4,350 and USD 4,300 support levels.
The next support is at USD 4,200, below which there is a risk of an extended decline towards the USD 4,000 support. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 4,300, followed by the USD 4,400 level. A successful daily close above USD 4,400 could open the doors for more gains above USD 4,500. Ethereum price  failed to break the USD 125 - USD 126 resistance zone and started a downside move. ETH/USD declined below USD 122 and USD 120 and it is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) down more than 2%.
An initial support is at USD 115, below which the price could slide towards the USD 110 level. On the upside, buyers are likely to struggle near the USD 122, USD 125 and USD 126 resistance levels. Bitcoin cash  is down more than 4% and it broke the USD 180 support level. It seems like BCH may perhaps continue to move down and it could test the USD 170 or USD 165 support level. BCHSV moved back below the USD 100 support and it will most likely decline further towards the USD 92 or USD 90 support.
Ripple price  climbed higher towards the USD 0.400 weekly resistance where sellers emerged. XRP/USD declined and traded below the USD 0.390 and USD 0.380 support levels. The next support is at USD 0.370, below which buyers could defend USD 0.360. A few small cap altcoins gained traction and traded higher more than 8%, including CENNZ, THETA, LINK and FCT. Out of these, CENNZ is up around 14% and THETA gained nearly 13%. To sum up, bitcoin price is currently correcting lower after it failed to clear the USD 4,400 resistance level. BTC/USD may perhaps continue to correct lower, but the USD 4,000 support could stop declines. Likewise, ethereum and ripple are currently correcting lower and approaching key supports where buyers may reappear.

0," Bitcoin (BTC) tanked in November on the back of high volumes, raising the possibility that the market has, to some extent, capitulated. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $4,000 – down 36 percent from its monthly opening price of $6,318 – according to CoinMarketCap data. That drop marks the biggest monthly loss of the year so far. Amid the losses, trading volumes jumped by 33 percent month-on-month to $158.48 billion – the highest level since May. It is worth noting that, at the start of the month, BTC was already down close to 70 percent from the record high of almost $20,000 reached in December 2017. So, November’s losses essentially mark an extension of the bear market (which had supposedly bottomed out near $6,000) with a high-volume drop to 14-month lows below $3,500. But BTC’s failure to produce a meaningful bounce despite the repeated defense of the 21-month EMA in five months to October might have left investors disappointed, resulting in the increased sell-off as they left the market. Amid these signs of capitulation, it is still too early to call a long-term bottom. In the last few days, however, prices have recovered from lows below $3,500 – possibly just bargain hunting after the sell-off, but potentially the start of a corrective rally, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) was reporting record oversold conditions a few days ago.  On the monthly chart, BTC is set to close below the former support (now resistance) of the 21-month EMA for the first time since October 2015. A long-term bullish reversal would only be confirmed if and when prices clear the EMA, currently lined up at $5,977.  On the 4-hour chart, BTC has fallen back below the double top neckline support at $4,120, having faced rejection at the falling trendline. As a result, the immediate bullish outlook has been neutralized. The recent low of $3,474 could come into play if the immediate support at $3,771 (low of Wednesday’s bullish reversal candle) is breached. A break above the falling trendline, if confirmed, would bolster the already bullish technical setup and could yield a stronger rally toward $5,000.

1," Bitcoin (BTC) made a rather dramatic comeback just 48 hours ago. At press time, the world’s first digital currency is currently trading above $4,300. The entire crypto community is buzzing, as most altcoins have followed BTC’s upward movements. The cryptocurrency community took a huge hit in mid-November when Bitcoin Cash miners started a hash war. Investors lost confidence in the maturity of the community, as the war dragged out after Bitcoin Cash split in two. On one side was Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com, who led the Bitcoin ABC movement. On the other was Craig Wright, also known as ‘Faketoshi’ by the crypto community, who led Bitcoin SV. Very much like the split of the Ethereum blockchain with Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Cash was split into Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin ABC. During that mess, Bitcoin (BTC) and most altcoins began to plummet. While the Bitcoin Cash mess hasn’t fully cleared, it seems investors have gained their confidence back in crypto once more. There has been a lot of crypto-positive news that has debuted this morning—which should boost investor confidence even further. Ohio becomes the first state to allow businesses to pay taxes with Bitcoin https://t.co/iGo7RtHri2 pic.twitter.com/rhKBHzoqzO — CNN Business (@CNNBusiness) November 29, 2018  As for the news in the tweet above, it remains unclear how many businesses will actually use this means of paying taxes, but it is a positive movement for the crypto community. Perhaps the biggest Bitcoin news of the day came from the Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Yesterday, at the Consensus conference, Jeff Sprecher was asked, “Will digital assets survive?” “The unequivocal answer is yes,” Sprecher replied. “As an exchange operator it’s not our objective to opine on prices.” He went on to explain that there are thousands of digital tokens out there that can be argued are ‘better’ than Bitcoin, and yet it continues to survive and gain mainstream attention. Sprecher continued: “Often times in finance, it’s not about being the best—it turns out to be about being the broadest and the most commonly accepted and for whatever reason bitcoin has become that.” >> Will Bitcoin (BTC) Hit $15,000 Again? Tom Lee Thinks So According to CoinMarketCap, BTC is currently trading at $4,318.29 a coin, up 2.93% in 24 hours. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© mmaxer"
1," North Korea, the country with one of the most feared hacker army, is reportedly targeting individual crypto owners in order to steal their coins.  According to Simon Choi, a senior researcher at the South Korean antivirus company Hauri, North Korean hackers have previously targeted crypto exchanges, but now, as direct attacks against exchanges have become harder, they are after individual digital currency users, South China Morning Post reported.  Since April 2018, the South Korean cybersecurity firm Cuvepia detected over 30 cases where North Korean hackers allegedly targeted crypto users, the company’s CEO, Kwon Seok-chul stated, according to the report. Kwon added that some cases might have gone undetected, so he estimates that the possible number of the hacks could be as high as 100. According to the report, hackers send infected email attachments with malware, so they can take over control of a crypto user’s device when the attachment is opened. Most of the victims of the recent hacks were wealthy South Korean cryptocurrency users as hackers believe that they could steal “billions” from these targets, Choi said. As mentioned, in the past, hackers were targeting crypto related institutions. For example, earlier this year, North Korean hackers had reportedly attacked an unnamed South Korean cryptocurrency exchange. The attackers tried to breach the exchange four times, but every attempt was unsuccessful. North Korea was also reportedly responsible for compromising 36,000 user accounts on the South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb and Coinis’ USD 2 million raid in 2017.  Furthermore, according to the IT security firm McAfee, North Korean hackers were behind the attack on Turkey’s financial industry and government organizations where the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities of Adobe Flash to inject malware to the victims’ computers."
1," Two Iranians who reportedly helped exchange Bitcoin ransom payments into Iranian rial on behalf of Iranian malicious cyber actors were caught as their Bitcoin addresses were identified by the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). This serves as an important reminder that Bitcoin is not anonymous, but pseudonymous, and that this can be used to track transactions. The money comes from the SamSam ransomware scheme, which targeted over 200 known victims, including corporations, hospitals, universities, and government agencies, in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada since 2015. The malicious actors held their victims’ data hostage in order to collect ransom, paid in bitcoin. The two identified bitcoin addresses (149w62rY42aZBox8fGcmqNsXUzSStKeq8C and 1AjZPMsnmpdK2Rv9KQNfMurTXinscVro9V) connected to this scheme have reportedly seen over 7,000 bitcoin transactions through various cryptocurrency exchanges to exchange around 6,000 BTC into Iranian rial. The OFAC clarifies, however, that not all of those funds stem from the SamSam scheme.  Supposedly, the two addresses belong to Ali Khorashadizadeh and Mohammad Ghorbaniyan, who were “central to the SamSam ransomware scheme’s success,” according to OFAC. This is also the first time that the Office publicly attributed crypto addresses to individuals, and they warn, “Regardless of whether a transaction is denominated in a digital currency or traditional fiat currency, OFAC compliance obligations are the same.” The release also adds, “As a result of today’s action, persons that engage in transactions with Khorashadizadeh and Ghorbaniyan could be subject to secondary sanctions.” Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker said, “Treasury is targeting digital currency exchangers who have enabled Iranian cyber actors to profit from extorting digital ransom payments from their victims [...] We are publishing digital currency addresses to identify illicit actors operating in the digital currency space.” The term “pseudonymity,” often used to describe Bitcoin’s modus operandi, derives from pseudonym, meaning “false name.” This means that you are simply using a fake name that can be traced back to you, as you’re not completely anonymous (“nameless”). In the original Bitcoin whitepaper, it was recommended that Bitcoin users use a new address for each transaction to avoid the transactions being linked to a common owner. However, there are still ways to trace these transactions as well. Many cryptocurrencies (so-called privacy coins) exist for the sole reason of “correcting” pseudonymity, as it is often seen as a weakness of Bitcoin, with the most popular example being Monero.  This is also not the first time that the US has cracked down on crypto criminals: only recently, a crypto trader has received 15 months of prison time for misappropriating more than USD 1.1 million worth of Bitcoin and Litecoin."
1," Bitcoin (BTC) is teasing a short-term bullish reversal, having just recorded its biggest single-day gain in seven months. Prices closed yesterday (UTC) at $4,257, a 24-hour increase of 11.43 percent and the highest daily gain since April 12, according to CoinMarketCap. Back then, the cryptocurrency was trading above $6,900, 38 percent higher than the current price of $4,345. Interestingly, the 13 percent price gain witnessed that day had been preceded by a 45 percent drop and a minor bout of consolidation. More importantly, the big bullish move of April 12 marked the beginning of the rally, which saw prices rise to near $10,000 by early May. Similarly, yesterday’s 11 percent rise had been preceded by a 44 percent drop to 14-month lows below $3,400. Further, positive signs are building up on the short duration technical charts. As a result, bitcoin could be in for a short-term bullish reversal, similar to the one witnessed after April 12.  Yesterday, BTC created a big bullish candle, validating the bearish exhaustion signaled by the previous three long-tailed candles. With the strong move higher, the 14-day relative strength has moved back into undersold territory above 30.00, confirming a bullish divergence (higher low on RSI). So, it’s possible history is about to repeat itself with a bullish move toward $5,000. Notably, the bullish case looks stronger than it did seven months ago. The RSI hit record lows during the recent sell-off, signaling extreme oversold conditions, as opposed to readings above 30 registered before April 12.  Over on the 4-hour chart, the cryptocurrency is probing the falling channel resistance of $4,320 at press time, having confirmed a double bottom breakout with a move above $4,120 earlier today. Notably, the bull flag breakout seen in the 15-minute chart is signaling that the falling channel hurdle could be breached in the next few hours. The breakout, if confirmed, would only bolster the already bullish technical setup. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

1," Many in the financial world this week were claiming Bitcoin was “dead” after it hit its 2018 record lows this week. What they didn’t predict was a Bitcoin rally. On Sunday, the world’s first digital currency hit just above $3,600 a coin, which is the coin’s record-low this year. Bitcoin hadn’t seen below $3,700 since mid-September 2017, and this past week, the cryptocurrency was down almost -40% for the month. However, on Tuesday night that all began to shift. In around 60 minutes, Bitcoin jumped up in price over $200. While this isn’t the monumental rise it had on a daily basis in late-2017, the jump shows a positive trend. Major sells-offs began when the miners behind Bitcoin Cash started a civil war. The digital currency was set for its semi-annual upgrade and was split into two competing digital currencies after its hard fork. There were other contributing factors to the sell-offs, but the hash war exposed the immaturity of these projects and lost a lot of investor trust. What may have spiked the Bitcoin rally last night was the recently released news of Nasdaq still planning to launch its own Bitcoin futures in the first quarter of 2019. This step could bring more institutional investors into the playing field, without them needing to actually buy the digital currency. Many investors have been patiently waiting for Bitcoin ETFs to roll out, but Jay Clayton, the Executive Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has yet to confirm the decision. >> ADAM will Set a Code of Conduct for Crypto Participants “What investors expect is that the trading in that commodity that’s underlying the ETF is trading that makes sense, is free from the risk or significant risk of manipulation,” Clayton reportedly told the Consensus Invest Conference in Manhattan. “Those kinds of safeguards don’t exist in many of the markets where digital currencies trade.” The SEC is expected to announce its decision in late December. If approved, investors would be able to buy into Bitcoin without having to deal with cryptocurrency exchanges. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $4,202.51 a coin, up 12.71%, in 24 hours. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Syda_Productions"
1," Over the course of the past few weeks, the interest of the general population in Bitcoin has seen a significant rise. Well, the interest in the Bitcoin price and whether Bitcoin is dead, to be precise.  Also, it is not popular to look for information on Bitcoin adoption or where this cryptocurrency could be spent. However, possibly the good news is that people are still more interested in buying than selling bitcoin. (Of course, those who already own cryptocurrency most likely know how to sell it, as the market crash showed.) Now, let's take a closer look at graphs.    Looking at the data from Google trends for the past three months, it seems as the number of searches for the term 'bitcoin' has more than doubled. As expected in these volatile times, the term 'bitcoin price' has also seen an increase in interest. The majority of the interest falls to African countries, with Nigeria leading the charge, followed by Ghana and South Africa. Interestingly enough, the tiny island of Saint Helena has also made the list, with a significant percentage of queries coming from the speck of land in the South Atlantic Ocean. With the recent price crash that has seen bitcoin move down from USD 6,400 mere weeks ago, another interesting term is getting more attention – 'is bitcoin dead'. Canada, the US, as well as Australia and South Africa, are most interested in this term.  Reasons as to why the sudden increase in interest is nothing but pure speculation, although it is safe to assume that it is driven mostly by high volatility and price fluctuations we’ve seen in the past few weeks. Such events draw the attention of the media, and with them – the general public. It is unlikely that it was the other way around, with interest in cryptocurrencies running the prices into the ground. However, as mentioned above, interest in buying bitcoin is still much higher than in selling or spending it. In Google's charts at least."
1," Argentina, which is in the middle of an escalating financial crisis, will have to wait more to get at least 150 Bitcoin ATMs, which were promised to install by the end of this year. As reported in October, the US company Odyssey Group planned to install 150 Bitcoin ATMs in the Latin American country totaling 1,600 machines by the end of 2019. Moreover, another company, Athena Bitcoin that had set up the first crypto cash point in Argentina, has also stated that it expects to have a total of 30 machines in the country by the end of 2018. However, it seems that the country won’t see dozens of new Bitcoin ATMs anytime soon. Odyssey Group has postponed its plans and now estimates to enter the market during the next six months, the Next Web reported, citing CEO Sebastian Ponceliz. According to the report, he claims that the reason for postponing Argentina’s Bitcoin ATM upgrade is due to the central bank of the country and the organization’s local market partners that allegedly asked the company to adjust “all the legal and technical requirements” that were “demanded” by the aforementioned parties. However, the report stressed that the company has previously made multiple promises that have yet to come true. In September 2017, the subsidiary of the company, Octagon, planned to install 250 crypto ATMs in Buenos Aires by October. While in May 2018, Ponceliz announced that his company had reached an agreement with Argentina’s central bank to roll out 4,000 machines. Moreover, in the same interview, the CEO claimed that 200 ATMs had been set up in the Latin American country. But that did not happen, according to Coin ATM Radar that shows only four working crypto cash points in the country, all installed by Athena. At press time, Athena did not respond to a request for comment. Bitcoin ATMs in Buenos Aires: ____ Meanwhile, the Argentinian Peso has been in a great decline since the start of this year.  ARS / USD rate: However, the fact that fiat currencies tend to be more volatile in Latin America brings ""a tremendous opportunity for adoption across the region,"" according to some investors. For example, OKGroup, the owner of the major crypto-to-crypto exchange OKEx, has entered the region via its fiat-to-crypto exchange OKCoin, which offers its services in more than 110 countries. “As the value of Argentina’s fiat currency remains uncertain, our hope is that we can help bring some stability to the country’s economy by providing Argentines with an array of cryptocurrency options,"" OKCoin’s Latin American representative, Pablo Magro, told Cryptonews.com earlier in November.

1," After the past few days of heavy selling, crypto markets are again in the green across the board today. All top 20 coins are seeing gains on Wednesday. It seems that buyers once again has hit the markets, after selling has brought prices of most coins down to levels that some would consider “cheap” again. This comes at the same time as a range of positive news developments have been revealed regarding the much-anticipated institutional entry into crypto.  Let’s go through them one by one: Nasdaq, the second-largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization, aims to allow Bitcoin futures trading in the first quarter of 2019, despite the market crash this year, Bloomberg reported, citing “two people familiar with the matter.”  The Nasdaq futures will be based off the Bitcoin’s price on numerous spot exchanges, as compiled by VanEck Associates Corp., according to the report. This comment was uttered by Jeffrey Sprecher, the founder and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) when asked about the recent decline in bitcoin prices during the CoinDesk’s Consensus conference in New York on Tuesday. ICE is the parent company and an important backer of the new Bakkt platform, which is widely expected to bring more institutional liquidity into the bitcoin market.  Sprecher was joined on stage by Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler, who echoed the same sentiment by saying “the price is being expressed but there’s a lot of missing infrastructure and use cases,” thus suggesting that prices may recover once the “missing infrastructure” is put in place, according to Coindesk. However, as reported, the launch date of the Bakkt platform will be pushed back to January 24, 2019, from an originally scheduled release in December of this year.  The retail investors in crypto are becoming more reasonable, while institutions are starting to establish a foothold for the long-term, Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at insurance and investment giant Allianz said during the same conference on Tuesday. The highly regarded economist further said that he believes cryptocurrencies “will exist,” and that they will become “more and more widespread,” Reuters reported. However, he also added a word of caution to some of the most outspoken crypto enthusiasts, saying “[cryptocurrencies] will not be [as] dominant as some of the early adopters believed them to be.” Meanwhile, at the same conference, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton reiterated the SEC’s stance that bitcoin is not a security. “An asset like bitcoin, where it’s designed to be a replacement for sovereign currencies, we’ve determined that doesn’t have the attributes of a security,” Clayton said, according to Yahoo Finance. However, when it came to the much-anticipated bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF), Clayton’s comments were not so positive. On the issue of a potential ETF approval, Clayton explained that whatever asset an ETF is based on must be “free from the risk of manipulation.” He added that this is “an issue that needs to be addressed before I would be comfortable [with approving a bitcoin ETF].” And it looks like the crypto industry is trying to address these issues. In the US, a new crypto association has emerged that aims to establish a Code of Conduct for emerging digital asset markets.  Ten financial services and technology firms, including Galaxy Digital, Paxos, Genesis Global Trading among others, launched the Association for Digital Asset Markets (ADAM.) It will will work with current and former regulators to provide rules for the efficient trading, custody, clearing and settlement of digital assets, according to the announcement. ADAM’s Code of Conduct will include guidelines for market integrity, risk management, KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti-money laundering), custody, record keeping, clearing and settlement, market manipulation, data protection, and research, among other topics."
1," Google’s trend explorer reveals the weekly number of worldwide searches for the keyword “bitcoin” has reached levels not seen since the first week in April.  While the exact number of searches accrued so far this week is not clear, data from Google reveals ‘bitcoin’ searches in the past three days alone made up 17 percent of its all-time-high weekly search volume set from Dec. 17-23, 2017.  At that time, the cryptocurrency was trading around its record high near $20,000, while at the time of writing, it is valued at $4,167 according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).   Google trend data further reveals that the most searches for bitcoin in the world over the past week came from Nigeria, South Africa and Austria, in that order. Interestingly, the U.S. barely cracked into the top-20, ranking in at 19.  The seven-month high in Google searches for bitcoin perhaps should not come as a surprise since the cryptocurrency made headlines last week for its price falling to a 13-month low below $4,000. Data further reveals the searches for bitcoin more than doubled on the day it entered the $3,000 range, Nov. 24. That said, it has long been speculated that the price of bitcoin and its Google search trends are highly correlated, which suggests the uptick may be a sign of things to come for bitcoin’s price. A study conducted in 2017 by researcher Willy Woo shows that the Google search trends can even be used to detect speculative bubbles as well as the best and worst times to buy the cryptocurrency. In other words, periods of low ‘bitcoin’ search volume have historically shown to be the points of maximum financial opportunity, whereas periods of abnormally high search volume tend to act as a warning sign that bitcoin is in a bubble and may soon experience a pullback in price.

1," Nasdaq Inc. is still planning to launch its Bitcoin futures early next year, Bloomberg reported early this morning. Two individuals familiar with the Bitcoin project told Benjamin Bain, a reporter at Bloomberg, that despite the downturned market the index still plans on offering these contracts. Bitcoin (BTC) has plunged nearly -75% since the beginning of the year and interest in digital currencies has dramatically decreased. Still, the Wall Street exchange feels there is enough investor interest to continue its plans. One of the individuals at Nasdaq told Bloomberg that the company has been working diligently to satisfy the concerns of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission before launch. The first Bitcoin futures were launched mid-December 2017 by the CME Group Inc. and CBOE Global Markets Inc. Bitcoin (BTC) saw its record high of nearly $20,000 a coin after the first set of Bitcoin futures were launched. At press time, BTC is currently trading at just over $3,700. In December, many thought that these future contracts would usher in a new wave of investment from Wall Street investors, but the fall of digital currencies in 2018 proves that wasn’t the case. >> Bitcoin Cash Hash War: Who Won? Nasdaq hopes to launch its Bitcoin futures in Q1 2019. The futures offered in January will be based off Bitcoin’s price on numerous spot exchanges, said Nasdaq.com CEO Adena Friedman. The figures will be compiled by VenEck Associates Corp. The CME uses prices from four different markets, while the CBOE uses just one. Nasdaq isn’t the only impending Bitcoin derivative though. The New York Stock Exchange owner, Intercontinental Exchange Inc., plans on launching its contracts in late January 2019. There has yet to be an official announcement from Nasdaq Inc., and the reports published by Bloomberg seem to be from unofficial sources. The major exchange could still pull the plug on its plans on Bitcoin futures, especially if Bitcoin (BTC) continues to drop. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© konstantin32"
1," A module called event-stream, used in millions of web applications but notably in BitPay’s open-source Bitcoin wallet Copay has reportedly been compromised, potentially leaving some other wallets vulnerable as well.  BitPay published an advisory saying Copay versions 5.0.2 through 5.1.0 were affected by the malicious code and that users with these versions installed should avoid running or opening the app until they install Copay version 5.2.0. “Our team is continuing to investigate this issue and the extent of the vulnerability,” the official announcement reads. “Currently, we have only confirmed that the malicious code was deployed on versions 5.0.2 through 5.1.0 of our Copay and BitPay apps. However, the BitPay app was not vulnerable to the malicious code. We are still investigating whether this code vulnerability was ever exploited against Copay users.” Copay, the affected wallet, has more than 100,000 downloads of Android, while the number of users from other platforms like iOS or Windows is unknown. Any other wallets using this module might be affected as well, although as of the time of writing, none of them have come forward.  The problem stems from a GitHub user volunteering to take over the library in question, inject malware and patch it up to avoid detection. The user, known only as “right9ctrl,” took over maintenance of the module from its original creator, developer Dominic Tarr, who said that he had not maintained the repository in years. In short, the developer updated the module with malware and then hid it from view, but the numerous people who had already installed it remain affected. Well known developer Jameson Lopp explained:  The npm ""event-stream"" repository has been compromised; if you are using it in a project along with ""copay-dash"" then the malware will steal any private keys it can find. https://t.co/fAnH6ik1n9 ___
Jackson Palmer, an Australian entrepreneur and technologist best known for creating the infamously successful ""joke"" cryptocurrency Dogecoin, added: This is one of the major issues with JavaScript-based cryptocurrency wallets with heavy up-stream dependencies coming from NPM. @BitPay essentially trusted all the up-stream developers to never inject malicious code into their wallet.@dominictarr also let the attacker in, sadly Event-stream is downloaded roughly two million times a week by application programmers for many different uses. The version with the malware in it, Event-Stream v 3.3.6, was published on September 9 via Node Package Manager (NPM) repository, and had since been downloaded by nearly 8 million application programmers.  The malicious code supposedly attempted to steal digital coins stored in the Dash Copay Bitcoin wallets - distributed through the NPM - and transfer them to a server located in Kuala Lumpur.

1," Bitcoin price started a short term correction recently after a drop below USD 3,800. BTC/USD corrected above USD 4,000 and USD 4,100, but it struggled to clear the USD 4,200 barrier. Later, the price declined again and settled below USD 4,000, which is a bearish sign. Similarly, ethereum price failed to break an important resistance near USD 120 and started a fresh downward move. Ripple price also struggled to gain traction above USD 0.400, resulting in bearish moves. Going forward, if bitcoin and altcoins struggle to break key pivot levels, there could be yet another bearish wave below recent lows in the near term. Total market capitalization  Recently, there was a recovery above the USD 4,000 resistance in bitcoin price , but buyers struggled to retain strength. BTC/USD topped near the USD 4,200 level and started a fresh downward move. It broke the USD 4,000 and USD 3,800 levels to move back in a bearish zone.
The price is down around 6% (UTC 08:30 AM) and it seems like it could decline further below the USD 3,750 and USD 3,620 support levels. In the worst case scenario, the price may even break the recent low and trade below the USD 3,500 level. Ethereum price  recovered more than USD 15, but it struggled near a crucial resistance at USD 120. ETH/USD faced a solid selling interest near USD 120, which resulted in a bearish reaction.
The price declined below USD 115 and USD 110 and it is currently down around 6%. An immediate support is at USD 105, below which there is a risk of a downside break below the key USD 100 support. The main resistances on the upside are at USD 115 and USD 120. Bitcoin cash  ABC rallied above the USD 200 and USD 220 resistance levels. However, BCHABC failed to stay above USD 200 and later declined heavily. The price is currently trading near USD 180 and it seems like it could test the USD 170 support. On the other hand, BCHSV rallied above the USD 100 level and traded as high as USD 140. It is currently consolidating above USD 100 with positive moves.
Ripple price  recovered above the USD 0.385 resistance, but it struggled to clear the USD 0.400 resistance. XRP/USD is down 5% to USD 0.358 and it could revisit the USD 0.340 support. Many small cap altcoins declined recently more than 10%, including SRN, FCT, MITH, STEEM, ONT, MAID, REP, WAN, GNT and ODE. Out of these, SRN declined around 26% and FCT is down nearly 25%. Overall, bitcoin price is back below the key USD 4,000 support, which is a bearish sign. If BTC/USD fails to jump above USD 4,000 and USD 4,200, there is a risk of more losses below the USD 3,500 level in the near term. Similarly, there could be an increase in selling pressure on altcoins like ethereum, ripple, BCH, neo and litecoin if they fail to start a fresh rebound in the next few hours.

1," The current cryptocurrency price crash is taking its toll on miners in China and Russia, with media outlets in both countries reporting mass shutdowns and equipment sell-offs. However, some experts in both countries believe that fresh opportunities may well arise following the market panic. Some are sensing a possible upside, and are choosing to stay in the game. Chinese media outlet Caixin quotes the COO of Chinese company Mining Sea, which operates farms in Yunnan, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia as stating, “We have yet to switch off our machines as we also offer financial products to help clients control for such risks.” The COO also stated miners could possibly “acquire more coins” now as rivals “have temporarily stopped running their machines.” And Russian media outlet Kommersant quotes the co-founder of the ICG cryptocurrency fund as stating that although “the Russian home miner is gradually disappearing,” big businesses in the country are ready to step in with superior technology – perhaps leading to a second boom in mining. However, for many it's still a challenging period and bitcoin miners are increasingly feeling the pressure to sell their coins.  Caixin quotes a mining industry insider as stating that some miners in the country have “halted operations” as Bitcoin prices have dropped below “shutdown price,” the level below which mining effectively ceases to be profitable. F2pool, one of the largest mining pools in China, stated that Bitcoin prices had dropped below shutdown price for miners paying USD 0.05/KwH for electricity and using Bitmain’s Antminer S7, Avalon’s Miner A741 and the lower-frequency version of the USED Whatsminer M3+. F2pool officials  also claimed, earlier this week, that between 600,000 and 800,000 Bitcoin miners have pulled the plug on their operations in the past two weeks. Meanwhile, in Russia, Kommersant quotes the co-founder of mining farm operator and hardware maker RMC as stating mining farm facilities had “temporarily suspended activities at the request of project participants, as the cost of electricity currently exceeds the income made from mining.” The company says it will push ahead, however, with plans to build parts for new altcoin mining hardware. Marketplace app Youla, Russia’s answer to eBay, has reported a 25% rise in the amount of mining equipment listings, as well as “a simultaneous drop” in bid prices, for both ready-made mining rigs and video cards. Youla noted that the terms “mining” and “Bitcoin” were now being searched for four times less often than at the beginning of the year – when Russia was in the grip of its mining boom.

0," After a dark red weekend in the crypto market, both bitcoin and major altcoins rebounded strongly on Sunday and Monday morning. Over the past 24 hours (UTC 07:10 AM), bitcoin has shot up more than 8% from its weekend lows below the USD 3,500 level. From a technical analysis-perspective, bitcoin and other major coins now appear to have found some support around levels established all the way back in September 2017. The question, however, is whether this level will hold, or if the market needs to search even lower to find a bottom. Top 10 coins (UTC 07:10 AM): Following the massive decline in the size of the cryptocurrency market, the market capitalization of the entire crypto market has now shrunk to around USD 130 billion, from a peak of 822 billion in January this year.  Therefore, more than 50 of the largest publicly traded companies in the world now have market cap’s that are larger than the entire crypto market. This includes all of the famous tech companies – the so-called FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) group of stocks – but also many smaller companies like McDonald’s, Walt Disney, and MasterCard. Among the biggest losers during the recent wave of crypto selling has been Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which was hit hard by the internal fighting between the Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV camps. The dust in that battle now seems to have settled with Bitcoin ABC emerging as the winner, but it has nonetheless caused heavy losses in the BCH price, as it fell from over USD 380 a week ago to just USD 167 as of press time. Bitcoin Cash also briefly lost its number 4 spot to EOS, although this has been reversed Monday morning. Although the market seems to have found at least some support for now, volatility may be coming back to bitcoin soon. On Friday (Nov 30), bitcoin futures on the CME Group exchange are set to expire – a monthly occasion which some suggest have caused bitcoin sell-offs in the past. However, the link between bitcoin futures expiries and sell-offs – or rallies – in the “physical” bitcoin market is highly uncertain, and the last year has shown that other futures expiry dates have been rather uneventful in the bitcoin market."
0," Businesses in America’s Ohio have been given the green light to pay their tax bills in cryptocurrencies, says the state’s treasurer. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, treasurer Josh Mandel explained that as of November 26 companies throughout the state could register and pay for a whole range of taxes via the OhioCrypto platform, using Bitcoin. The treasurer is quoted as stating, “I see [Bitcoin] as a legitimate form of currency.” Per the Wall Street Journal’s report, the state’s platform also hopes to begin accepting other cryptocurrencies, and hopes to allow “eventually” individuals in Ohio to pay taxes using the platform. A number of other American states have launched similar bids, including Illinois, Arizona and Georgia, but none have yet succeeded in persuading local legislatures to accept proposals. The OhioCrypto platform appears to be the brainchild of BitPay, an Atlanta-based third-party blockchain payment service. For its part, BitPay appears to be optimistic about the future of Bitcoin, despite massive price drops in recent days. Meanwhile, BitPay's chief operating officer Sonny Singh last week told Bloomberg he was confident that Bitcoin prices would bounce back in 2019, hitting all-time highs. Singh stated, “By the end of Q1 or Q2, Bitcoin will emerge as a viable commodity.” He also said that an influx of “new players and miners engaging in the industry” would help drive a new price surge. Meanwhile, a museum in the state has also begun allowing cryptocurrency payments. As of earlier this month, visitors to the Great Lakes Science Center in Cleveland can pay for admission in Bitcoin.

0," Bitcoin’s 15-percent recovery from the 14-month low hit yesterday may have opened the doors for short-term price consolidation. The leading cryptocurrency by market value dropped through the support of the trendline connecting the August 2015 and August 2016 lows and fell to $3,474 yesterday – the lowest level since Sept. 17, 2017 (prices as per Bitstamp). At that level, BTC was down 38 percent from the highs above $6,300 seen two weeks ago. The drop was short-lived, however, and prices closed yesterday (as per UTC) at $3,939 – well above the trendline – validating the oversold conditions reported by the technical indicators. As a result, a bout of consolidation could be in the offing. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $3,920 on Bitstamp, having clocked a high of $4,069 earlier today. The 15 percent recovery, though, may turn out to be a “dead cat bounce” if the long-term trendline support, currently at $3,830 is again breached. Meanwhile, the prospects of a stronger corrective rally would improve if prices find acceptance above $4,000.  The bullish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) and the falling channel breakout in the 4-hour chart indicate a bearish-to-bullish trend change. As a result, a stronger recovery rally toward $4,461 (downward sloping 50-candle EMA) cannot be ruled out. Gains above that level may remain elusive as the stacking order of the 50-candle EMA below the 100-candle EMA, below the 200-candle EMA indicates the path of least resistance is on the downside.  Over on the daily chart, the RSI has created a bullish divergence (higher low). That pattern would gain credence if the RSI moves above 30.00 into the undersold territory. The primary trend, however, would remain bearish as long as both the 5- and 10-day EMAs are sloping downwards.  As seen in the above chart, BTC is now trapped between the former support-turned-resistance of the 200-week EMA, currently at $4,174, and the three-year-long rising trendline support. Acceptance below the trendline support of $3,830 would invalidate the signs of revival seen in the 4-hour and daily chart.

1," With bitcoin prices dropping further early on Sunday, the cryptocurrency now looks to be heading for its worst weekly loss in over 5 years. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading at $3,520 on Bitstamp, representing a 36 percent drop from Monday’s opening price of $5,553. Unless the bulls can pull off a recovery, it’s looking to be the biggest weekly drop since the second week of April 2013, when prices fell 44.8 percent from $165  to $91. For the weekly loss to be confirmed on the charts, BTC must close today (as per UTC) below $3,887, or the resulting weekly loss would be the second biggest of 2018 – the first being the 30 percent drop witnessed in the last week of January. Bitcoin’s weekly performance  The 33-percent price drop is looking overdone, as per the 14-day relative strength index (RSI). The market, however, is paying no heed to the oversold conditions reported by that technical indicator. This is evident from the fact that BTC has continued to find sellers in the last 11 days, despite the record low reading on the RSI. BTC’s inability to produce a stronger corrective bounce despite oversold conditions indicates the “buy-the-dip” mentality is largely absent.  As seen above, BTC is currently trading below $3,760 – the support of the trendline connecting the August 2015 and August 2016 lows. A close below that level would bolster the already bearish technical setup, as represented by the convincing move below the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) support and the downward sloping 5- and 10-week EMAs.

0," The price of bitcoin fell below $4,000 for the first time today since September 27th of last year.  At around 16:20 UTC Saturday, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization sank to an average price across exchanges of $3,970.43, a figure 7.5 percent lower than the day’s opening price of $4,298.83, according to Coindesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.  At $3,745.89 as of press time, BTC’s price is now down more than $1,700, or 30 percent, in the past seven days alone and 81 percent from its all-time high of roughly $20,000, set back in December.   While several well-known cryptocurrencies are posting positive 24-hour price developments when valued against BTC, including the likes of XRP (XRP), ethereum (ETH) and dash (DASH) which are all up more than 2 percent in BTC terms, the broader market is still experiencing substantial losses vs. the USD.  Out of the world’s 10 largest cryptocurrencies, bitcoin cash (BCH), stellar (XLM), monero (XMR) and cardano (ADA) are the worst performers, all reporting 24-hour losses above 10 percent (vs. USD), according to data from Coinmarketcap. An effect of the plummet in cryptocurrency prices is a significant depreciation in the capitalization of the entire market. Just seven days ago, the market was valued at $182 billion, but that number has since fallen $54 billion, or 30 percent to where it now stands at $128 billion, its lowest value since September 2017.  Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.

0," Back in 2017, Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency took the spotlight in the media as investors and Wall Street began to take notice of digital currencies and the blockchain. Many executives in the major global banks shot down digital currencies almost immediately, as Bitcoin was a direct threat to their existence. See, Bitcoin was created to expose the currently flawed central banking system and to completely revamp the way individuals spend and send money. It remains unknown why crypto began to pick up speed towards the second half of 2017, but at the time, some digital currencies were seeing 100% gains in a single day. Cryptocurrency mining began to pick up as well, which became an extremely lucrative business at the time. Many businesses began completely changing their business models and centering them around digital token mining. Unfortunately, the equipment to ‘mine’ isn’t cheap. The process of generating new units of cryptocurrency by solving complex puzzles can often be expensive, due to the vast amounts of electricity that is needed. This doesn’t even include the hardware required. In January of 2018, no one predicted the fall of BTC and the rest of the crypto market. In 30 days, $500 billion was wiped off of the market. So, when Bitcoin’s price dropped, BTC mining was no longer economically viable. So what happens to those businesses that invested all that money into mining equipment and state-of-the-art mining facilities? Well, they run out of money. So far, the biggest casualty from the fall of digital currencies comes from the US-based mining firm Giga Watt. The company was forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after it was unable to pay its debts of around $7 million USD. >> Bitcoin’s Fall from Grace: Warren Buffett Said It All Along A large number of the world’s mining operations reside in China, and countless mining businesses have been forced to shut their doors.

0," Talk of the crypto-town is Bitcoin’s massive fall from grace. It seemed to be holding steady at around $6,300/$6,400 for most of October, but now it’s holding on for dear life. Mid-November saw the coin drop unprecedentedly. It began crashing and continues to today. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is priced at $4,2oo per coin and down a further 4% on the day. Some will blame Bitcoin Cash’s hard fork for creating an industry scare. Some will blame talk of regulatory scrutiny for rattling investors. But others will say, “I told you so” that Bitcoin’s crash was an inevitable eventuality and neither of the above possibilities could ever be a real reason for its fall. One such skeptic is Warren Buffett, who never bit the cryptocurrency line. He has continually spoken out against digital assets, maintaining “almost with certainty, that they will come to a bad ending.” Many people have lauded his type for his ‘outdated’ thinking; the world’s wealthiest investor who made his fortune playing the stock market was always going to dismiss cryptocurrency. Of course he was. But weren’t his concerns even partly founded? Bitcoin price has been decided by market speculation. It’s that simple really. And, for some, ‘speculation,’ means a mixed bag of exaggerations, lies, ideologies, and empty promises. It was this speculation that drove the market mania of last year. It was in 2017 that Bitcoin surged to the heights of almost $20,000 USD per coin. But like everything in this world, hype is usually met with an inevitable fall from grace. >> Colorado ICOs: Regulators Stop Another 18 ICOs Isn’t that really what Bitcoin is? A new technology that was hyped up to ‘replace’ the unfair and dated practices of our modern financial sector? If you were lucky enough to get in early before the hype, then you may have made yourself a pretty penny off of it. For everyone else, the idea of simply getting rich off of Bitcoin is nothing but a fantasy. The idea that any kind of financial platform couldn’t come with corruption and controversy is a pipe dream. So was Warren Buffett always right? Is this the beginning of the “bad end” for cryptocurrencies? Where Bitcoin goes, others tend to follow, and as it stands, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has fallen to around $138.6 billion since January 2018. This is a remarkable fall of 80%. Even more remarkable is that figure translates to almost $700 billion USD. Who’s getting rich now? *Mic Drop* Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Gesrey"
0," With bitcoin losing more than 30% of its value over the last week and a half alone, bitcoin miners are increasingly feeling the pressure as well. At USD 4,300, bitcoin is now at the lowest level seen since October 2017. Value of created bitcoins: ""Pretty concerning for small-time miners like me... Thankfully, I get extremely cheap power but it's hard to compete with economies of scale when some miners can buy hundreds of ASICs at a time,"" Reddit user PragmaticPleb wrote in a thread. ""I’m still running but the margins are thin and I might have to come out of pocket to cover some costs if the price drops even more. We’ll just have to do our best to weather this bear market and hopefully we can come out on the other side when the price begins to recover,"" IGotThisYo replied. Some large mining firms are already throwing in the towel. On Wednesday, it was reported that US-based mining form Giga Watt had filed for bankruptcy in Washington, still owing creditors nearly USD 7 million. According to another article by the South China Morning Post on Thursday, the China-based mining pool F2Pool now estimates that a range of mining machines, including the Antminer S7, S9, and AvalonMiner 741, has now become unprofitable to operate in China, leading to a flood of these machines being put up for sale on the second-hand market. Some, however, see opportunities when others are suffering. According to the same article, a miner by the name Jack Liao of the Shenzhen, China-based bitcoin mining firm Lightning Asic, has taken advantage of the slump to buy up second-hand mining machines at bargain prices. Liao told the newspaper that he has bought up about 50,000 mining machines, most of which are Antminer S9s, for about USD 70 each. A new S9 machine goes for around USD 300 from Bitmain’s website. Moreover, according to Nikkei, China's Bitmain Technologies Holding and Ebang International Holding, the two largest bitcoin mining equipment makers in the world, are widely expected to follow peers in delaying planned floats on the Hong Kong stock market, analysts warn, as regulatory headwinds and market volatility have disrupted plans by crypto-related companies to sell shares. As WhalePanda, an angel investor and bitcoin enthusiast, posted to Twitter, the losses that miners have suffered are already visible on the bitcoin hash rate: It will become easier to mine Bitcoin which of course benefits the miners who don't have to sell immediately since they can more easily stock up on $BTC and just wait out the bear market. Not every miner can do this though since (electricity) bills need to get paid. pic.twitter.com/t8ui3vznlP As a result, the difficulty rate of bitcoin mining has also begun to decline as more and more miners are switching off their machines. The difficulty has already declined two times this year, and it is likely that the next adjustment will bring the difficulty rate even lower. Moreover, it looks like the Bitcoin blockchain is also adding blocks at a slower rate than usual. Another casualty of the bear market: Bitcoin's inter-blocktime is actually getting longer. As hashpower comes offline, difficulty isn't reducing fast enough to cope, and Bitcoin is adding blocks at a slower rate than usual.https://t.co/IuY5cLP5zp pic.twitter.com/WPIg1sTkTR Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at online crypto and foreign exchange brokerage eToro, echoed the same sentiment, saying “miners are shutting down their rigs.” Bitcoin hashrate is now the lowest it's been since August. It's still up sharply since the start of the year but it seems clear that some miners are shutting down their rigs in face of lower BTC prices. pic.twitter.com/Og9AJM6FGt And since today is “Black Friday,” more or less desperate cloud mining companies, including the well-known Genesis Mining, are trying to push their mining contracts to new customers at discounted prices. However, as can be seen from the replies on Twitter, the community is not exactly impressed by the offering. 2/2 expire quicker and quicker, save your money and actually buy bitcoin then just HODL!"
0," Bitcoin’s defense of key long-term support for the second time in four days is a positive sign for a potential recovery rally. The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell below $4,242 (low of Wednesday’s inside-day candle) in the Asian trading hours, putting the bears back into the driver’s seat. As a result, BTC fell below the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) of $4,182 earlier today. The breach of the EMA support, however, may have trapped the bears on the wrong side of the market, as BTC is currently trading at $4,330 on Bitstamp, having clocked an intraday low of $4,061 earlier today. It is worth noting that the long-term EMA was first breached on Tuesday. The subsequent sell-off, however, ended at the 14-month low of $4,048 and prices recovered to $4,500 on the following day. The repeated failure to beat the long-term support indicates the bears have likely run out of steam. As a result, a stronger corrective rally could be in the offing.  On the 4-hour chart, the relative strength index (RSI) has created a bullish divergence with higher lows. As a result, BTC looks set to test $4,635 – the neckline of the double-bottom bullish reversal pattern. A break above that, if confirmed, would open up upside toward $5,100 (target as per the measured height method).  As seen above, the 14-day relative strength index is holding below 30.00 for the ninth day straight, signaling ongoing oversold conditions. The 5- and 10-day EMAs, currently at $4,546 and $4,933, respectively, are still trending south. Therefore, corrective rallies above the 10-day EMA, if any, could face exhaustion near $5,000.

0," Few projects have done as much to explore crypto micropayments as the year-old Yalls blog created by Lightning Labs developer Alex Bosworth. From April through early November, Bosworth said, blog participants have processed nearly 20,000 invoices with the Lightning Network, a bitcoin scaling solution that makes micropayments feasible by keeping them off the blockchain, sidestepping network transaction fees. It costs roughly one cent to read a Yalls article, half a cent to leave a comment on a post, and 10 cents to react to a post with an emoji. Publishing an article costs around 6 cents. “One nice thing about micropayments is that it brings back anonymity to the web,” Bosworth told CoinDesk. “I’m really a fan of the idea that your identity doesn’t have to be tied to a username and password.” Explaining that readers can tap into Yall’s Lightning node-and-channels system without a traditional subscription, like most paywalled outlets, he added: “Maybe you don’t even have a wallet yet … So you go to the Yalls app page, you can connect to it.” So far readers have opened more than 118 Lightning nodes through this platform, many of which are now facilitating payment channels, in which small amounts are sent back and forth between users before final settlement on the blockchain. This allowed contributors to post 170 new articles from July to early November 2018, while readers paid for 675 emoji reactions and 194 comments. Plus, writers have claimed their bite-sized crypto rewards at least 432 times during the same period, collecting the fees from readers for their articles. “It’s pennies, so every single invoice is small,” Bosworth said. As such, some node operators have been operating channels for several months, and according to Bosworth, earning roughly $5 a month on routing fees. While this hardly constitutes a business model for daily publishing, it highlights how engaged readership can contribute to a platform’s broader infrastructure. Speaking to how media outlets often find participatory ecosystems difficult to moderate, since trolls and marketers can flood comment sections at no cost, he added: “The micropayments help there, because then you don’t have robots or spam.” Since Bosworth created this blog as a hobby, with a corresponding Lightning node on-boarding process, he doesn’t regularly track readers or payments and provided the April-November data to CoinDesk on request. He hasn’t marketed the site or solicited contributions either. And yet, it’s clear that bitcoin fans are engaging. “In the beginning of the site there were problems keeping the node online. If the node died, you couldn’t read any articles or do anything on the site. I had to really babysit the node,” Bosworth said. “Over time, that feedback made its way back to LND [Lightning Network Daemon] and now the node is pretty stable.” On the other hand, Bosworth acknowledged it will take years for this type of community funding to work for professional media outlets. For starters, few people know how to operate a Lightning-friendly crypto wallet or node. General crypto-literacy is in short supply among mainstream audiences. Plus, syncing up wallets and nodes with the site itself takes time to develop in-house. According to Bosworth, readers were “pretty forgiving” when payments worth less than a penny had trouble processing. But “if you start to charge people like $20 a month or something, you have to provide a higher quality of service, that there’s never any bugs,” he said, adding that reliable infrastructure for one-click payments is the only way readers will use crypto micropayments for content on-the-go. “If the infrastructure were there, so that there were less mental costs on the user to make that payment,” he said, “I think it could take off.” Lightning image via Shutterstock"
0," French fintech company Keplerk has just made it possible for tobacco shop customers in France to buy bitcoins. The initiative affects 24,000 tobacco shops in the country where bitcoins will be offered as vouchers, which can be cashed in via Keplerk’s wallet. The company will take a 7% cut on every transaction as commission fees. “Tobacco shop owners are the best channel as they are trusted by customers, and they are used to sell vouchers such as credit for mobile phones,” Adil Zakhar, Keplerk’s director for strategy and development, was quoted as saying by Reuters. According to the Bank of France, the monetary authority will not supervise Keplerk’s project, but the institution has warned French citizens about the risks of buying cryptocurrencies. “Those are purely speculative assets and not currencies. Those who invest in bitcoin or other crypto-assets do it at their own risk,” the central bank said on November 21, 2018. Meanwhile, in March 2018, Cryptonews.com reported a similar event in Australia. From that date, Aussie crypto enthusiasts are able to purchase bitcoin and ether at 1,200 newsstands in the Oceanic country. The adoption was facilitated by the Australian cryptocurrency exchange Bitcoin.com.au.  Also, in July 2017, the Austrian startup BitPanda has partnered with the country’s postal service, the Österreichische Post, to offer cryptocurrency vouchers - including bitcoin, ether, litecoin, and dash - to the citizens of the European country. The coins are offered in denominations of 50, 100, and 500 EUR, which can be purchased in 10,400 branches of the Österreichische Post as well as in 1,300 postal partners of the organization."
0," The past three sessions were mostly neutral as there were range moves above the USD 4,400 and USD 4,500 support levels in bitcoin price. BTC/USD rebounded a few points, but it struggled to break the USD 4,750 and USD 4,800 resistance levels. Similarly, there was a minor upside correction in ethereum price above the USD 130 and USD 132 levels. However, buyers failed to push the price above the USD 140 and 145 resistance levels. The current price action is positive and it seems like major cryptocurrencies could consolidate above supports in the short term before the next move.  Total market capitalization  There was a decent upward move above the USD 4,600 level in bitcoin price . BTC/USD even traded above the USD 4,700 level. However, the price failed to surpass the USD 4,750 and USD 4,800 resistance levels. It is currently consolidating near USD 4,600 with a few positive moves.
On the downside, a break below USD 4,600 may push the price towards the USD 4,500 support area. The main support for the current wave is near USD 4,400, which is the lower end of the range. On the upside, a successful break above USD 4,750 and USD 4,800 is needed for buyers to gain bullish momentum in the near term. Ethereum price  managed to move above the USD 130 and USD 132 resistance levels. ETH/USD also traded above the USD 135 level, but it faced a strong resistance near the USD 140 - USD 142 area.
The price is currently trading in a range above the USD 132 level, below which the price could drop back towards the USD 125 support. On the upside, a successful break above USD 142 and USD 150 is needed for more gains. Bitcoin cash  ABC failed to stay above the USD 250 support and declined more than 4%. BCHABC is currently trading near USD 230, with an immediate support at USD 220. BCHSV declined sharply by more than 7% and traded below the USD 62 and 60 support levels. The next key support is at USD 55 and USD 50.
Ripple price  seems to be struggling to stay above the USD 0.450 and USD 0.460 levels. XRP/USD is down 2.2% and it could continue to correct lower towards the USD 0.435 support. A few small cap altcoins recovered between 8%-15% today, including NEXO, LRC, GNT, SNT, XIN, PIVX, MANA, REP and BAT. Out of these, NEXO climbed around 15% and LRC moved up close to 13%. To sum up, bitcoin price is trading with a short term positive bias above the USD 4,400 support. If BTC/USD manages to climb above the USD 4,750 and USD 4,800 resistance levels, there could be a decent rebound in the coming sessions. If not, there are chances of a fresh bearish wave in bitcoin and altcoins in the near term.

0," As the crypto sell-off is hitting mainstream media outlets, experts are being brought on to explain what is going on in the crypto markets, as well as share their thought on just how deep the rabbit hole is. In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Sonny Singh, chief commercial officer of the major bitcoin payment service provider BitPay, said that the bitcoin price, in his view, will not do much at all until there is a new catalyst to drive the market either higher or lower. According to Singh, such a catalyst could be Fidelity launching its much-anticipated crypto product, or “Bakkt launching their product, or Square launching their product, or Blackrock launching an ETF […]” However, “until such products come out,” Singh explained, “I don’t think there is much of a market catalyst moving bitcoin either way.” In either case, according to him, “Bitpay will process over a billion dollars again this year, even though the price of bitcoin has dropped 75%, because people are actually using bitcoin, whether it is as a store of value, a payment transact…There’s just different use-cases for it all over the world.” In conclusion, Singh said that he expects the bitcoin price to trade somewhere around USD 15,000 to USD 20,000 by the end of next year, as long as some of the “traditional companies” mentioned do launch their products. However, he added a word of caution, saying that “nothing moves fast in fin-tech.” Watch the entire Bloomberg interview with BitPay’s chief commercial officer Sonny Singh below: In a separate interview on the Bloomberg Markets podcast on Wednesday, chairman of London-based crypto asset management company CoinShares, Danny Masters, shared his insights on the current state of the crypto market and the new trend of so-called stablecoins in particular. When asked about his opinion on stablecoins, Masters said that the idea of “switching from volatile crypto assets to stable dollars, while remaining within this electronic environment […] is quite appealing.” “It’s an interesting development,” he said, while adding that “certainly there is demand for that digital dollar.”  Asked about the recent sell-off in the crypto markets, Masters admitted that it has been difficult for his company, saying “it’s certainly been a challenging week in the bitcoin space.” However, he also pointed out that when global stock markets first started to become more volatile a month ago, “bitcoin remained stable.” In the current phase, “the bears in bitcoin have definitely scored a win,” Masters said, while adding that as someone who has been around for a while “one tries not to become too excited when it goes up, and not too disappointed when it goes down.” Meanwhile, Lou Kerner, partner at CryptoOracle, an advisory and investment firm, told CNBC that ""If you go back to the internet bubble, which is what a lot of us in crypto look at for direction, Amazon, arguably one of the greatest companies in the history of the mankind, was down over 95% over two years."""
1," Tom Lee, the long-standing Wall Street crypto bull, is sticking to his $15,000 year-end price prediction for Bitcoin (BTC). The Fundstrat Global Advisor voiced his prediction on CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ yesterday. Bitcoin just recently fell to its lowest levels in more than a year yesterday, but Lee remains convinced. Originally, Lee cut his Bitcoin year-end prediction by $10,000—from $25,000 to $15,000. “Days like this, it does make me wonder,” said Lee to CNBC. “These past few days have definitely been a negative development.” The Fundstrat advisor contends that more oversight from US regulators and institutional involvement could push the prices of BTC up. Lee told CNBC that the upcoming launch of Bakkt, the digital assets platform run by the New York Stock Exchange, could peak investor interest as it is set to launch at the end of January 2019. Often, digital currencies see a ‘boost’ during a run-up to a major product launch. >> Bakkt Looks for Support for Its Next Futures Contract Elaborating more on his US regulation comment, Lee explained: “Once we have that [regulatory clarity], I think, institutions will feel more comfortable in making bets.” Lee isn’t the only one that remains bullish on cryptocurrency. Just recently, the Netherlands-based KPMG released another bull report on cryptocurrency. From its peak in early January 2018, the total cryptocurrency market has fallen over $600 billion USD. Uneducated investors flooded the cryptocurrency market around Thanksgiving of last year when the market remained consistently green for nearly 6-8 weeks. Around Christmas, the market took a stagnant turn, only to hit its record peak in the first week of January. When the market corrected after its peak, new crypto investors began panic selling. Many educated investors know correction in any market is inevitable, but those new to investing did not. Thus, the widespread dump of cryptocurrencies. Now, only those that truly believe in the power of Bitcoin and the blockchain remain! Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Elnur_"
1," Members of the crypto community are obviously not pleased with the news that the much-anticipated Bakkt futures trading platform may not come as soon as the market has been hoping for. Despite the importance of the Bakkt futures launch might be overestimated, the news trimmed Bitcoin’s gains yesterday.  Bitcoin price chart: ___ The community reacted: Thanks for stabbing bitcoin in the @BakkT ____ Tell that to my hungry kids. Shame on you Kelly! pic.twitter.com/Sclt2sQIFN Others blamed the news for the heavy sell-off in the crypto market over the past few days: Explains why the market tanked. Insiders knew before the rest of us.  I’m nvr selling btw! ____ This means they think we will hit bottom near end of January. ____ Whatever the reason for the delay may be, some speculate that it has more to do with low liquidity and little trading interest in the futures market, rather than “the volume of interest in Bakkt.” Speaking about the size of the bitcoin futures market back in August, Chris Concannon, president and chief operating officer of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) told Bloomberg: “I’ve learned that there’s been more articles than volume. It’s a little bit shocking to me the attention this market gets versus its size. The entire crypto market is a fifth of Apple.” CBOE and CME, an American financial market company operating an options and futures exchange, combined traded about 9,000 contracts a day in the third quarter, according to Bloomberg data. Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the University of Houston and an expert on futures trading, stressed in October that “Institutional players have stayed on the Bitcoin sidelines, and as long as they are, the futures contracts are likely not to generate substantial amounts of volume.”  Bakkt made a splash in the crypto world when it was first announced back in August, with the support of well-known brand names like Microsoft, BCG, and Starbucks. It was set up by the New York-based Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), and aims to offer 1-day physically settled bitcoin futures for institutional clients from its base in the US. Many in the crypto community have expressed great hopes that the company can help boost institutional interest in cryptocurrency, and possibly be a catalyst for the next wave of buying in the market. Now, according to the new update from Bakkt’s CEO Kelly Loeffler, the launch date of the institutional-grade trading and “warehousing” platform will be pushed back to January 24, 2019, from an originally scheduled release in December of this year. The new release date is still subject to regulatory approvals, and the company promises to keep the community updated on progress and relevant milestones as the launch approaches. “Given the volume of interest in Bakkt and work required to get all of the pieces in place, we will now be targeting January 24, 2019 for our launch to ensure that our participants are ready to trade on Day 1,” Loeffler wrote in the statement. Whether the recent market crash has something to do with Bakkt is currently one of the popular topics in the community, and many are joking that traditional investors want to “buy the dip.” “When retail investors miss the train, they miss the train. When institutions miss the train, they bring the train back,” Reddit user u/Subfolded quoted a Wall Street saying. This seems to be the general consensus: that the prices are being manipulated by whales that want institutional investors to enter the market below its real value. However, there is also a smaller group of people that just don’t see it: u/McDonald5 sarcastically writes, “Get your tin foil hat ready, it's a CONSPIRACY!” The first group, meanwhile, is the significantly louder one. “Bitcoin was very stable over the last few month but suddenly right before ETFs and BAKKT, everything drops. It’s only my opinion but a lot of money can enter with ETFs and a drop just doesn’t make sense. Normally we get pumps from news like this and dumps when it’s released. This time I feel like somebody is making sure opposite happens,” writes u/toohottoospicy.  u/Raymikqwer replies, “I feel like the majority of Reddit seems to think everything is conspiracy involving whales or some other nonsense. There’s always the possibility that everything was just MASSIVELY overbought in December/January and it’s still correcting to a price the market deems as fair.”"
1," Bitcoin (BTC) could be in for a stronger recovery rally in the next few days, having found a temporary bottom near $4,000. The leading cryptocurrency, which hit a 14-month low of $4,048 on Bitstamp yesterday, is now trading at $4,580, representing a 2 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. The $500 recovery seen yesterday indicates that the market is finally paying heed to the record oversold levels reported by the 14-day relative strength index (RSI). Currently, the indicator is still hovering in oversold territory below 30.00. As a result, BTC is unlikely to revisit yesterday’s low of $4,048 for now. Further, the correction looks set to gather pace, as the RSI on the 3-day chart has dropped into the oversold region for the first time since January 2015.  Oversold readings on the RSI tend to put a bid under the cryptocurrency, historical charts show. For instance, BTC bottomed out at $275 in the first week of October 2014 – with the sell-off looking overdone as per the RSI – and rose to highs above $400 in the next few days. On similar lines, the oversold conditions signaled by the RSI in January 2015 likely triggered a recovery rally, pushing prices above $300 by mid-month. As of writing, the RSI is hovering well below 30.00. Therefore, the cryptocurrency looks due for a break above $5,000.  The bullish RSI divergence, seen on both the hourly and 4-hour charts, also indicates the recent sell-off has likely run out of steam near $4,000 and a relief rally could be in the offing.  On the daily, the primary trend remains bearish, as the 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) are sloping downwards. These averages, currently at $4,854 and $5,242, respectively, could cap any corrective rally. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

0," As the overall crypto market is seeing a another huge wave of selling, all top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are down by more than 70% from their all-time highs (ATH) (well, except stablecoins.) Since its all-time high in December 2017, bitcoin is now down nearly 77%, ether - 90%, ripple - 88%, litecoin - 91%, according to OnChainFX data.  Now, the price of the number one cryptocurrency, bitcoin, is down 15% over the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, the only coins in the top 100 that are in the green are a couple of USD-pegged stablecoins, with many major coins being down between 10% and 20%. Top 10 coins: (UTC 06:40 AM) The losses overnight follow a similar sell-off from Wednesday last week, when bitcoin also shredded off more than 10%. As has been the trend over the past few days, Ripple’s XRP has held up great in the sea of red numbers with a 24 hour decline of just below 1%. According to some commentators, Ripple may be getting some of its stability from being a very different cryptocurrency, as it aims to work within the current banking system rather than replacing it. 
UPDATED (UTC 09:20) Ripple price was stable earlier during the day, but later buyers gave up and sellers took control below the USD 0.460 support.  Another possible explanation is that the drama following the Bitcoin Cash split has affected the rest of the crypto space, and in particular other proof-of-work-based assets like bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash was one of the hardest-hit coins last night, falling more than 40%. As the crypto market hits rock bottom once again, some still see opportunities in the space. According to Spencer Bogart, partner at the crypto-focused investment firm Blockchain Capital, there is still a “gigantic” opportunity in the crypto space, and in particular in projects that are related to bitcoin, or “programmable money,” as Bogart calls it. “I still believe that programmable money in a multi-trillion-dollar idea. Right now, we’re in a bear market, but we’re coming off one of the biggest bull markets of all time,” Bogart told Bloomberg on Monday. Meanwhile, Stephen Palley, Anderson Kill partner, reacts to Bitcoin tumbling below the USD 5,000 mark by saying he doesn't see a connection or causal relationship between recent SEC (The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) activity and the price of cryptocurrency. At the same time, the cryptoverse met another crash with emotions, attempts of inspiration, insights and jokes, of course.

0," A total of $60 billion has been erased from the value of all cryptocurrencies over the last week, a decline that has many wondering if the ongoing bear market for the asset class has finally come to an end. Defined as a period of depressed activity and sentiment, the bear market has seen the price of bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, decline more than 75 percent from all-time highs set in January. Further, as bitcoin makes up more than 50 percent of the entire market in terms of total capitalization, it’s safe to say the bear market may end when bitcoin bulls refuse to cede more ground. But in order for a true ‘bottom’ to be found, many figure a “capitulation” needs to take place, since it is traditionally the last stage of a prolonged bear market.  By definition, capitulation is characterized by extreme panic selling backed by high volume that builds momentum until an eventual “bottom” is found. The bottom is a price level where the asset looks too cheap or undervalued to investors for them to allow it to fall any further.  It’s difficult to consider something to have officially capitulated until after it has occurred, but by looking at previous capitulation stages and market bottoms for BTC, there are a few signs traders and investors alike can watch out for that may allude to an official market bottom From 2013-2015, BTC experienced a bear market similar to the one occurring now, in which it reached an all-time high of $1,163 in November, 2013 and eventually fell 86 percent to bottom out at $152 in January, 2015.  From that day forward, the price never retreated below $152, according to data from the Bitstamp exchange. If that particular market bottom is an example of true capitulation, it’s clear there are two factors paramount to achieving capitulation: volume climaxes and rapid price declines.   As can be seen in the above chart, the sell-off for BTC began to accelerate at the beginning of 2015, but did not reach an extreme until two weeks later. On Jan. 15, fear and panic in the market reached its peak. The price of BTC dropped 30 percent in a single 4-hour candlestick that was backed by its most sell volume in several months – an extreme selling event like this creates a volume climax which tends to be the precursor to a market bottom. The sign that likely cemented this point in time as the bottom was what followed the selling climax – even more buy volume. At this point, fear in the market officially met demand and those still interested in BTC considered the $152 price tag too cheap to let it slip any further.  As can be seen below, the market is again experiencing a significant sell-off, but so far has been more gradual than the capitulation experienced in 2015.  This is evident in that no single 4-hour candlestick has recorded more than a 9 percent loss whereas the single “market bottoming” four-hour candlestick in 2015 recorded a 30 percent loss. That said, sell volume has clearly picked up pace over the last couple of days and the current four-hour chart is showing promising signs for an “at least temporary” bottom.  As can be seen in the above chart, sell volume is beginning to lessen and diverge from the falling price, a sign sell orders are drying up. What’s more, the last four-hour candle just bullishly engulfed the prior candlestick with a notable uptick in buying volume.  A candle is considered to be ‘bullish engulfing’ when its body completely covers that of the prior candle, these types of candle tend to form at the bottom of downtrends but are more powerful the higher the timeframe.  Should be noted, capitulation events do not immediately reverse the long-term trend of a market. After BTC bottomed out in Jan. 2015, it largely traveled sideways for another 10 months before beginning a new uptrend toward the end of the year. Such extreme selling events are also very rare, so it’s unlikely for the exact market conditions of 2015 to be replicated this time around. It’s safe to say though when true capitulation occurs, you’ll know. Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.

0," Bitcoin’s drop to 13-month lows has likely put the cryptocurrency on the path to post its worst monthly loss of 2018. The leading cryptocurrency is currently trading at roughly $4,700 – down roughly 26 percent from the monthly opening price of $6,320 – according to CoinDesk market data. As of now, November is the second-worst month of 2018, the first being March with a 32 percent price drop. November, however, would take the top spot if prices find acceptance below $4,200, pushing the monthly loss above 32 percent.  Indeed, BTC could regain some poise in the next ten days, as the record low on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is signaling extreme oversold conditions. In that case, November may become the second-worst month of the year or may even slip lower. However, a monthly loss looks like a done deal as a rally all the way back to $6,320 is unlikely to happen in the near-term.  This is because the demand side pressures may have weakened significantly in the last few days.  Moreover, a significant majority was expecting BTC to end its prolonged period of consolidation with a bullish breakout. The cryptocurrency, however, fell below $6,000 –  a level where prices had supposedly carved out a long-term bottom – trapping many on the wrong side of the market.

0," Bitcoin’s price continues to slide despite the oversold conditions signaled on the technical charts for the last six days. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell to $4,200 soon before press time – a price low not seen since Oct. 5, 2017 – and was last seen trading at $4,484, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Notably, the 14 percent drop witnessed in the last 24 hours has pushed the widely followed 14-day relative strength index (RSI) below 10.00, its lowest reading on record. An asset is considered to be oversold and due for a corrective bounce when its RSI is below 30.00. BTC’s RSI fell into oversold territory on Nov. 14, but a strong recovery rally has still not materialized. That said, a corrective bounce might be seen in the next 24 hours or so, as the low on the RSI is backed by a rise in BTC/USD longs.  As seen above, BTC has dropped 34 percent in the last five days, despite being so oversold. The cryptocurrency’s inability to produce a notable recovery rally in such conditions could be considered a sign that bearish sentiment is currently very strong. Still, the bears should exercise caution in the next 24 hours.  As seen above, long positions hit a 3.5-month high of 31,719 earlier today, having risen 34 percent in the last six days – both of which indicate that investors are buying the current dip.  A corrective bounce, if any, will likely be short-lived as both descending triangle breakdown and the break of the seven-year-long rising trendline has likely set the tone for a drop to $4,100 (trendline connecting the January 2015 and April 2017 lows.)

0," Bitcoin has hit its lowest level again this year. Is it the beginning of the end for Bitcoin? I bet that question has been asked many times over in 2018. Bitcoin gained house-hold name status around Thanksgiving last year. That was the kind of year Bitcoin had in 2017. But now, Bitcoin is down more than 30% since Thanksgiving 2017. But that’s not as bad as being down 60% on the year, 18% this week alone, and hitting the lowest level of 2018 today. At the time of writing, BTC is selling for $5,148 and is down nearly 9% on the day. As is the industry standard, Bitcoin tends to lead the pack; other major cryptocurrencies are down, with Ethereum and Ripple losing over 12% and 4.5% respectively. In fact, this loss is so significant for Ethereum that Ripple has just overtaken it in terms of market cap. Now Ripple is the second most valuable cryptocurrency in the world. Ethereum is third. All in a week’s work. Bitcoin’s lowest level came unexpectedly—BTC had remained around the $6,400 range for most of October despite the rest of the global markets going through sell-offs. It was around this time last year when Bitcoin began its epic rise, first topping $10,000 at the end of November and was worth almost $20,000 per coin by Christmas. The CBOE brought in the first Bitcoin futures trading platform on December 10th, but prices hit their peak the same day the CME began Bitcoin futures trading on December 17th. The futures market gave investors the ability to bet on the decline of Bitcoin price. It was the ultimate gambling platform—Bitcoin, with a value derived from speculation and nothing tangible, could now make investors even more money by betting on, effectively, market speculation. >> IDEX Lists Ride Sharing Company RedCab LLC’s REDC Token But today paints a different story. This past week has wiped approximately $40 billion off the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization. According to eToro analyst Mati Greenspan: “The next logical level of support is at $5,000 but if that doesn’t hold, the next logical support level isn’t until $3,500. With all the falling prices lately, this definitely fits the definition of a buyers market.” But do you think anyone is expecting Bitcoin to really kick off again? Do you think if you bought in now that the coin might repeat the good old days of 2017? Something tells me betting on its decline these days makes for an easier prediction.

0," After Tom Lee, a popular crypto analyst, cut his Bitcoin price forecast for this year to USD 15,000, the cryptoverse is still not convinced that the price might triple in less than two months. According to Lee, the level at which mining costs match the trading price is down to USD 7,000 from an earlier estimate of USD 8,000 for the S9 mining machine by Bitmain, CNBC reported last Friday. The head of Fundstrat Global Advisors, a market analyst company, estimates that fair value for bitcoin would be roughly 2.2 times the new USD 7,000 break-even price, therefore Bitcoin should stand at around USD 15,000. Less than a month ago, he was convinced that Bitcoin could still surpass USD 20,000 - even in spite of the almost year-long bear market.  Bitcoin price chart: The analyst also stressed that the recent drop in the market led to a renewed wave of pessimism: “We believe the negative swing in sentiment is much worse than the fundamental implications”. However, according to Lee, a price recovery is possible. He believes that the wave of institutions (Bakkt, Fidelity) - that are expected to enter the market at the end of 2018 - could bring Bitcoin bulls back.  Meanwhile, Sven Henrich, founder of NorthmanTrader, a market analysis firm, published this chart that compares Lee's predictions and Bitcoin price: (Click on Henrich's tweet to see the whole chart below.) Henrich’s followers on Twitter reacted:  Year end $15k???? That’s almost a triple in 6 weeks. Other members of the cryptoverse have also offered their opinion:  pic.twitter.com/36BKDs8C8e Back in 2017, Lee stated that he believes “Bitcoin is your best investment until the end of the year.” According to him, people see Bitcoin as the older generations have been seeing gold in the 1980s: a hedge against fiat currencies. If Bitcoin captures the ""5% of just the gold market, it's USD 25,000. But 5% seems like an awfully small number. Let's say it's 10 or 15. Then bitcoin could easily be in the USD 100,000 range,” he said back then."
0," This past week, we saw heavy declines in bitcoin below the USD 6,000 support area. BTC/USD remained in a bearish zone and opened with a negative tone this week. The price recently broke the USD 5,500 support and traded to a new 2018 low. Similarly, ethereum was under a lot of selling pressure as it broke the USD 175 support. It is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) down more than 10% and it seems like sellers are in control below USD 160. Both BCHABC and BCHSV declined heavily below the USD 250 and USD 100 supports respectively. The current market sentiment is clearly bearish and it seems like bitcoin could extend declines towards USD 5,000 in the coming sessions. Total market capitalization  There were heavy bearish moves below the USD 5,600 level in bitcoin price . BTC/USD traded below the USD 5,550 and USD 5,400 support levels recently to move further into a bearish zone. A new 2018 high was formed near USD 5,300 and it seems like the price could continue to move down in the near term.
The main weekly support level is at USD 5,000, below which there is an open space up to USD 4,400. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 5,500, above which the price could recover towards the USD 5,750 level. The key weekly resistance is at USD 6,000, which was a crucial support earlier. Ethereum price  fell during the past few hours and declined below the USD 170 and USD 160 support levels. ETH/USD is currently down around 13% to USD 155.
An immediate support is at USD 150, below which the price could tumble towards the USD 130 level. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 170, above which the price could test USD 180. The main weekly hurdle for buyers is near the USD 195 level. Both Bitcoin cash  coins are down significantly. BCHABC is down around 15% and it recently traded below the USD 250 support. The next major support for buyers is near the USD 200 level. BCHSV collapsed and declined roughly 30% to USD 90. If it continues to decline, it could test the USD 80 level in the near term.
Ripple price  recovered recently, but buyers failed to hold gains above the USD 0.520 and USD 0.505 levels. XRP/USD followed bitcoin’s path and declined around 5%. It is currently trading near USD 0.475 and it could test the USD 0.450 level. Many altcoins declined heavily and registered losses between 15%-20%, including LRC, ICX, WAN, AION, ELF, SRN, VET, IOST and MKR. Out of these, LRC is down 18% and ICX declined 17%. To sum up, bitcoin and altcoins moved further into the red zone. BTC/USD may perhaps continue to decline towards USD 5,000 and if buyers fail to defend more losses, the price could tumble. Similarly, ethereum must stay above the USD 150 level to avoid a drop towards the USD 130 and USD 125 levels in the near future.

0," Bitcoin dropped below $5,000 for the first time in over 13 months on Monday. CoinDesk price data reveals the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell to $4,981 shortly after 16:30 UTC on Monday, signifying a dollar-decline of more than $500 for the day when the move occurred. That’s the lowest figure since Oct. 12, 2017, and as of press time, the price has recovered somewhat to $5,048 – still signifying a decline of more than 9 percent.  The broader cryptocurrency market accompanied BTC in its steep sell-off and has shed more than $15 billion in total market capitalization in the last 24 hours.   Many cryptocurrencies are faring worse than BTC, including the likes of ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC) and EOS, all of which are posting 24-hour losses above 10 percent. According to data from OnChainFX, some of the biggest losses of the day include Aragon, LBRY Credits and ZClassic, all of which have seen price declines in excess of 20 percent in the past day.

0," Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to its lowest level since October 2017 on Monday, amid a broader period declines for the world’s top cryptocurrencies. The leading cryptocurrency fell to $5,165 earlier today – the lowest level since Oct. 18, 2017 – having breached the crucial support of $6,000 last week. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $5,283 – down 5 percent on a 24-hour basis and 16 percent week-on-week – according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Further, the year-on-year loss now stands at 32 percent, as prices were trading well above $7,600 on Nov. 19, 2017. Elsewhere, ethereum’s ETH token, cardano and Tron are also flashing double-digit losses on a 24- hour basis. Notably, ETH fell to $155 earlier today, the lowest level since July 16, 2017, as per CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, XRP, the second-largest cryptocurrency as per market capitalization, is reporting a 6.5 percent drop. Only nine out of top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are trading in the green and three out of the nine are stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies. The sharp losses in the major cryptocurrencies have pushed the total market capitalization down to a 13-month low of $172 billion. In the last five days, the total value has dropped by more than $30 billion. The risk aversion could worsen in the near-term, as bitcoin is looking increasingly weak on the technical charts. As seen above, BTC closed last week (UTC) at $5,560, confirming a downside break of the nine-month-long descending channel – a bearish continuation pattern. The cryptocurrency also closed below the 100-week exponential moving average (EMA), which had been acting as support since June. More importantly, both 50- and 100-week EMAs have shed bullish bias. The 14-week relative strength index (RSI) of 37.00 is signaling scope for a deeper sell-off. Therefore, BTC risks falling below the psychological support $5,000 in the near term. Major support below that level is seen around $4,100 (trendline connecting the January 2015 and April 2017 lows.)  Over on the daily chart, the RSI of 15 is indicating that the sell-off is overdone. Hence, a sustained break below the psychological support of $5,000 looks unlikely in the short-term.  The RSI on the 4-hour chart is creating a higher low, despite the lower low on the price chart, marking the development of a bullish divergence. The divergence would be confirmed if the RSI continues to post higher lows and the 4-hour candle closes in the green. That would open the doors to a corrective rally.

0," “Big four” accounting firm KPMG says that assets like Bitcoin are not truly currencies yet, but that “a new world of finance is emerging in which transacting in cryptoassets may become standard procedure.” To drive the space towards this new world, they believe that institutionalization is necessary in order to “build trust, facilitate scale, increase accessibility, and drive growth.” The paper, titled Institutionalization of Cryptocurrencies, covers the challenges facing the cryptocurrency industry, as it seeks adoption by the world’s largest financial institutions. They define institutionalization as the at-scale participation in the cryptocurrency market of banks, broker dealers, exchanges, payment providers, fintech companies, and other entities in the global financial services ecosystem. ""New tokens and assets are one thing, but new business models and market participants may redefine the space significantly over the next few years,"" according to KPMG. For Bitcoin and other assets to “truly become a currency,” KPMG believes that there will be three criteria to be met: being used as a unit of account, a store of value, and a unit of exchange. While it may meet the requirement of a “unit of account” to a certain extent, KPMG chief economist Constance Hunter believes that the assets are too unstable to be considered a store of value. “Consider for a moment extending a person or entity a loan in a cryptocurrency. The value is too unstable at the moment to be assured repayment. Under these conditions, neither lenders nor borrowers would be willing to take the risk of transacting in cryptocurrencies,” she explains. As for the final qualification - unit of exchange - Hunter adds, “In order to be a medium of exchange, a crypto must be a store of value. In order to be a store of value, the speculative nature of crypto must dissipate. Until at least one crypto meets all three criteria, they cannot be considered full currencies.” But once cryptocurrencies meet all three of these criteria, the financial world as we know it might well change. “If a crypto could achieve enough stability of value to be used for this purpose, it could eliminate the need to have bank accounts in multiple countries and could allow individuals to transfer money to anyone without paying wire fees. If a fully equipped crypto that has a stable value becomes easier and less expensive to transact than a government-issued fiat currency, it could be an innovation that becomes ubiquitous in the global financial services system,” Hunter believes. However, up until now, companies that have looked towards institutionalization have often faced immediate backlash from the community. One example is peer-to-peer crypto trading platform ShapeShift, which has announced mandatory KYC (know your customer) to be implemented very soon - to the disgruntlement of Bitcoin maximalists, who believed that this platform was one of the few remaining ones following “Satoshi’s vision.” Another recent example are stablecoins which have backdoors to allow them to freeze assets and blacklist addresses at will. Whether these companies will truly achieve mass adoption thanks to institutionalization still remains to be seen."
0," USD 5,500 per bitcoin is a good entry point for those willing to buy this most popular cryptocurrency, Jehan Chu, founder of Kenetic Capital, a blockchain investment and advisory firm, said. They have recently revealed that their proprietary investment portfolio has recorded year-to-date returns of 77% against the highly bearish market. Talking on Bloomberg Daybreak Asia, Jehan Chu said, “I bought my first Bitcoin at USD 900 back in late 2013, and I continued buying all the way down to USD 200. Those of us who have been early in the space have seen this before, so do I think that USD 5,500 down from a high from around USD 18,000-19,000 is a good entry point? I do. [...] As we move forward, Bitcoin and some of the larger cap cryptocurrencies will increasingly be seen as a legitimate store of value, especially in the wake of what’s happening across the globe. And I think that USD 5,500 in a year will be seen as a very cheap price.” Forecasts coming from companies that have managed to record high returns might be worth to listen, especially given that the whole market is down around 65% compared to December 2017. (In either case, it's a healthy thing to take all forecasts with a grain of salt. For example, in December 2017, even Jehan Chu estimated that Bitcoin will reach USD 50,000 by the end of 2018 and confirmed this forecast in January.)  The return of 77% is recorded as of October 31st, with two more months until the end of the year. Kenetic Capital CEO Daniel Weinberg explains, “During this volatile period, our proprietary investment portfolio continued to outperform many crypto funds as a result of our deep institutional investment experience and strong risk management.” As to whether Bitcoin can go back to where it was around a year ago, Chu says, “I think we will see a significant turnaround, both in the blockchain space, as well as in the indicative prices of major assets including Bitcoin, Ethereum and other major large-cap cryptocurrencies [...] This past year we saw ICE, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, launch Bakkt in conjunction with Microsoft and Starbucks. So we’re really seeing these blue chip brands entering the space. And I think that’s having a positive overall effect on the enthusiasm and the comfort of the asset.” His opinion on entry points for Bitcoin is shared with some others, notably Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, an insurance giant. Around two months ago, El-Erian said that bitcoin is best bought at USD 5,000 - a reiteration of his previous stance from June. However, El-Erian “doesn't expect it will get all the way back to USD 20,000.” However, some market analysts still do not rule out that the market might continue falling. For example, the well-known quantitative cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo, tweeted this week: This last reading of our blockchain and macro market indicators is still in play... https://t.co/PhWSk6aJu3"
0," Yesterday, we saw a nasty decline in bitcoin price below the USD 6,000 support. BTC/USD failed to hold the USD 5,600 support and extended declines. The price tested the USD 5,400 level and later staged a decent recovery. Similarly, ethereum price recovered above the USD 175 level, but it is struggling to surpass the USD 185 and USD 190 resistance levels. Ripple price performed well as it recovered above USD 0.460, but it is facing a solid resistance near USD 0.475 and USD 0.480. Bitcoin cash hard forked recently into BCHABC and BCHSV. On Binance, Bitcoin Cash ABC traded towards USD 350 and it is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) trading near USD 300. Bitcoin Cash SV traded as high as USD 150 and it is currently trading near USD 130. Total market capitalization  After a short term correction, bitcoin price  traded below the USD 5,600 swing low. BTC/USD declined around USD 200 and tested the USD 5,400 support area where buyers emerged. The price recovered and traded above the USD 5,550 and USD 5,600 levels.
However, sellers defended the USD 5,750 resistance, which is a significant pivot region. To rebound further, the price must break the USD 5,750 and USD 5,800 resistance levels. If not, the price may perhaps decline back towards the USD 5,400 level. Ethereum price  traded below the USD 175 support recently and tested the USD 170 level. Later, ETH/USD recovered above USD 170 and USD 175, but the price faced a strong resistance near USD 185.
The price is currently down around 1.5% to USD 180 and it seems like it could revisit the USD 175 level. If sellers remain in action, the price is likely to surpass the USD 170 support in the near term. Bitcoin cash  ABC clearly dominated as its price traded as high as USD 350. BCHABC/USD is currently trading near USD 300 and it seems like it could move higher towards USD 320 and USD 330 in the near term. On the other hand, BCHSV/USD is trading near the USD 130 level, with an immediate support at USD 120 and resistance at USD 150.
Ripple price  moved with a bullish angle recently and recovered above the USD 0.450 and USD 0.460 resistance levels. However, XRP/USD must surpass the USD 0.480 resistance to climb higher in the near term. A few small cap altcoins recovered between 5%-7% recently, including MONA, WAX, DOGE, BAT, GXS, ZRX, MCO, DGB, ZEN and XLM.
Overall, the recent recovery in bitcoin above USD 5,600 is facing many hurdles near USD 5,750 and USD 5,800. Therefore, there is a risk of more declines towards USD 5,400 or USD 5,200 in the coming sessions. Similarly, ethereum could decline below USD 170 if buyers fail to take control above USD 185 in the short term.

0," If past events are a guide, bitcoin (BTC) could in for a recovery rally in the short-term. Following Wednesday’s 10 percent slump, the leading cryptocurrency printed an intraday low of $5,188 on Thursday, before closing largely unchanged on the day (as per UTC) at $5,580. The price swing formed what’s termed a “long-tailed doji” candle on the daily chart, which is usually taken to represent indecision in the marketplace. The fact that the candle appeared at the bottom of the recent sell-off indicates the indecision is predominantly among the sellers and could be considered a sign of bearish exhaustion. Potentially more interesting, though, is that throughout 2018, BTC has witnessed corrective rallies in the days following the creation of long-tailed candles. As can be seen above, the cryptocurrency created a long-tailed candle on Feb. 6 and rallied to highs above $11,700 in the next two weeks. On similar lines, a long-tailed candle on April 5 was followed by a rally to highs above $9,900 soon after – a pattern that was repeated in June and August (marked by arrows). It’s worth noting that the relative strength index (RSI) was reporting oversold conditions on each occasion. Further, the low of the long-tailed candles has never been put to test on the following day. However, the resultant corrective rallies each ended up creating a lower price high.  The above chart shows: So, the stage may be set for a recovery rally to former support-turned-resistance of $5,777 (June low). A break higher would allow a test of $6,000 – a level at which BTC had supposedly carved out a long-term bottom in recent months. However, the historical pattern may not play out if prices find acceptance below the previous day’s low of $5,188. A break below that level would signal a resumption of the sell-off.

0," Yesterday, we discussed how bitcoin price struggled to hold the lower end of the range support near USD 6,300. BTC/USD declined sharply below the range support and traded below many crucial support such as USD 6,000, USD 5,800 and USD 5,600. Similarly, almost all major altcoins declined heavily, including ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin, EOS, NEO and ADA. The current (UTC 08:30 AM) technical structure suggests that bitcoin moved into a medium term downtrend below USD 6,000 and the current year decline could extend further if buyers fail to protect losses below USD 5,500 and USD 5,000. Read more about the recent market crash here. Total market capitalization  There was a sharp downside reaction after bitcoin price  broke the USD 6,000 support. BTC/USD declined more than 10% and traded at a new 2018 low around USD 5,600. Later, the price started a short term recovery, but buyers are likely to struggle near the USD 5,750 and USD 5,800 resistance levels. 
More importantly, the previous major support at USD 6,000 will most likely act as a strong hurdle for buyers in the near term. Therefore, an upside correction is likely to be limited unless buyers push the price back above USD 6,000. Ethereum price  traded below the USD 200 support and declined around 12%. ETH/USD traded close to the USD 170 level and it is currently consolidating losses.
An initial resistance on the upside is at USD 180, above which the price may perhaps test the USD 190 zone. The main resistance is near USD 195 - USD 200, which was a support earlier. On the downside, a break below USD 170 might push the price towards USD 155. Bitcoin cash price  tumbled more than 15% from the USD 500 swing high and traded close to the USD 400 support area. BCH/USD is currently consolidating near USD 420 with a bearish angle. On the upside, the price is likely to face a strong selling interest near the USD 440 - USD 450 zone. The main support is at USD 400, below which the price may possibly accelerate towards USD 360.
Ripple price  fell sharply below the USD 0.500 support and traded close to the USD 0.420 support. XRP/USD recovered later and it is currently facing resistance near the USD 0.460 and USD 0.470 levels. Many small cap altcoins tumbled by around 15% recently, including RVN, IOST, HC, ARK, STRAT, AION, CMT, WTC, LRC, ELF, NEXO, MKR, PPT, ZIL, ETN and LISK. To sum up, the recent collapse in bitcoin price below USD 6,000 might indicate that this year’s decline is not over yet. BTC/USD and major altcoins may perhaps continue to bleed and there could be more losses. The main support for bitcoin buyers for the current wave is USD 5,000, below which the price might decline towards the USD 4,200 support in the medium term.

0," After a strong sell-off the crypto market just touched new lows. On Thursday morning (UTC 05:50 AM), out of top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization only three are in green. Two of them - stablecoins. What is going on? What possible reasons for the sell-off are and what the market might expect? Let's dive in.  The price of bitcoin fell sharply Wednesday night and early Thursday morning, breaking the pattern of extremely low volatility seen over the past weeks and months. The technical support area formed by bitcoin’s previous low from late June was not enough to keep bitcoin prices from falling, and the sell-off did not stop until price reached USD 5,281 on Coinbase. The sell-off in bitcoin over the past 24 hours adds up to 11.2% on average across exchanges, data from CoinMarketCap shows. Data from the same source also reveals that bitcoin’s market capitalization has now fallen below USD 100 billion for the first time since October 2017, while the value of the entire cryptocurrency market has fallen from nearly 210 billion 24 hours ago to 184.2 billion as of press time. Top 10 coins by market capitalization in the past 24 hours: It’s still early to tell for sure what the reasons behind the most recent sell-off are, but some speculate that volatility in the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) market caused by the controversial BCH hard fork may have affected the BTC market as well. Interestingly, the overnight crypto sell-off also brought Ethereum and Ripple's XRP closer to each other in their battle for the number two spot on the ranking of the most valuable digital assets. Following a 14% sell-off in the price of ether, XRP has now overtaken Ethereum’s traditional position as the second most valuable cryptocurrency by a margin of about USD 100 million. Among other major movers Thursday morning, BCH again stood out with a loss of 18% over the past 24 hours. The sell-off follows heightened tensions ahead of the upcoming BCH hard fork, where Bitcoin SV has really caught up with the more mainstream fork proposal Bitcoin ABC in pre-fork trading on the Poloniex exchange. Best performers among top 100 coins: ____ Worst performers among top 100 coins: _____ Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro, a social trading platform:
“Three main factors are contributing to today’s drop in Bitcoin price.  Marshall Hayner, Founder of Metal Pay, a blockchain-based payments and rewards company: 
“To put it plainly, today’s dip is likely indicative of the fact that the most recent round of crypto speculators are capitulating. Thanks to revised short-term expectations that call into question the idea of a bull run by the end of the year, many are likely taking their chips off the table. A key takeaway from this most recent decline is the continued need for crypto liquidity, which will likely be found in future stages of industry maturation, hopefully in the form of adoption by retail consumers in their day-to-day activities.” Donald Bullers, North American Representative for Elastos, a developer of an internet operating system:
“It’s safe to say that Bitcoin Cash’s upcoming hard fork was stirring uncertainty amongst crypto investors, and forecasters across crypto and traditional markets alike have predicted a prolonged bear market heading into 2019. Crypto investors have proven to be highly reactive to changes across the landscape, and this dip could be the most recent case study of that phenomenon.” Casey Kuhlman, CEO of Monax Industries, a blockchain and smart contract software technology company:
""Crypto price slumps can often create misconceptions about the future of our industry, but perhaps what is most important to remember during periods of volatility is that the underlying blockchain technology solves real-world problems across the real economy. Crypto prices may rise and fall for reasons that are difficult to identify, however, the blockchain industry will remain strong and continue to grow."" Rohit Kulkarni, Managing Director of Private Investment Research at SharesPost, an online platform that links investors with late-stage venture-backed companies and shareholders: 
“We believe that there are three likely catalysts that could result in a crypto market turnaround in the next six months: There is greater clarity from regulators which could embolden the market; A select group of blockchain startups that have completed token offerings in the past year finally announce innovative commercial products; As smart money and institutional capital keeps piling up, investors pull the trigger and call the bottom of the market.” Meanwhile, Meltem Demirors, Chief Strategy Officer at CoinShares, a crypto focused investment company, sees brighter future for Bitcoin, but suggests that smaller cryptocurrencies might be in trouble. _____"
0," Bitcoin is looking oversold after a drop to 13-month lows Wednesday and could defend immediate support at $5,000 in the next few days. The world’s top cryptocurrency by market value fell to $5,324 (price via Bitstamp) in a matter of hours yesterday, reaching its lowest level since Oct. 18. The average price across major exchanges, as calculated by CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index fell 10 percent – the biggest single-day drop since March 30. While BTC had supposedly carved out a long-term bottom around $6,000, the convincing break below that level indicates a resumption of the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached last December. As a result, a deeper drop looks likely, albeit after a minor bout of range-bound trading, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is signaling bearish exhaustion. Notably, the widely followed technical indicator is currently seen at 18, its lowest since September 2014. As the area below 30.00 represents oversold conditions, the bears may now take a breather before hitting the market with fresh offers. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $5,400 on Bitstamp, having clocked a high of $5,641 earlier today.  BTC closed at $5,595 yesterday, confirming a downside break of a nine-month-long descending triangle. Meanwhile, the 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) have adopted a bearish bias, while the stacking order of the 50-day EMA, below the 100-day EMA, below the 200-day EMA, indicates that the path of least resistance is to the downside.  Over on the monthly chart, BTC is trading below the support of the trendline connecting the November 2011 and August 2016 lows, validating the bearish view put forward by the bearish crossover between the 5- and 10-month EMAs in September. The RSI is now threatening to turn bearish below 50.00 for the first time since September 2015. To sum up, the odds are stacked in favor of a drop below the psychological support of $5,000, although the oversold daily RSI indicates that may not happen immediately.

0," Today is a bleak day for cryptocurrencies everywhere as Bitcoin hits the lowest level of the year thus far. Where Bitcoin goes, the rest of the market tends to follow, and indeed, the index shows us all the top-ten coins are experiencing double-digit losses. Currently, Bitcoin is down over 10% and has touched a low of $5,550 a coin. This price is the weakest the coin has been since October 2017 and also puts an end to what was the steadiest period the coin experienced in months. Bitcoin has been trading comfortably around the $6,400 range for the majority of Autumn and volatility was at an all-time low. The market is placing the blame on tomorrow’s Bitcoin Cash hard fork for the selloff across the exchanges today. As stated, the damage is widespread, and Bitcoin Cash itself is suffering the hardest, with losses just shy of 17%. Ethereum is down -13.5% and Litecoin is down -13.05%, but the entire top-ten are hurting. The Bitcoin Cash hard fork will result in a network being split into two different versions of Bitcoin Cash. One upgrade will follow the Roger Ver-favored Bitcoin Cash ABC protocol, and the other will follow Craig Wright’s preferred protocol, the Bitcoin Cash SV. According to Mati Greenspan of eToro: “Both Roger and Craig are advocating a different version of Bitcoin Cash […] The end result will most likely be a split in the network resulting in two different versions of Bitcoin Cash when both upgrades go into effect this Thursday.” >> Japenese Crypto Exchange Coincheck Resumes NEM (XEM) Trade Ten Months Later The entire cryptocurrency market capitalization dropped by $15 billion USD over 24 hours Wednesday. And the total market cap of $85 billion is down more than 70% since the start of this year. This is a far cry from the highs of 2017 when Bitcoin was selling for $19,511 a coin. What do you think about Bitcoin’s new low? Featured Image: Depositphotos/© ilixe48"
0," There was no recovery in bitcoin price above the USD 6,450 and USD 6,500 resistance levels. BTC/USD extended losses and traded below the USD 6,400 support area. It seems like the price is closing in towards the lower end of the range support at USD 6,300 and USD 6,250 where buyers are likely to struggle. Similarly, ethereum price declined below the USD 208 support, opening the doors for a test of the USD 200 support area. Ripple price also started a downside correction below USD 0.520 and trimmed most its recent gains. Total market capitalization  There was yet another failure near the USD 6,450 resistance in bitcoin price . BTC/USD moved down and traded below the USD 6,400 support area. It seems like sellers are in control and they could even push the price towards the key support at USD 6,300. Further below, the USD 6,250 support is the last line of defense for buyers and represents the lower end of the range support.
If there is an upside correction, the price may struggle to clear the USD 6,420 and USD 6,450 resistance levels. The main resistance on the upside is near the USD 6,500 level. Ethereum price  broke the key support at USD 208 and declined further. ETH/USD is likely to extend declines towards the USD 200 - USD 202 support area where buyers are likely to emerge.
On the flip side, if there is an upside correction, the USD 210 level could prevent gains. The next key resistance for a larger upward move awaits near USD 215, above which the price could test USD 225. Bitcoin cash price  started consolidation above the USD 500 support area. BCH/USD could correct higher, but it is likely to face sellers near the USD 530 and USD 540 levels. Above both levels, the price may perhaps surpass the USD 550 level. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 505, below which the price possibly will break the USD 500 support.
Ripple price  started a downside correction and traded below the USD 0.520 and USD 0.515 levels. XRP/USD is about to reach the USD 0.505 support where it could find a strong buying interest. Many small cap altcoins declined more than 5% recently, including WAX, XEM, XIN, ARK, MITH, ZRX, BAT and HC. On the other hand, two altcoins, SRN and ETA gained 17% and 11% respectively. Overall, bitcoin price is at a risk of more losses below the USD 6,300 support if buyers fail to contain selling pressure. The main supports are USD 6,300 and USD 6,250, below which there could be heavy slides in the coming days. Similarly, ethereum is reaching the lower end of the range support near USD 202, below which the price may well extend its declines towards USD 180.

0," After US retail giant Target had been hit by a bitcoin giveaway scam on Tuesday, on the same day Google fell victim to the same type of attack. However, this time the scammers left empty-handed.  According to a screenshot, shared by the the Twitter user @B_u_r_t_o_n  “Google” had seemingly decided to do “the biggest crypto-giveaway in the world.” The only thing users would have to do to participate in the “giveaway” was to “verify” their address by sending between 0.1 and 2 BTC – worth between 630 and 12,500 USD – to a bitcoin address, and then wait to receive between 1 and 20 BTC back.  The only problem, however, is that naïve users will never get any bitcoin back, and the hackers will instead run away with all the bitcoin they receive. In this case, the fake tweet, which came from G Suite’s (Google's brand of cloud computing, productivity and collaboration tools) verified Twitter account, was deleted after about 15 minutes. Google confirmed the breach. “We removed the tweet and are investigating with Twitter now,” a spokesperson for Google told Business Insider. However, it seems that the attack was a total failure. A search of the scammer’s Bitcoin address reveals that the corresponding wallet did not receive any bitcoins.  In comparison, in case of Target, scammers received a total of 5.86342085 BTC – about USD 36,887 – from unsuspecting victims.  So-called crypto giveaway scams have become a big problem on Twitter, and the social networking giant appears unable to stop the practice from spreading. A popular strategy among scammer is to set up accounts that impersonate famous people, and then launch a giveaway from that account. Tesla founder Elon Musk has for a long time been a favorite target for Twitter impersonators who typically creates accounts with usernames similar to the real Elon Musk.  Recently, however, more scams have occurred by hackers taking over control of verified Twitter accounts from well-known people (including Pope Francis and the US president Donald Trump) and companies to make the scam more believable, and then use those to ask for bitcoin payments. According to Twitter spokesperson, ""scammers are constantly changing their methods and it’s our job to stay on top of their movements, observe their actions and work to stay one step ahead. In most cases, our enforcement teams are detecting fraudulent activity and taking it down before it’s reported."""
0," Bitcoin sank to its lowest price in over a year on Wednesday, with the prices of other major cryptocurrencies falling alongside it. As of press time, bitcoin is trading at $5,525.92 – a more than 12 percent decline on the day – in the latest sign that volatility around the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has returned with a vengeance. Indeed, bitcoin’s collective market cap dropped below the $100 billion level for the first time since November 12 of last year, according to CoinDesk’s Crypto-Economics Explorer (CEX). In the past 12-hours alone, the total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market fell from roughly $210 billion to where it stands now, $180 billion. Today’s 15 percent depreciation has led the market to its lowest value since Oct. 31 of last year, CoinMarketCap data reveals. Other major cryptocurrencies are reporting declines in excess of 10 percent on the day, including ETH, XRP and bitcoin cash – the latter of which is gearing up for a contentious hard fork on Nov. 15. Notably, market data indicates that in light of today’s market drop, XRP (as of the time of this writing) has the second-largest market capitalization for cryptocurrencies, surpassing ETH. USDT, the stablecoin known more commonly as tether, saw a notable drop in its price to a low of $0.95 on crypto exchange Kraken, which offers one of the few trading pairs of the token against the U.S. dollar. Tether, among other stablecoins, is intended to hold parity against the U.S. dollar, and data from CoinMarketCap shows that the token is trading in the $0.96-$0.97 range. Because of the dip in USDT, the BTC premium on exchanges like Bitfinex, which trades against USDT, has risen to over $300. In other words, a single unit of bitcoin can now be purchased for $5,557 on Coinbase (a regulated exchange trading against USD) while the same unit costs $5,870 USDT on Bitfinex.

0," Bitcoin’s (BTC) price woes may not be over just yet, as a key technical indicator is about to turn bearish for the first time in four years. On the three-day chart, the 50-candle simple moving average (SMA) looks set to cut the 200-candle SMA from above, confirming what is popularly known as the “death cross.” This specific bearish crossover was last seen in December 2014. The onset of a death cross can be a warning that a bear market is looming, according to technical theory. In reality, however, it is the result of a prolonged bear market – i.e., it’s a backward-looking indicator. As a result, the oversold market usually sees a bounce after a bearish crossover is confirmed. In this case, the crossover looks likely to occur in the next few days. The bulls, however, are cautioned against betting on a follow-up price jump immediately, as prices dropped 50 percent in the four weeks following the death cross confirmation in mid-December 2014. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,185 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.8 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  On the three-day chart, the impending death cross can be seen as the confluence of the 50-candle and 200-candle simple moving average (SMA), which have closed sharply in the last three months. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) of 41.00 is biased toward the bears and holding well above the oversold territory (below 30.00). Therefore, prices could be in for a deeper drop in the short-term, possibly to levels below the June low of $5,774. It’s worth noting that the sell-off witnessed after the death cross seen in December 2014 ended up carving a long-term bottom at $152 in January 2015. On similar lines, the impending crossover and the resulting slide in prices, if any, could turn out to be the final leg of the bear market. As for today, the cryptocurrency is looking weak, having found acceptance below the trendline connecting the Oct. 11 and Oct. 31 lows.  Over on the daily chart, the violation of the ascending trendline support is backed by the downward sloping 5- and 10-day SMAs. This backs up the view that deeper losses toward $6,000 could be in the offing in the next 24 hours. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

0," During the past three sessions, there was no noticeable recovery in bitcoin above the USD 6,500 resistance. BTC/USD declined below the USD 6,450 support and it is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) trading with a bearish angle. Similarly, ethereum faced a lot of offers near the USD 215 resistance, resulting in a downside reaction. On the other hand, ripple recovered recently and moved above the USD 0.515 and 0.520 resistance levels. Going forward, bitcoin must move above the USD 6,500 resistance. If not, there is a risk of a sharp bearish reaction towards USD 6,200 in the near term. Total market capitalization  There was an increase in selling pressure on bitcoin price  and it failed to surpass the USD 6,500 resistance. BTC/USD traded close to the USD 6,400 support and it is currently consolidating losses. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 6,475, above which buyers are likely to struggle near USD 6,500.
On the flip side, if sellers gain pace below the USD 6,400 support, the price could move down sharply towards the USD 6,250 and USD 6,200 support levels in the short term. Ethereum price  made an attempt to surpass the USD 215 resistance, but it failed. ETH/USD is currently trading near the USD 208 support with range moves.
If there is a downside break below USD 208 or USD 206, the price will most likely trade below the USD 200 support. To rebound, buyers need to push the price above the USD 215 and USD 218 resistance levels. Bitcoin cash price  tested the USD 500 support recently and later recovered a few points. However, BCH/USD is still down around 2% and it remains at a risk of more losses if there is a close below the USD 500 support. On the upside, a break above the USD 525 and USD 530 levels is required for a decent recovery.
Ripple price  outperformed other major cryptocurrencies and recovered around 4%. XRP/USD moved above the USD 0.520 resistance and it may continue to rise in the near term towards USD 0.535 or USD 0.540. Despite bearish moves in bitcoin and ethereum, a few small altcoins managed to climb higher by more than 10%, including XEM, LINK, XET and ETA. Out of these, XEM gained around 12% and LINK rallied nearly 13%. To sum up, the recent moves suggest weakness in bitcoin price below the USD 6,500 resistance. If BTC/USD continues to fail near USD 6,475 and USD 6,500, there could be a downward move. Having said that, there are many key supports near USD 6,400 and USD 6,300. Therefore, it won’t be easy for sellers to gain momentum below USD 6,400.

0," Bitcoin’s (BTC) price dropped to two-week lows earlier today and could extend the decline to key support near $6,100, technical charts indicate. The leading cryptocurrency was teasing a bullish move 24-hours ago, having carved out a lower high of $6,270 along the support of the trendline connecting the Oct. 11 low and Oct. 31 low. The defense of the key trendline support was also backed by a bullish divergence of the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) histogram. Even so, BTC failed to pick up a bid, possibly due to sharp losses in US equities, and fell back to $6,252 in the Asian session today – the lowest level since Oct 31. BTC was last seen changing hands at $6,285 on Coinbase, representing a 0.80 percent drop on the day.  BTC has breached the ascending trendline support on the 4-hour chart, adding credence to the lower highs and lower lows pattern created from the Nov. 7 high of $6,540. The relative strength index of 32 is also biased toward the bears. So, a deeper drop could be in the offing. The bearish setup, however, would be invalidated if prices cut through the descending trendline, representing lower highs pattern.  Over on the 3-day chart, BTC looks set to test support at the trendline connecting the June 24 and Aug. 14 lows, currently at $6,113, having charted a “gravestone doj” (bearish reversal pattern) earlier this month. The bearish candlestick also marks the bulls’ failure to capitalize on the sideways breach of the triangle pattern, witnessed at the end of October.

0," This past week, bitcoin price jumped above the USD 6,500 and USD 6,550 resistance levels. However, BTC/USD failed to stay above the USD 6,600 resistance and later started a major downward move. The price trimmed most gains and settled below the USD 6,500 support level. Similarly, ethereum price declined from well above USD 220 and it is currently above the USD 208 support level. More importantly, ripple price declined sharply and tested the USD 0.500 support. At the outset, it seems like bitcoin and major altcoins are under pressure and remain at a risk of a downside break. Total market capitalization  Recently, bitcoin price  moved below the USD 6,500 and USD 6,450 support levels. BTC/USD tested the USD 6,400 support and later recovered a few points. The price is currently consolidating around USD 6,450, with an immediate resistance at USD 6,500. 
The main weekly resistance is at USD 6,600, above which the price may move towards the USD 6,750 level. On the other hand, if buyers fail to push the price above USD 6,500 and USD 6,550, there could be more downsides. The key weekly support is at USD 6,400, below which the price will most likely slide towards the USD 6,200 support. Ethereum price  also trimmed most gains and declined below the USD 215 support. ETH/USD tested the USD 208 support level and it is currently consolidating losses.
On the upside, the price must move past USD 215 and USD 220 to start a new upward move. If not, there is a risk of a bearish break below the USD 208 and USD 206 supports. The main weekly support is at USD 200, below which the price could drop to USD 185. Bitcoin cash price  is down more than USD 100 from the last week’s high and it is currently trading just above the USD 500 support. If BCH/USD declined below the USD 500 support, sellers could take control and push the price towards the USD 450 support area. On the upside, resistances are seen near USD 540, USD 550 and USD 575.
Ripple price  traded below the USD 0.525 and 0.515 support levels to move into a bearish zone. However, XRP/USD is still above the USD 0.500 support and there are slight chances of a decent recovery in the near term. Many altcoins declined recently and registered losses more than 5% today, including XET, VERI, SC, BAT, RVN, IOST, revain, DOGE and ZEC. Out of these, XET is down around 11% and VERI fell roughly 8%. Overall, bitcoin price seems to be struggling to recover above USD 6,500. If BTC/USD continues to face selling pressure, there is a risk of a bearish break below the USD 6,420 and USD 6,400 support levels. Similarly, ethereum and ripple must recover above key resistances (USD 220 and USD 0.525 respectively) to avoid a sharp decline.

0," Bitcoin could be in for a recovery rally, having defended a key support level over the weekend. The leading cryptocurrency has been looking bearish over the last week. It suffered an ascending channel breakdown on Nov. 7, suggesting a temporary top had been created at $6,540, while the moving averages rolled over in favor of the bears a day later. As a result, BTC looked likely to drop below the support of the trendline connecting the Oct. 11 and Oct. 31 lows, and move toward $6,200 over the weekend. Instead, though, it carved out a higher low (bullish pattern) at $6,270 yesterday. More importantly, the bears failed to secure a sustained break below that rising trendline. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,360 on Coinbase, while the ascending trendline support is located at $6,300. While the rebound from the ascending trendline is encouraging, a bullish reversal would only be confirmed if prices move above $6,540 to set a higher high.  As can be seen above, BTC charted a second higher low along the rising trendline yesterday, saving the day for the bulls. BTC is also currently creating the right shoulder of an inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern. A break above the neckline resistance of $6,390, if confirmed, would pave way for a move to $6,510 (target as per the measured height method). The major exponential moving averages (EMAs) – 50, 100 and 200 – have shed bearish bias (are flatlined) too. So, a bull breakout could happen in the next few hours as the prices have bounced nicely off the trendline support.  Over on the 4-hour chart, the bullish divergence of the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) histogram is indicating that the sell-off from the last week’s high of $6,540 has likely run its course and a recovery could soon unfold. A bullish divergence is confirmed when an asset records a lower price low and the MACD records a higher low. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

0," After trading above the USD 6,660 level, bitcoin price started a downside correction. BTC/USD declined below USD 6,550 and recently tested a major support near USD 6,500, which protected further losses. Similarly, ethereum tested the USD 215 support and it is currently consolidating in a tight range. On the other hand, bitcoin cash and ripple declined a few more points and later managed to recover. The current market sentiment is neutral and it seems like there could be range moves in bitcoin and ethereum before the next move.  Total market capitalization  There was an extended downside correction below the USD 6,550 support in bitcoin price . BTC/USD declined and traded below the USD 6,525 level. The price tested the next major support at USD 6,500, which acted as a solid barrier for sellers.
At the moment, the price is slowly recovering, but the previous supports at USD 6,520 and USD 6,530 may perhaps act as resistances. The main resistance could be USD 6,550, above which the price will most likely revisit the USD 6,660 resistance. Ethereum price  traded below the USD 215 support recently, but later it managed to recover. ETH/USD is currently consolidating near USD 215 and it is preparing for the next move.
Buyers need to gain strength above the USD 220 and USD 225 levels to accelerate upsides. On the other hand, a break below the USD 215 support may push the price back towards the USD 210 support. Bitcoin cash price  extended slides and traded below the USD 630 and USD 600 support levels. BCH/USD traded close to the USD 570 support and later recovered. It is currently trading near USD 600, with an immediate resistance at USD 620 followed by USD 630. On the downside, the USD 580 and USD 570 levels are important supports.
Ripple price  declined sharply and even spiked below the USD 0.500 support as discussed yesterday. XRP/USD tested the USD 0.495 level and bounced back. It is currently recovering, but it may face a strong resistance near USD 0.520. During the past few hours, a few altcoins gained traction, including XET, WAX and MANA. XET (Eternal Token) is up more than 25% and WAX extended gains and traded up around 18%. Overall, bitcoin price extended its downside correction and it is not at a risk of a downside break below USD 6,480 - USD 6,500. Should BTC/USD fail to bounce back above USD 6,550, sellers are likely to gain strength. A daily close below USD 6,480 or USD 6,450 may accelerate declines in bitcoin in the coming days. Similarly, ethereum must stay above the USD 208 support and ripple price should break the USD 0.520 - USD 0.525 resistance zone to move back in a positive zone.

0," Bitcoin’s (BTC) reversal of the recent uptrend in prices is gathering pace and a drop into a bearish territory below $6,200 is now a possibility, technical charts indicate. The leading cryptocurrency found acceptance below the lower edge of the rising channel yesterday, invalidating the bullish price action witnessed earlier this week. Essentially, the rally from the Oct. 31 low of $6,201 has ended at a high of $6,540 reached on Nov. 7. At press time, BTC is trading at $6,350 on Coinbase, having clocked a five-day low of $6,335 soon before press time, following a sudden $100 drop. The negative follow through to yesterday’s bullish channel breakdown is an indication that the bears are likely feeling emboldened, having pulled down prices by 2.9 percent from weekly highs. As a result, the support of the trendline from Oct. 11 lows could be breached in the next few hours, opening the doors for a drop below the recent higher low of $6,200 (Oct. 31).  As can be seen above, the cryptocurrency has established a bearish lower highs and lower lows pattern, validating yesterday’s bullish channel breakdown. Further, prices seem to have found acceptance under the crucial 200-hour exponential moving average (EMA) support and the major EMAS – 50, 100 and 200 – are beginning to roll over in favor of the bears. In particular, the 50-hour looks set to cross the 100-hour EMA from above, bolstering the already bearish technical setup. The drop below the immediate support of $6,330 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement), however, is likely to happen after a minor bout of consolidation, as the relative strength index (RSI) is reporting oversold conditions below 30.00.  Over on the daily chart, the symmetrical triangle breakout and a close above the critical 50-day EMA resistance witnessed earlier this week failed to produce significant price gains. A failed breakout often ends up putting the bears back into the driver’s seat. Hence, a slide to $6,200 could be in the offing.

0," US financial service company Square (NYSE:SQ) just announced that its Q3 Bitcoin (BTC) revenue jumped up from its previous earnings in Q2. Square detailed its full company earnings in a shareholder letter released yesterday. In the third quarter of 2018, we continued to drive strong growth at scale. $SQ https://t.co/HPhSMfVgac — Square IR (@SquareIR) November 7, 2018  Square released a full digest of its total earning and financial activities. The release was far more colorful and interactive than most public companies’ earnings reports. It included various pie charts, graphs, and diagrams, uncommon in the earnings space. Earlier this year, the newly public company introduced Bitcoin support in its Square Cash payment app. Compared to Q2, cryptocurrency revenue grew $6 million in Q3. “Total net revenue was $882 million in the third quarter of 2018, up 51% year over year. This includes $43 million of bitcoin revenue,” the report reads. Square has been on the rise lately, as its market cap just passed Twitter’s this week. Coincidentally, Jack Dorsey is CEO of both companies. While media interest may be down in cryptocurrency this year, this earnings report shows that there is still interest in the crypto space. >> A Guide to Understanding Cryptocurrency White Papers Bitcoin profits remain a niche for Square, and the company only brought in profits of around $500,000 after taking into account Bitcoin purchasing costs. This past October, Square expanded its interaction by open sourcing its cold storage set up and expanding its crypto offerings in new jurisdictions. Square just recently launched Square Terminal, which allows merchants to take debit and credit card payments. There have been rumors circulating about the possible merchants’ integration with BTC, but there have yet to be any official reports on the matter. At press time, Bitcoin is currently trading at $6,515.40 a coin, down -0.11%. This week, the original digital currency went on a bit of a bull run and jumped above the $6,500 mark, but now it seems to have slightly corrected. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© peshkova"
0," Recently, there were positive moves in bitcoin above the USD 6,550 level. BTC/USD even traded above the USD 6,600 level and later started a downside correction. The price is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) consolidating gains above the USD 6,550 support and dips remain supported. Similarly, ethereum retreated from the USD 225 resistance and it is currently trading near the USD 215 support. Besides, ripple and bitcoin cash have corrected lower and both are approaching important support levels. Total market capitalization  A fresh correction wave was initiated from well above the USD 6,600 level in bitcoin price . BTC/USD traded below the USD 6,575 level and tested the USD 6,550 support (the previous resistance). The price is currently consolidating and it seems like there could be a renewed upside above USD 6,580 in the near term.
On the flip side, if there is an extended downside correction, the price may perhaps test the next major support at USD 6,500. The overall price action is positive as long as bitcoin is above USD 6,550 and USD 6,500. Ethereum price  also corrected lower recently and traded below the USD 220 level. ETH/USD tested the USD 215 level and it is currently consolidating. If it stays above USD 215, there might be an upward move above the USD 220 level.
If not, the price could slide further towards the USD 208 support, which was a significant barrier for buyers previously and now it is likely to hold losses. Bitcoin cash price  started a sharp downside correction below the USD 600 level. BCH/USD is down more than 4% and it is currently heading towards the USD 570 support. If there are further losses, the price may well test the USD 550 support. On the upside, an initial resistance is near USD 600, above which the price may retest USD 630.
Ripple price  is slightly under pressure as it failed to stay above the USD 0.530 and USD 0.525 support levels. The next major support awaits near USD 0.500 where XRP/USD will most likely find a strong buying interest. On the upside, the previous supports at USD 0.525 and USD 0.530 might act as resistances. Despite the recent correction in bitcoin, a few small cap altcoins traded higher between 5%-8%, including POLY, WAX, BAT and NPXS. Out of these, POLY is up around 8% and WAX gained roughly 7%. To sum up, it seems like bitcoin is correcting recent gains, but there are many supports on the downside between USD 6,560 and USD 6,500. If there is a downside break below USD 6,500, there are chances of a sharp decline in BTC/USD. Similarly, ethereum must stay above the USD 208 and USD 202 support levels. If not, there is a risk of a fresh bearish wave below USD 200.

0," Bitcoin is painting a less bullish picture than 24 hours ago, following a drop out of an ascending price channel. Stepping back, the leading cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid at $6,200 on Oct. 31, keeping the crucial 21-month EMA support intact. Further, it witnessed a symmetrical triangle breakout earlier this week, suggesting that bulls had come out victorious in a tug of war with the bears. The breakout had looked legitimate as the technical indicators turned increasingly bullish. In particular, the relative strength index rose to a three-month high of 59.00 yesterday, signaling strong bullish conditions. As a result, BTC was expected to remain well bid above $6,500 and looked likely to rise to $6,800 in the near-term. Instead, it fell back to $6,450 on Coinbase earlier today, invalidating the bullish higher lows and higher highs pattern, as seen in the chart below.  The rising channel seen in the hourly chart has been breached to the downside, meaning the recovery rally from the Oct. 31 low of $6,201 likely ended at a high of $6,540 reached yesterday. The stacking order of the 50-hour exponential moving average (EMA) above the 100-hour EMA, above the 200-hour EMA indicates the path of least resistance is still on the higher side. That bullish signal could soon weaken, though, as moving averages are lagging indicators. While the channel breakdown has opened the doors for a deeper drop to $6,372 (horizontal support line), a bearish reversal would be confirmed only if BTC drops below 6,200 (Oct. 31 low).  Over on the daily chart, BTC bears may feel emboldened if prices drop below $6,200, negating the higher low pattern. That scenario seems unlikely with bitcoin’s current lack of volatility, however. Investors should keep an eye out for a strong bounce from the ascending (bullish) 10-day EMA, as that could recharge the engines for a rally to $6,800.

1," According to data from the popular crypto exchange Bitfinex, the number of short positions on bitcoin have just hit its lowest level since early August, a clear indication that the sentiment surrounding the number one cryptocurrency is becoming more positive. At the same time, the number of long positions on the exchange has increased, overtaking the number of shorts on November 2. Prior to that, the bears have consistently been in the majority, as seen in the chart below. Bitcoin short orders in red and bitcoin long orders in blue on Bitfinex: Meanwhile, the ratio between short and long positions on bitcoin has dropped to 0.86, which means that there is now a net long-bias among Bitfinex users. That marks a distinct change for the market, which has been overwhelmingly short-biased over the past few months.  A short-to-long ratio of 1 (red line on the chart) indicates neutral market conditions, where neither bears nor bulls are in the majority. Bitcoin short-to-long ratio on Bitfinex: It’s worth noting that distorted market conditions where either the long side or the short side becomes “overcrowded” tends to cause temporary reversals in the market. This is for example what we have seen happening during the multiple “short-squeezes” this year, leading to sharply higher prices. Similarly, an abundance of long trades can cause pullbacks to become sharper and more violent than they would otherwise be. At today’s levels, however, the ratio is still healthy and we are far from extreme levels. Instead, it is likely a reaction to prices gradually moving higher after having been flat for weeks."
1," Yesterday, we discussed chances of more upsides in bitcoin above the USD 6,500 resistance. BTC/USD did trade higher and broke the USD 6,500 and USD 6,550 resistance levels. The price traded to a new monthly high above USD 6,600 before starting a short term correction. Bitcoin cash rallied close to 15%, and surpassed the USD 600 barrier. Similarly, ethereum and ripple also extended gains and both remain well supported for upsides in the coming sessions. Total market capitalization  There was an upward move in bitcoin price  above the USD 6,500 resistance. BTC/USD gained momentum and traded above the USD 6,550 and USD 6,600 resistance levels. The price is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) consolidating with corrective moves near USD 6,580. An initial support is at USD 6,550, below which the USD 6,500 level could act as a strong support.
On the upside, the price is likely to climb above USD 6,600 once again and it seems like buyers might attempt to push the price above USD 6,650 or USD 6,700 in the near term. Ethereum price  continued to trade higher and it recently broke the USD 220 resistance. ETH/USD is showing a lot of positive signs and it seems like the price may accelerate towards the USD 225 and USD 230 levels in the near term.
If there is a downside correction, the USD 215 - USD 216 zone is likely to act as a solid support. Below the stated zone, the next key support is at USD 210, which was a resistance earlier. Bitcoin cash price  started a fresh rally and surged above the USD 575 and USD 600 resistance levels. BCH/USD is up around 15% and it seems like the price is preparing for a test of the USD 650 resistance. The main supports on the downside are aligned near the USD 620 and USD 620 levels.
Ripple price  mostly remained flat and it is slowly correcting lower below USD 0.540. It seems like XRP/USD could extend the current correction and test the USD 0.525 support area where buyers are likely to emerge. Many small cap altcoins gained traction recently and traded up more than 5%, including AOA, QTUM, ZEC, BTM, GXS and ZEN. Out of these QTUM is performing really well as buyers pushed the price above the USD 4.00 resistance. Overall, bitcoin buyers are gaining pace and it seems like the price is likely to climb higher towards USD 6,650 and USD 6,700 levels in the coming sessions. If BTC/USD breaks the USD 6,700 barrier, it could boost the market sentiment and altcoins like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, neo, litecoin, icon, wan and binance coin possibly might gain upside momentum.

1," Bitcoin (BTC) looks likely to inch higher toward $6,800 in the near-term, as the technical indicators have grown increasingly bullish in the last 24 hours. Notably, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which measures the speed and change of price movements, has jumped to 59.04 – the highest level since Sept. 4. A reading above 50 indicates that bullish forces are acting on the asset. So, it seems safe to say that the leading cryptocurrency is looking its most bullish for two months. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,510 on Coinbase, representing a $100 or 1.5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. While the strong RSI is encouraging for the bulls, technical analysts may argue that calling a bullish move on the basis of that alone is somewhat risky, as the indicator occasionally produces fake signals. Even so, in this case, other BTC indicators are also biased toward the bulls, giving the RSI greater reliability.  As can be seen above, BTC has cleared the stiff 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) hurdle today, having witnessed a bullish symmetrical triangle breakout over the weekend. The 5- and 10-day EMAs are trending north, indicating a bullish setup. Further, BTC is trading above the upper Bollinger band of $6,500 at press time, and a breakout would be confirmed if prices see a UTC close today above that level. What’s more, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is rising, indicating scope for further gains. To sum up, both price action and the technical indicators are validating the bullish signals given by the RSI. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

1," The contentious nature of the ecosystem around cryptocurrencies is partly what gives them value – academics call it “belief heterogenity.” But discord and personal sentiment alone isn’t enough to keep prices above zero, according to research from Wang Chun Wei, Ph.D., a finance lecturer at the University of Queensland in Australia. According to Wei, if it was easier to bet against cryptocurrency prices through short positions – when someone borrows, then sells an asset with the expectation of buying it back at a lower price in an effort to make a profit on the difference  –  more of those assets would go to zero. “Daily volatility of bitcoin is around four percent. This is too high to be simply based on informational changes in fundamental value,” Wei, who previously studied whether Tether’s controversial stablecoin, USDT, could be used to prop up the price of bitcoin, told CoinDesk. As such, to investigate a better explanation for this observation, Wei looked at coins that most people would agree should be worth zero: cryptocurrencies believed to be either jokes or scams. His latest investigation into crypto values, first published in October, confirmed a longstanding theory of finance – something called the resale option hypothesis – at least partly explains why cryptocurrencies are valued the way they are today. The resale option hypothesis, which originated in 2003 from Princeton researchers Jose Scheinkman and Wei Xiong, argues that an asset tends to favor the most optimistic participants in a market (those with long bets) when two conditions persist: lots of disagreement about price and impediments to shorting the asset. “Both conditions exist in the crypto market,” Wei said. Without easy ways for people to short then, the market favors the long position. Wei told CoinDesk: “The hope that you can sell it to someone for more than what you paid for is an important factor driving cryptocurrency prices.” While Wei conducted his study on altcoins – particularly those with shady reputations – he reasoned that what he found should also explain some of the strangeness behind bitcoin’s price movements. For much of its history, the exact reasons for bitcoin’s price moves haven’t been readily apparent – these fundamentals mysterious even to the most devout maximalist. Wei studied three baskets of cryptocurrencies: mainstream coins, alleged scams and outright jokes. The mainstream basket included seven cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and XRP. The list of less-than-savory coins included the Ponzi scheme-tied Bitconnect, Urocoin (originally pitched as a coin for farmers) and ParagonCoin (a cannabis industry everything-coin). The joke-coin list featured dogecoin, RonPaulCoin and Useless Ethereum Token (UET) – the latter which wasn’t a true “scam” because its creator was forthright about his intention to take investor funds and run. According to Wei, differences of opinion help illuminate why joke coins tend to hold on to their price a bit longer than cryptocurrencies identified as fraudulent. While fraudulent tokens might hold onto their value even as suspicions mount, that eventually changes as the hustle is definitively revealed. “Once it becomes crystal clear that there’s no fundamental value, then you lose belief dispersion and the resale option value plummets,” Wei wrote in the paper. But if a coin was made in jest – without maliciousness – who’s to say it couldn’t be viewed as valuable regardless? he reasoned. So, how can this price effect be seen for the cryptocurrencies with bigger market capitalizations and wider network effects? Resale option value is, in itself, difficult to pin down. “There’s no precise way of calculating resale option value,” Wei wrote. In his paper, he tested “the statistical significance of the interactions between turnover, traded price and realized volatility” to infer a value. And based on that analysis, the hypothesis does apply to more mainstream coins. “We find mainstream cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, ethereum and [XRP], test positive to the resale option test,” Weid said. “This suggests that the price-volume relationship for mainstream cryptocurrencies exhibit speculative behavior, and thus it is unlikely that traded price for these cryptocurrencies reflect only fundamental value.” Indeed, according to Wei, the market got something of a real-world test of this idea recently as bitcoin futures began to trade on major markets starting at the end of last year. Wei told CoinDesk: “Theoretically, the introduction of shorting instruments should reduce the resale option value, and consequently reduce bitcoin price (the latter which we can see clearly).” Shorting options will soon expand for other cryptocurrencies as well. For example, Dydx is offering tokens for shorting, and crypto startup Compound has created a borrowing market that can be used for shorting coins. If Wei’s analysis proves accurate, that could increase pressure on more of the tokens that have been able to maintain higher prices. As Wei wrote in the paper, “Overall, we provide ample empirical evidence in support of anecdotal claims that cryptocurrency prices are supported by the hope of selling it to somebody else at a higher price.” Charts via Shutterstock"
1," Bitcoin (BTC) futures hit record low volatility in October on the US Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), MarketWatch reported yesterday. Kevin Davitt, a Senior instructor at CBOE Options Institute, published a video on November 1st outlining the volatility decline.  In the video above, Davitt outlines that the average weekly volatility for XBT-CBOE Bitcoin (BTC) futures on the week ending October 26th was just three percent. This is the lowest level of volatility since the futures contracts launched on December 10th, 2017. As of the first of November, the average weekly XBT high-low range on front-month Bitcoin futures since inception is 15.65%. Since tax day, mid-April 2018, this weekly average had dropped to 10.6%. “As it turns out, [Bitcoin] XBT futures and cryptos in general are moving with very little speed. The week ending Oct. 26th was the least volatile since futures were introduced nearly a year ago,” Davitt told MarketWatch. This CBOE Bitcoin (BTC) futures news is a positive one for institutional investors wanting to get into the crypto space, as high volatility is the reason most have stayed away. Even major banks interested in launching their own crypto products have been hesitant due to the volatility and current low-demand for these products. >> Crypto Airdrops are Now Illegal in China Former L/S Equities portfolio manager, Travis Kling, pointed out: Over the last month, BTC and Crypto markets broadly have hung in INCREDIBLY well in the context of traditional asset class stress. Not making a call on whether or not this will continue, just pointing out the recent divergence. pic.twitter.com/gDhYjUORSe — Travis Kling (@Travis_Kling) October 29, 2018  In October, the stock market plummeted to its lowest day-losses in seven years. Coincidentally, the cryptocurrency market remained solid and didn’t drop with it. One would expect if investors on Wall Street are selling, the panic would have spread to crypto investors, but as seen in the chart above, crypto enthusiasts remained cool, calm, and collected. This is a positive sign for the industry, as it shows maturity and stability. While crypto assets still remain a high-risk assessment, institutional investors may now be more inclined to dip their toes in Bitcoin (BTC) as it shows continued stability.

1," American actress Gwyneth Paltrow is the latest in the line of celebrities promoting Bitcoin, tweeting out a Q&A with Bill Barhydt, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Abra, from her site called Goop. Her site has supposedly evolved from a lifestyle newsletter into a “lifestyle brand” in the past 10 years of existence, but this Q&A is the first time cryptocurrencies are mentioned there. The Q&A delves into the basic questions of what Bitcoin is, how you can get some, and what gives it value. Barhydt also answers questions about other cryptocurrencies and blockchain itself for a short, simplistic overview of the topic.  Great piece with @billbarhydt on @goop today https://t.co/cBoeHJ9ts7 On the topic of value, Barhydt explains, “Ultimately, anything has value because people agree that it has value. Government-issued money, such as the US dollar, has value because we all agree that it does, mostly because our government accepts payments of tax debts only in its own money.” He also explains the unique points of Bitcoin versus fiat currencies, such as mining, the network effect and scarcity. He adds, “Lastly, we believe Bitcoin technology will be used to enable people in developing markets to lease home electronics such as washing machines, refrigerators, televisions, etc. The buyer will simply forward a small amount of Bitcoin every week to the wallet of the seller and this will enable the appliance to function. This is not easily possible with traditional government money, and it is a powerful possibility.” Featuring a Bitcoin Q&A on Paltrow’s site has the community divided. “...and people are calling this a bear market,” tweeted Jackson Palmer, creator of Dogecoin, in reply to Paltrow’s tweet. However, user @shillycrypto replies to him, “I genuinely hate Goop so I guess I have to sell everything now.” Goop is widely controversial and often considered a peddler of pseudoscience. From using stickers “made of spacesuits” to “rebalance energy” (which NASA debunked), over doing colonics to “remove toxins” from your body (unclear which toxins, and Mayo Clinic debunked that too), to letting bees sting you to “get rid of inflammation and scarring” (which killed a woman in Spain - and all of this is even without mentioning the jade egg controversy. In a similar vein, Twitter user @Leishman writes, “Can’t wait to buy my magic crystals with bitcoin! This is what the world needs,” while @CAntkow writes, “So this explains the price dropping…”  Paltrow is also far from the first celebrity to show interest in crypto. From 50 Cent - who claimed bankruptcy - over Steven Seagal, to Ashton Kutcher, many have dipped their toes into the nascent industry. Even Kim Kardashian mentioned Bitcoin to her 114 million followers."
1," In a newly released ranking of digital assets by the Chinese government-affiliated organization China Center for Information Industry Development (CCID), Bitcoin – by far the most popular digital asset in the world – has fallen to 19th place. The ranking, titled Global Public Blockchain Technology Assessment Index, assesses crypto projects based on criteria such as technology, applicability, and creativity, among other things. This time around, EOS secured the top spot, followed by Ethereum (ETH) and BitShares (BTS). A total of 33 public blockchain projects were assessed in the ranking. EOS is the fifth most valuable digital asset by market capitalization, while ETH is number two, and BTS is number 34. This is now the sixth time the ranking is released, and bitcoin has fallen consistently from the 13th place in the first ranking to the 19th place now. On the flip-side, however, EOS and Ethereum are two of the projects that have consistently gotten high rankings in the report, securing the first and second place in the past five ranking reports. “At present, EOS and Ethereum are undoubtedly the preferred platforms for dapp [decentralized application] development worldwide, and EOS is showing stronger momentum,” a translation of the report read. In a previous issue of the report, the authors also praised EOS, saying it received the number one spot because of its “outstanding technical advantages in transaction confirmation efficiency, network throughput, and transaction costs.” The fact that EOS secured the number one spot on the ranking is particularly interesting in the light of a new study from blockchain testing company Whiteblock, which shockingly concluded that “EOS is not a blockchain,” but rather a distributed homogeneous database management system. “EOS block producers are highly centralized and users can only access the network using block producers as intermediaries. Block producers are a single point of failure for the entire system,” Whiteblock’s new report said."
1," During the past three sessions, there were mostly positive moves in bitcoin. BTC/USD traded in a tight range near the USD 6,450 support and it seems like it is preparing for the next upward move. On the other hand, ripple jumped sharply and traded above the USD 0.475, USD 0.500 and USD 0.520 resistance levels. Ethereum is slowly rebounding and it is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) placed above the USD 208 support area. Overall, technical indicators are signaling additional gains in bitcoin and altcoins as long as BTC/USD is above the USD 6,400 support. Total market capitalization  After trading above the USD 6,500 level, bitcoin price  started a downside correction. BTC/USD corrected below the USD 6,480 and USD 6,450 support levels. Later, the price bounced back above USD 6,450 and it is currently consolidating. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 6,500, above which the price will most likely rally to a new weekly high in the short term.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 6,450, below which the price may revisit the USD 6,420 and USD 6,405 support levels. Ethereum price  is placed nicely above the USD 208 support level. ETH/USD is slowly grinding higher and it seems like the price may trade above the USD 215 and USD 200 resistance levels.
Above USD 220, buyers may perhaps find a strong selling interest near the USD 225 level. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 208, below which the price is likely to test the USD 204 support. Bitcoin cash price  held the USD 550 support and it is currently consolidating recent gains. BCH/USD could resume its upward move above the USD 575 level and it may even break the USD 600 hurdle if buyers remain in action. On the downside, the main support is at USD 550, below which the price is likely to decline to USD 500.
Ripple price  rallied recently and broke many resistance levels such as USD 0.465, and USD 0.520. XRP/USD is placed in a solid uptrend and it seems like it could continue to climb towards the USD 0.550 and USD 0.560 levels. A few small cap coins traded higher today and registered gains more than 5%, including WAX, MAID, XLM and ETP. A few losers were POLY, RVN, LINK, WTC and RRK, which are down between 5%-7%. To sum up, bitcoin seems to be preparing for a fresh upward move above USD 6,500. If BTC/USD gains pace above USD 6,500, there are chances of a push towards USD 6,600 or even USD 6,750. Similarly, Ethereum, ripple and a few other major altcoins are placed nicely in an uptrend and they are likely to climb higher in the near term. In other news, the chairman of Deltec Bank & Trust says a widely scrutinized letter about stablecoin issuer Tether's  account at the Bahamas-based institution is ""authentic,"" Coindesk reported.

1," The bearish sentiment around bitcoin sank to three-month lows earlier today as short positions placed on crypto exchange Bitfinex fell to their lowest level since August 5th. At approximately 11:00 UTC, the number of short positions dropped to 21,434, which represents a 33 percent drop in the past eight days alone. During the same time, longs – or positions that are betting on an increase in bitcoin’s price – also witnessed a notable increase of 10 percent, the current number of which (24,410) marks a three-week high.  Indeed, the sentiment here seems to be shifting in favor of the bulls. The price of bitcoin broke bearish from a historically tight, two-week range of just $139 on Oct. 29, yet sellers were not able to further capitalize on the bearish outcome.  As a result, the price of bitcoin has risen roughly 4 percent since then to return to the range and negate the technically bearish view in the short term.  What’s more, bitcoin bulls have market seasonality on their side. The fourth quarter of the fiscal year is traditionally bullish for bitcoin prices, specifically the month of November. Data reveals that bitcoin has only concluded November with a monthly percent loss once since 2010, in 2011.  Looking at the chart below, it’s perhaps no coincidence that shorts began their more-than-30 percent drop just a day before November began. BTC/USD Longs, Shorts, and Price  When a short or long trade becomes overcrowded, it tends to represent overbought or oversold market conditions. For example, a short squeeze, or rapid price increase occurs when an abundance of shorts are forced to cover in order to avoid a losing trading.  The same can occur for longs, too. If there are an abundance of longs and price begins to fall, those longing will likely need to close their trade and as result drive the price of the underlying asset lower and faster.  Although BTC shorts have taken a hit as of late, an abundance of longs has yet to pile up. Data shows only 53 percent of the leverage positions on Bitfinex are longs, meaning 47 percent are shorts.  The relatively even ratio shows longs are not yet an overwhelming favorite, but it’s worth keeping in mind that the higher the percentage of longs, the more likely the price of bitcoin is to experience a pullback in the near term due to the overbought market conditions it would create, as was witnessed at the beginning of September.

1," That bitcoin (BTC) has likely found a bottom around $6,000 is now generally accepted, so the challenge for investors and traders is to spot the early signs of a long-awaited bullish reversal. Basic technical theory suggests that a bearish-to-bullish trend change is confirmed after the price invalidates a “lower highs” pattern – a series of descending peaks. As such, bitcoin needs to rise above the September high of $7,400 to confirm a major bullish breakout. That would mean the number one cryptocurrency by market cap needs to rally close to 16 percent from the current price of $6,400 before the bulls can claim victory over the bears. Seasoned traders, however, are always on the lookout for patterns that might allow them to front-run an impending textbook bullish reversal. In bitcoin’s case, the 3-day chart – on which each candlestick represents price action over a 72-hour period – is signaling that the prospects of bullish reversal would rise sharply if prices can clear the former support-turned-resistance of the 50-candle simple moving average (SMA). As of writing, BTC is trading at $6,420 on Coinbase, representing a 0.5 percent drop in a 24-hour basis.  The 50-candle SMA marked on the chart served as a strong support, or buying level, during the entire rally from October 2015 to December 2017. The SMA support became resistance in February after prices had dropped, and stayed in that role over the months since. Notably, the recent lower price high of $7,400 was created at the SMA hurdle, so a break above that resistance could be considered an early sign of bullish reversal. It’s worth noting that BTC’s bullish break above the 50-candle SMA in July ended up trapping the bulls on the wrong side of the market. Even so, the failed breakout was likely a result of the investor disappointment following the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s rejection of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) at the time. Looking ahead, BTC is unlikely to trap the bulls this time round, as the majority of bad news has been priced in. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

1," In the previous analysis, we discussed that bitcoin and ripple could resume bullish moves. BTC/USD did move higher in the past few sessions and broke the USD 6,450 resistance level. Ethereum price also gained bullish momentum and broke the USD 205 and USD 208 resistance levels. Also, bitcoin cash rallied after the cryptocurrency exchange, Binance announced support for the upcoming Bitcoin Cash hard fork. BCH/USD traded above the USD 500 resistance to move into a bullish zone. The current sentiment (UTC 08:30 AM)  in the market is positive. Total market capitalization  After forming a base above the USD 6,300 level, bitcoin price  started an upward move. BTC/USD traded above the USD 6,400 and USD 6,450 resistance levels. The price even broke the USD 6,500, but buyers failed to hold gains. As a result, there was a downside correction and the price tested the USD 6,450 support.
BTC/USD is currently up 1.3% to USD 6,475 and it seems like it could make another attempt to surpass the USD 6,500 resistance. On the downside, the main weekly supports are visible near the USD 6,450 and USD 6,400 levels.  Ethereum price  also followed bitcoin and gained bullish momentum above the key USD 200 barrier. ETH/USD traded above the USD 205 and USD 208 resistance levels to place itself in a bullish zone.
On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 210 followed by the weekly hurdle at USD 225. On the downside, the broken resistance at USD 200 is likely to act as a strong weekly support for buyers this week. Bitcoin cash price  rallied above the USD 500 barrier and spiked towards the USD 600 handle. Later, BCH/USD corrected lower and tested the USD 550 support. The price is currently up more than 5%, with an immediate resistance at USD 580. On the downside, the key supports are at USD 550 and USD 520.
Ripple price  is up more than 2% and it is currently trading near the USD 0.467 level. On the upside, XRP/USD buyers are facing important resistances near the USD 0.475 and USD 0.485 levels. Above these, the weekly resistance is at USD 0.500. Most altcoins gained more than 5% today, including DCN, BTG, DASH, VERI, WAX, MKR, DROP, MIOTA, MITH and BCN. While BAT showed strong growth on listing news.  Overall, bitcoin price is trading in a positive zone above the USD 6,400 weekly support. The current price action is positive, and if buyers clears the USD 6,500 hurdle, there could be continuous gains in BTC/USD and altcoins in the coming days. If not, bitcoin could correct gains and revisit the USD 6,400 support level in the near term.

1," Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative. The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers. Rekt? You should see the other guy. For anyone concerned about bitcoin losing another 4 percent in October to post its third straight monthly loss, it’s worth comparing that loss to those seen by traditional financial markets. By standard measures, last month was the worst on Wall Street since the 2008 financial crisis. The Nasdaq lost 9.2 percent, the Dow Jones Industrials, 6.9 percent, and the S&P 500, 5.1 percent. Riskier markets such as tech stocks and emerging markets were hit especially hard. A 4 percent decline is still hefty. But given its past volatility, the lead cryptocurrency’s relative stability amid the angst on the Street is notable. The general impression produced by last year’s wild crypto bubble was that bitcoin and all other such tokens exist at the extreme end of the speculative class of assets. So, if world markets become risk-averse, as they did severely last month, the thinking was that people would dump bitcoin along with every other high-risk asset in their flight to dollars. Instead, up until Monday, October 30, when bitcoin suffered a $200 drop, it was more or less stable. By crypto standards, it was a boring month. It might be tempting to conclude that bitcoin is attracting a safe-haven bid, that people are looking to hedge their risks with a stable-yet-liquid asset that’s immune from the politics of financial crises. The idea is that bitcoin is starting to assert itself as a new type of uncorrelated reserve asset, a digital gold for the digital age. But the truth is there is very little of this safe-haven buying going on in bitcoin prices right now. There was no noticeable spike in transactions last month, just more of the very, very gradual increase that has occurred off the low base reached during the post-bubble period of the late winter. While there are surely some newcomers shifting their assets into bitcoin, especially in places like Venezuela, there’s no great wave of people suddenly realizing that this new digital asset might be a hedge against future political and economic turmoil. So why did this notoriously volatile asset have a relatively quiet October? One way to think about it is to reflect on the changing nature of the bitcoin investment community, which can be divided into speculators and buy-and-holders – better known as hodlers. The speculators who dominated the community last year have gone – certainly the newcomers who drove the bitcoin price to its ridiculous peak above $19,000 in December. You know the type: your mother, your cousin or that high school friend you hadn’t spoken to for years who asked for tips on what coins to buy. That leaves the hodlers, the true believers, those in it for the long term. These people are far less likely to care about turmoil in world markets putting their dollar-based wealth at risk. Many don’t even measure their risk exposure in dollar terms. They don’t – at least to a point. You see, here’s the thing: This remaining community of hodlers may soon be the guinea pigs in a much more important bitcoin stress test. What happens if, as a number of market prognosticators believe, things get truly nasty economically? I mean 2008-like nasty, when a financial crisis morphed into a full-blown economic crisis. Will these diehards resist liquidating their bitcoin assets then? The answer may be a function of their real-world economic profiles. Do most of them comprise developers and entrepreneurs paid in bitcoin and ether whose expenditures are also largely for goods and services remunerated in the same? If they can subsist in the crypto economy, then maybe they’ll keep hodling. If they do hang on, they’ll give bitcoin an impressive show of stability. Amid economic chaos, such resilience would look quite impressive to the outside world, potentially drawing another round of newcomers into the mix – not speculative “too the moon” lambo-hunters but people who get the idea that this is a valuable hedging asset for the digital economy. The number of people who live in that crypto-dominant economy is bigger than is recognized by crypto critics, who tend to see every action of this community through the lens of investors marking their profits and losses to market in dollar terms. Still, it’s difficult to say whether this group is big enough to offset the many others for whom a serious 2008-like blow to their fiat incomes will drive them to liquidate bitcoin along with other assets. Complicating matters is the fact that a host of new exchanges, custodial services and trading platforms are coming that could attract large institutions into this market. There might be a sizable amount of Wall Street money coming into bitcoin over the coming year. Bitcoin speculators hoping to turn their holdings into dollar-based fortunes tend to see this as a positive prospect, assuming the influx of funds will drive up the price. But while that might happen in the short term, the experience of last year, when short-selling accompanied the introduction of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s and Chicago Board Options Exchange’s cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts, is that these professional solutions can also invite volatility. These new institutional tools give the big guys greater capacity to get in, but they also give them the means to get out. Hedge funds are definitely not interested in hodling for holding’s sake. This stability may not last, in other words. It’s another matter whether that provides the kind of stress test that bitcoin needs to prove itself as a reserve asset.

1," Bitcoin could be about to make a move towards $6,800, having witnessed a bullish breakout yesterday. The leading cryptocurrency, which had been in a narrowing price range, moved upwards to close at $6,423 yesterday, confirming an upside breakout of the symmetrical triangle pattern. With the move, the bulls look to have come out victorious in a months-long tug-of-war with the bears. However, BTC is struggling to find acceptance above the immediate resistance of the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $6,450. The EMA hurdle might be crossed in a day or two, though, as the ethereum-bitcoin exchange rate (ETH/BTC) is looking north, marking rising demand for alternative cryptocurrencies. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,400 on Coinbase, having clocked a high of $6,440 earlier today. The cryptocurrency is up 1 percent on a 24-hour basis and is largely unchanged week-on-week.  The symmetrical triangle breakout seen in the above chart indicates scope for a re-test of recent highs above $6,800. That target looks achievable as the breakout is backed by a bullish crossover on the moving average convergence divergence (MACD). Further, the relative strength index is holding in bullish territory just above 50.00.  The falling channel breakout and a convincing move above the former support-turned-resistance of 0.031994 (Sept. 25 low) indicates a bearish-to-bullish trend change. The rising MACD histogram is suggesting that further gains could be in the offing. The RSI of 53.00 is biased toward the bulls. Thus, ETH/BTC looks set to rise in the near future.

1," After forming a decent support near the USD 6,300 level, bitcoin price traded higher. BTC/USD broke the USD 6,350 level and traded close to the USD 6,450 resistance recently. Similarly, ethereum price traded close to the USD 204 level and it is currently consolidating. Ripple remained in a bullish zone and traded above the USD 0.455 level. It seems the market sentiment is slowly improving (UTC 08:30 AM) and sellers are exhausted. Therefore, if buyers gain momentum, there could be more bullish moves in bitcoin above USD 6,450 and 6,500 in the coming sessions.  Total market capitalization  There were positive moves in bitcoin price  above the USD 6,350 level recently. BTC/USD traded above the USD 6,400 resistance to enter a bullish zone. However, the price failed to clear the USD 6,450 level and later it started a downside correction. 
The price is currently consolidating near the USD 6,450 level and it seems like it could climb higher once again. If it corrects further lower, buyers might appear near the USD 6,390 and USD 6,350 levels. On the upside, a break above the USD 6,450 resistance could push the price towards the USD 6,500 hurdle. Ethereum price  also moved higher and broke the USD 197 and USD 199 resistances. ETH/USD also spiked towards the USD 204 level before retreating back to USD 200.
The price is currently testing the USD 200 level, below which it could test the USD 198 level. If there are further declines, sellers are likely to take control for a push towards the USD 190 level in the near term. Bitcoin cash price  is slowly moving higher, but it is still struggling to clear the USD 430 resistance. BCH/USD may gain traction if there is a break above the USD 430 and USD 440 resistance levels. The main supports on the downside are USD 420 and USD 410.
Ripple price  remained in a bullish zone and moved above the USD 0.455 resistance. XRP/USD traded close to the USD 0.460 level and it is currently consolidating gains. If there is a break above the USD 0.460 resistance, the price may climb towards USD 0.475. A few small cap coins traded higher today and gained between 5%-12%, including RVN, BAT, ZRX, WAX, SRAT and CNX. Out of these, RVN gained around 10% and BAT is up roughly 7%. Overall, bitcoin is slowly recovering and if there is a strong move above the USD 6,450 resistance, buyers are likely to take control. On the other hand, if BTC/USD fails to stay above USD 6,400, it could decline back towards USD 6,300. Major altcoins like ethereum and ripple are also trading with a bullish angle and they might trade steadily higher.

1," With the number of strong support levels increasing for bitcoin (BTC), the bitcoin bears are facing an uphill battle. The latest addition to the list is the support of the trendline connecting the November 2011 and August 2016 lows, currently at $5,830. Up to Oct. 31, the two key support levels were the 21-month EMA and the trendline drawn between the June and August lows. In particular, the 21-month EMA was the level to beat for the bears till last month, meaning a close below that support would likely have revived the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 seen last December. While the 21-month EMA still remains a crucial support, the new make-or-break level is the seven-year-long rising trendline. That’s because the trendline support, which was located around $5,300 last month, has now moved closer to the current price and is seen rising above $6,300 in December. Hence, it may now be incorrect to call a break below the 21-month EMA a sign of a bear revival. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,330 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.5 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  On the monthly chart, a break below the trendline support of $5,830 would strengthen the bear grip and allow a drop to the psychological support of $5,000. The bulls, however, would feel emboldened if the cryptocurrency produces a strong bounce off that key support. As for the next 24 hours, investors should keep an eye on the symmetrical triangle seen in the chart below.  The upper edge of the symmetrical triangle, currently at $6,400, is proving a tough nut to crack on the daily chart. A break above that level would put the bulls in a commanding position, opening the doors for a rally to $6,756 (Oct. 15 high).

1," Global investment bank Morgan Stanley has given Bitcoin bulls something to cheers about. The institution has stated that it classes Bitcoin as an institutional investment class. (And the day after Bitcoin’s birthday… how thoughtful) What this means is that it recognizes Bitcoin as a type of asset similar to shares, property, bonds, cash, or commodities. It also means good news for those hoping for a Bitcoin ETF. The bank’s research division reviewed the last six months of Bitcoin usage. What the researchers discovered was that permanent ledger technologies, hacks, hard forks, Bitcoin competitors, and market volatility have led to a conclusion that the most sensible way to classify BTC is as an institutional investment class. The researchers concluded that Bitcoin is not just a digital payment system or financial network, but an asset class in its own right. According to Coindesk: “Perhaps most notably, the report emphasized its ‘rapidly morphing thesis,’ which began by defining bitcoin as ‘digital cash’ and noting that investors had full confidence in it, to a solution for issues in the financial system, to a new payment system to ultimately a new institutional investment class.” The report detailed further: “Various issues and discoveries around the bitcoin ecosystem have caused the thesis to evolve, including the permanent ledger recording all transactions, a number of hacks, hard forks, new technologies which are cheaper than bitcoin, market volatility and other concerns.” >> Jamie Dimon Knocks Down Bitcoin Again Bitcoin has evolved. At present, $7.11 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) is being stored by hedge funds or capital firms. This is somewhat hypocritical as the original whitepaper of Bitcoin looked to avoid involvement with financial institutions. But adoption by major financial institutions is increasing, and it only serves to support the coin as a legitimate asset. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is up 0.94% today and selling for $6388, according to coinmarketcap.com. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© wolterke"
1," JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has always been tough when it comes to his stance on Bitcoin (BTC). Back in September of 2017, Dimon even went as far as calling it a “fraud.” He later retracted his statement and said that he was wrong for calling it a fraud but was still wary of the digital currency. Well, it seems Dimon has something different to say about Bitcoin now. Again. Two days ago at an AXIOS conference, the CEO was asked about changing his mind on Bitcoin, and he said, “I never changed what I said, I just regret having said it,” CNBC reported. Dimon continued by saying: “I didn’t want to be the spokesman against Bitcoin (BTC). I don’t really give a s*&^, that’s the point—okay? But Blockchain is real, it’s technology, Bitcoin is not the same as fiat currency.” Most major banking CEOs around the globe have taken a very similar stance on the matter. Nearly a year ago, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) CEO James Gordon stated that despite Bitcoin rising 700 percent in 2017, the digital currency was the definition of a “speculative investment and anyone thinking it might be stable is deluding themselves.” Gorman goes on to describe Bitcoin as “not even close to a safe investment.” >> Coinbase will Add Nearly 300 Coins in the Next Year but Won’t IPO Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is the exception among most major US banks. GS has been very pro digital currencies and is even recently rumored to have started onboarding some of its clients to sign up for its future crypto projects. There has yet to be an official statement from the bank on the matter, but the support shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, as the bank has been vocal about its crypto plans in the past. Despite the negative outlook on digital currency from Jamie Dimon and most of the major banks around the world, many of them  are working with some form of blockchain technology behind the scenes, to see if it can improve their day-to-day operations Just a few days ago, it was reported that nine Japenese banks have states using a Fujitsu blockchain settlement trial.

1," Although we all know that long-term “hodling” and cold storage devices that are locked down for years at a time, has always been a part of the bitcoin community, new data compiled by the US-based cryptoasset analytics firm Coin Metrics for Bloomberg reveals more about the true extent of it. According to the data, 3 out of every 4 bitcoin in existence has not moved at all over the past 6 months, despite the downturn in the bitcoin market. The finding marks a big change from the situation during the bitcoin rally in late 2017, when about half of all bitcoins had been on the move. “It tells me we are still in a Bitcoin recession” https://t.co/sYJ19eJg0K pic.twitter.com/yInVvA9Shj The finding might be also surprising given the large number of new investors who flocked to bitcoin during the huge price rally of 2017. One might imagine that most of these new investors would be “weak hands” in the bitcoin market, susceptible to selling their holdings once the price moved lower. This, however, seems not to have been the case, which suggests that we have not seen the capitulation in the market many have been waiting for. According to many long-term believers in bitcoin, a “total capitulation” is needed for the market to finally find a bottom and form a strong foundation for the next bull market. “It tells me we are still in a Bitcoin recession,” Nic Carter, co-founder of Coin Metrics, told Bloomberg in a comment. According to Coin Metrics, up to 40% of bitcoins rarely moves because they are either lost or held in long-term cold storage. The firm further estimates that another 25% to 35% can be considered semi-liquid, which means they become active during bull markets as some long-term investors cash out to secure profits. Previously, research by weekly cryptocurrency publication Diar has revealed that over one third of the total bitcoin supply, or 55% of circulating bitcoin, is held in wallets with more than 200 BTC in each that have never made an outgoing transaction. Still, 27% of these wallets have continued to accumulate coins during the bear market in anticipation of the next leg up in the bitcoin market, the research showed."
1," Veteran Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs is launching a type of derivatives contracts of bitcoin for selected clients, according to a unsourced report by The Block.  Derivatives are tradeable instruments that gives a trader exposure to the price movement of an asset – in this case bitcoin – without owning the actual bitcoin. Specifically, the bank has reportedly onboarded clients to trade its forward contracts on bitcoin, a type of derivative that is tied to the futures market, The Block reported this week, citing a “direct source.” In other words, crypto trading at Goldman Sachs is still strictly limited to derivatives, and does not involve any “physical” cryptocurrencies changing hands.  However, the bank is in no rush to roll out more crypto derivatives products, according to the report. The source also said that earlier reports that Goldman is exploring similar derivatives contracts for ether “isn’t accurate.” The steps taken by Goldman Sachs in the crypto world is watched by many in the community due to its fame and position as one of the most prominent financial institutions in the world. ‘If Goldman Sachs embraces crypto, everyone else will too’, the reasoning goes. It is already known that Goldman Sachs is working to set up a trading desk for cryptocurrency derivatives. Back in September, Goldman’s Chief Financial Officer Marty Chavez (he’s leaving the post on November 5 to become Vice Chairman of the firm and Co-Head of the Securities Division) stated publicly that no plans had changed in regards to the trading desks, despite earlier reports that the bank would postpone the plans.   In the past, Goldman Sachs has also invested in a number of blockchain-related companies, including Circle and the California-based blockchain security company BitGo, in a funding round that brought in USD 58.5 million from several prominent investors."
0," Today marks 10 years of Bitcoin; its original white paper was released onto the internet on Halloween day, 2008. What began as an idea to challenge the financial establishment, has since grown to become a $110 billion market. The purpose of Bitcoin was straightforward; the digital asset, as a “purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”  By logging every transaction on a distributed ledger called the blockchain, the issue of “double spending” would also be solved. The ledger can be seen by anyone to verify that the transaction occurred. The network records every transaction and adds them to this ongoing chain, forming a log or record that can’t be changed or erased. As everyone has access to the network, no one body has control of it. Therefore it is secure and transparent. Blockchain technology is widely considered the most important innovation to come out of the creation of Bitcoin. So much so that this ‘distributed ledger’ technology has since been implemented by industries outside of cryptocurrency, including banking, farming, and healthcare. But those are only a few examples, and the list of adoption is constantly growing. Its first ten years has seen the digital currency spark mania. It has spawned hoards of imitator coins, it has risen to unprecedented values (20,000 per Bitcoin in 2017), and it has started an industry now rife with multi-billion dollar exchanges. Not to mention an industry of miners and blockchain coders. Bitcoin is even catching the attention of some of the world’s most powerful financial institutions despite being created to circumvent them. So, from such a small acorn came a ground-shaking oak tree. Invented by an anonymous cryptographer who went by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, on Halloween day, 2008, he, she, or they, wrote Bitcoin’s whitepaper and posted it to the world. Many have made claims to who Satoshi really is; Elon Musk was considered. He denied the claim. Some believe Nakamoto is a Japanese coder. But others believe the English on the whitepaper is too perfect and colloquial to not have been written by a native English speaker. So its first 10 years have seen massive financial gains and losses for hodlers of the coin. What will the next 10 years bring? Bitcoin’s original whitepaper has paved the way for technical advances that have occurred around Bitcoin. The value of the coin will always remain unpredictable, but the technological systems are only getting more advanced and more widespread. >> Coinbase is Now Valued at over $8 Billion After Series E Funding Round As developers and software engineers create different applications that improve the way we use Bitcoin and interact with the blockchain, user-experience is expected to improve: “Much like as internet based technology has improved over the years, mainstream Bitcoin users will understand very little of how the underlying protocols operate—they will simply follow the guidance of the applications they run on their machines.” Decentralization will obviously be a part of the future, but it will be interesting to note what industries adopt blockchain technology. One thing is for sure, Bitcoin turning 10 years old serves to remind us of how much this digital currency has changed the face of the current financial and technological era. Anything that can do that much in so little time paves the way for bigger things in the future. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© dmvasilenko"
0," Yesterday, bitcoin price moved into a bearish zone below the USD 6,400 support level. BTC/USD is currently consolidating above the USD 6,300 level, but there are a lot of bearish signs visible on lower timeframe charts. Equally, ethereum is trading below the USD 200 support with a negative bias, which could spark a fresh decline towards the USD 180 level.  Other major altcoins like dash, bitcoin cash, neo and litecoin are struggling to recover. They are trading near yearly lows and remain at a risk of more losses. LTC/USD is currently trading well below the Oct 31, 2017 low of USD 56.00 and just above the US 47.80 yearly low. It seems like litecoin could decline further to trade to a new yearly low below USD 47.00 if it continues to struggle. Similarly, dash, neo and bitcoin cash are down and trading well below levels seen one year ago on Oct 31, 2017. More importantly, if sellers remain in action, these coins could accelerate declines and trade to a new 2018 low in the near term. Total market capitalization  After yesterday’s decline bitcoin price  found support near the USD 6,300 level and later started consolidating losses. BTC/USD is currently trading above the USD 6,330 level with an immediate resistance at USD 6,360. However, main hurdles for buyers are USD 6,380 and USD 6,400, above which the price might move back in a positive zone.
On the other hand, if the price fails to recover, it may perhaps slide back towards USD 6,300. Any further declines will most likely push the price towards the USD 6,250 support area. Ethereum price  is currently consolidating losses below the USD 200 level. ETH/USD seems to be preparing for the next decline if buyers fail to push the price back above the USD 200 and USD 202 resistance levels.
On the downside, an immediate support is at USD 195, below which the price could trade to a new monthly low. The main support for buyers on the downside is near the USD 180 level. Bitcoin cash price  is struggling a lot below the USD 430 level. It seems like BCH/USD may continue to slide and it could break the USD 400 handle as well to form a new yearly low. 
Ripple price  is slowly declining towards the USD 0.440 support. If XRP/USD fails to stay above the USD 0.440 support, sellers may well gain strength to take the price towards the USD 0.420 level. On the upside, resistances are seen near USD 0.450 and 0.455. Despite the current market sentiment, a few small cap coins traded higher between 6%-12%, including dentacoin, chainlink and pivx.
Overall, bitcoin price is slowly approaching key supports like USD 6,250, below which there is a risk of a sharp decline. If buyers continue to struggle, there is a possibility of a larger downward move in bitcoin, ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin, dash, neo and other major cryptocurrencies.

0," The beginning of 2019 might bring tax-related news to the UK’s crypto market.  Her Majesty's (HM) Treasury is working closely with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to consider the tax issues raised by cryptoassets and the revised guidance is estimated to be released by early 2019, according to a new report from the UK’s Cryptoasset Taskforce, jointly published by HM Treasury, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and the Bank of England.  Both authorities recognise the risks of tax avoidance and evasion arising from the increased use of cryptoassets and are continuing to review the range of enforcement tools and approaches at HMRC’s disposal, the report added.   Also, in the report, several heavy-handed measures are discussed to regulate and control how British citizens should interact with digital assets. In the report, the FCA – the UK’s main financial regulator – said that “there are substantial potential risks associated with cryptoassets” and that the government’s priority is to “mitigate” these risks, “and prevent the use of cryptoassets for illicit activity.” The authors added that “strong action” should be taken by the authorities to address the perceived risks. Perhaps the most severe action proposed in the report is a potential ban on all cryptoasset derivatives, including futures contracts and contracts for difference (CFDs), which are all popular instruments among traders. According to the report, “the FCA will consult on a prohibition of the sale to retail consumers of all derivatives referencing exchange tokens such as Bitcoin, including CFDs, futures, options and transferable securities.” The futures market, for example, is already a heavily regulated marketplace where large traders either take bets, or hedge risks from elsewhere, with the use of contracts that track the price of an underlying asset – in this case bitcoin.  Ironically, an active futures market for bitcoin has been mentioned as a requirement from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for it to approve any bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF). Now, it appears the UK is moving in the opposite direction as it seeks to ban any futures contracts based on cryptoassets such as bitcoin. Meanwhile, the report stressed that “the authorities will continue to encourage and enable experimentation and innovation, so that DLT [distributed ledger technology] and other new technologies can develop and be adopted safely in the financial system.”   It also added, that “the backbone of the existing payments system – the Bank of England’s new RTGS [real-time gross settlement] service - will be compatible with DLT - based payment systems, supporting further innovation and use of DLT in financial services.” Although the report did also list potential benefits of cryptoassets, they were few compared to the risks discussed.  The report noted that cryptoassets today deliver few benefits, but added that “benefits may materialize in the future, for example through the use of ICOs [initial coin offerings] as a capital raising tool.” In the community, people are discussing whether the proposed regulations by the Cryptoasset Taskforce are appropriate, with some even asking if the agency is going far enough: UK moves in the right direction to provide regulatory certainty on #cryptoassets and #cryptocurrency.  I'm sure a welcome development. However, will it be enough? https://t.co/rc2XiV3LR6 Others, however, question the authors’ level of understanding of the subject matter: It's also funny that the Cryptoasset Taskforce calls cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin ""exchange tokens"" pic.twitter.com/OifROyT64n In the past, the FCA led a group of global regulators known as the Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN) in drafting a consultation document on the issue of regulatory sandboxes for fin-tech firms. Among other things, the document proposed that regulators in different countries should work together to “support responsible innovation” in areas such as distributed ledger technology and ICOs, as well as requirements pertaining to know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML)."
0," A US citizen from California has just pled guilty in federal court for operating an “unlicensed money business” selling Bitcoin (BTC), called LocalBitcoins.com. The Department of Justice (DoJ) released a press release about the case yesterday, October 29th. Jacob Burrell Campos has admitted to selling “hundreds of thousands” of dollars in Bitcoin (BTC) to over 1,000 customers on LocalBitcoins.com. The transactions took place from January 2015 to April 2016. The DoJ has characterized his sales as an unregistered ‘Bitcoin exchange.’ Burrell failed to register his business with the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the US Department of Treasury and did not apply due diligence on the sources of his client’s funds, such as AML. “Unlicensed money transmitting businesses, especially those operating at or near the border, pose a serious threat to the integrity of the US banking system, and provide an ‘open door’ for criminals to utilize such businesses to launder the proceeds of their illicit activities,” said US Attorney Adam Braverman. “The Department of Justice will continue to investigate and prosecute all individuals and businesses that seek to evade the licensing and anti-money laundering requirements under federal law.” In addition to failing to comply with federal regulations, Burrell admitted that his account on an unnamed US crypto exchange had been closed due to suspicious transactions. >> World Crypto Con: Joel Comm and Travis Wright Host the Show! After being shut down on that exchange, he turned to a Hong Kong-based platform and purchased $2.29 million worth of Bitcoin in a two-year span. Burrell conducted hundreds of transactions with this exchange from March 2015 to April 2017. The press release concludes with Burrell admitting that his exchanged USD was stored in Mexico. He has also pled guilty to making a false declaration on his federal tax return and is awaiting that trial in mid-December. Burrell imported over $1 million between late-2016 to early 2017, to evade tax declaration. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© stevanovicigor"
0," If we are to believe recent headlines, bitcoin may single handedly be responsible for pushing global warming beyond 2 degrees Celsius and ruin the environment for future generations.  “Bitcoin may cause catastrophic climate change by 2033,” The Telegraph warned in an article on Monday. “Bitcoin is actually going to ruin the world,” CNET wrote, while Israeli newspaper Haaretz warned us that “[…] Bitcoin is making the world dangerously hotter, dangerously fast.” These headlines are just some of the articles that were published yesterday following a new research report by an interdisciplinary team of scientists from the University of Hawaii, published in Nature, an international journal of science. According to the report, bitcoin “could alone produce enough CO2  (carbon dioxide) emissions to push warming above 2°C within less than three decades.” However, at the same time the authors acknowledge that bitcoin mining is becoming more energy efficient. Meanwhile, other experts and scientist who spoke with ThinkProgess, a news website backed by the think tank Center for American Progress Action Fund, described the study’s assumptions and conclusions as “reckless” and “dangerous, irresponsible, and misleading.”  According to mechanical engineering professor Eric Masanet, head of the Energy and Resource Systems Analysis Lab at Northwestern University, the conclusions in the study can be debunked by pointing to three flaws: First, he said, “we know that the global power sector is decarbonizing.” Secondly, the IT sector, including mining of cryptocurrencies, is becoming more and more energy efficient. Lastly, he said the authors behind the study are “insisting on tremendous growth in cryptocurrency adoption, resulting in inflated and dubious estimates of future carbon emissions.” Arman Shehabi of Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, a Department of Energy Office of Science lab managed by University of California, agreed with Masanet, and added that the authors of the study were on the wrong track by focusing on a very unlikely scenario where “the electricity demand of bitcoin transactions and the carbon emissions from that electricity demand both remain static over the next hundred years, while at the same time bitcoin immediately undergoes rapid adoption.” He told ThinkProgress that it is “absurd” to believe the energy consumption of each individual bitcoin transaction will remain constant over the next hundred years, saying “that’s a crazy assumption in general, but downright bananas for blockchain mining.” Back in August, Katrine Kelly-Pitou, Research Associate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh also said that the worries about bitcoin’s energy usage are exaggerated. Instead, she argues, the important factor is not how much energy bitcoin consumes, but what the energy sources are, while advocating for more mining in countries and regions with an abundant supply of clean and renewable energy. According to Kelly-Pitou, bitcoin mining uses an exorbitant amount of power: somewhere between an estimated 30 terrawatt hours alone in 2017 alone, while banking consumes an estimated 100 terrawatts of power annually."
0," Banks in Panama, which is one of the Top 20 countries by crypto ATMs per capita, appear to be refusing cryptocurrency transactions, per media reports, sparking fears that a crackdown has begun. Per newspaper La Estrella de Panama, “a handful of users” have claimed that their bank accounts – and those of their cryptocurrency-trading acquaintances – “were closed upon [the banks] learning that they traded in cryptocurrencies or just for having [crypto holdings].” Trading in cryptocurrencies is not illegal in Panama, a country with the population of 4 million, but the newspaper stated “it seems that the financial sector has gone from caution to rejection.” Crypto community leaders bemoaned the fact that their relationship with the banks “has been very, very complicated” so far. The newspaper says it has been in touch with several banks in the country, which have all so far chosen not to respond on the matter. It quotes Felipe Echandi, co-founder of Panama Fintech, a Panamanian blockchain community and pressure group, as stating, “I don’t work with cryptocurrencies personally, but I do know of cases where [banks have refused to deal with clients involved with cryptocurrencies].” Echandi added, “Unfortunately in Panama, in the case of fintech enterprises, it is very complicated for banks to open accounts. I had to go explain my own business model 50 times to different banks.” The country’s banking regulator, the Superintendency of Banks of Panama, has previously warned the public about the “risks” associated with trading in cryptocurrencies, stating that government regulations do not cover the exchange, purchase, sale or investment of digital tokens. The lack of regulation in the crypto and blockchain space, especially for projects that raised funds through initial coin offerings (ICOs), is keeping even compliant projects from working, as previously reported by Cryptonews.com. Some projects eve complain that ""If you’re a good citizen complying with accounting, opening bank accounts, doing everything correctly, you can still get hit every single week by institutions, service providers, partners that tell you they’re not working with you anymore just because you’re dealing with cryptocurrencies.""

0," The crypto market is suffering huge losses across the board today. And leading the drop-off is the largest coin by market cap; Bitcoin dropped from over $6,500 to a new two-week low of $6,243 in early trade today. The coin has lost over $200 in a 24-hour period, and as happens more commonly than not, there is no definite reason for the sudden drop. The sudden Bitcoin drop has come somewhat as a surprise. The world’s biggest coin has been hovering between $6,600 and $6,400 for 14-days straight. A stint that has notably been its least volatile period in over a year. But perhaps the Bitcoin drop was overdue. The equities market is about to close its worst month since 2008’s financial crisis, and where that market threads, Bitcoin tends to follow. Across the board, we can see the effect of the Bitcoin drop. But maybe investors are shaking in their boots because of a new report released today about Bitcoin and climate concerns. A new study released has detailed the massive impact Bitcoin may have on climate change. The culprit, of course, is mining. The amount of electricity involved in the process has the potential to boost global temperatures by more than two degrees by 2033."
0," The world’s oldest surviving Bitcoin exchange, Bitstamp, has been bought by NXMH, a Belgium-based investment company. This represents yet another example of traditional investors moving into the cryptocurrency industry - a recent trend that has been on the uprise throughout 2018. Bitstamp CEO, Nejc Kodrič, writes in the official announcement, “Bitstamp has been regularly approached by suitors for quite some time. The reason why we finally decided to sell the company is a combination of the quality of the buyer, the quality of the offer and the fact that the industry is at a point where consolidation makes sense. A major factor in agreeing to the sale is that the mission, leadership and vision of the company remains the same.”  Through the purchase, NXMH acquires an 80% stake, while Kodrič retains a 10% ownership interest in the exchange, according to Reuters. Pantera Capital Management LP, which made a USD 10 million investment in the company in 2014, also sold part of its stake in Bitstamp to NXMH, the report added. NXMH, with assets under management of more than EUR 2 billion, is the European subsidiary of South Korea-based NXC, which invests in digital technologies. NXC also owns South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Korbit and Nexon, a South Korean gaming company.  Back in April this year, the exchange had been rumored to be in talks with Nexon regarding the acquisition. Nexon Korea CEO Lee Jung-hun denied the rumors that pegged the price of the exchange at around USD 350 million. In 2016, Bitstamp was valued at USD 60 million, Kodrič told Reuters today. Kodrič stresses that nothing about Bitstamp’s services will change: “We do anticipate that this acquisition will strengthen Bitstamp’s positioning for growth, which will provide opportunities to better serve our customers. Customers should not have any concerns about their accounts or changes to the way we operate,” he adds. Bitstamp was founded in 2011 in Slovenia by Kodrič and Damian Merlak. However, Marlek sold his entire 30% stake in Bitstamp with the deal, and has not been active since 2015, according to Reuters. The registration of the company was moved to the UK in April 2013, then to Luxembourg in 2016. The company was founded as a European-focused alternative to then-dominant bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. While the company trades in US dollars, it accepts fiat money deposits for free only via the European Union's Single Euro Payments Area, a mechanism for transferring money between European bank accounts. Top markets on Bitstamp: As traditional investors are moving into the space with increasing frequency, this seems to be the boost many companies need: after the Singapore-based BK Global Consortium bought a controlling share in South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb, trading shot up by some 25% over the following weekend.  Japan is another example of this trend. Coincheck was taken over by financial services company Monex earlier this year after falling victim to a hack in January, with another financial sector company, Fisco, set to complete the takeover of last month’s hack victim, Zaif, late next month, as Cryptonews.com previously reported. “Major companies are likely to continue targeting [exchanges] for a while yet,” wrote Japanese business media outlet M&A Online in an editorial piece."
0," In what appears to be one of the worst handlings of a crypto exchange crisis we have seen to date, MapleChange, a relatively small crypto exchange based in Edmonton, Canada, on Sunday announced that “someone have managed to withdraw all funds from our exchange,” adding that “until the investigation is over, we cannot refund anything.” Due to a bug, some people have managed to withdraw all the funds from our exchange. We are in the process of a thorough investigation for this. We are extremely sorry that it has to come to end like this. Until the investigation is over, we cannot refund anything. Later they added that “because we have no more funds to pay anyone back, the exchange has to close down unfortunately.” According to the archived version (October 28) of the exchange's website that claims it’s “a swift, reliable and to-the-point trading platform for veterans and newbies alike”, it has more than 8,000 registered users and it's daily trading volume was more than BTC 900 (USD 5.8 million) “today.” Meanwhile, on October 27, the exchange announced that its maintenance was “officially over and we have finished upgrading our server” and invited to “enjoy our new sleek look, stay tuned for future updates as we're not yet done.” As of Monday morning, the website is unavailable. Following the news yesterday, members of the community have been hard at work to find out who is behind the exchange, which does not provide information on its team members online. A Twitter account called Maplechange’ed has already identified the person they believe is behind the questionable exchange as a young man living in Edmonton, Canada, along with many other details about the people behind the exchange. Following the first Twitter post, the exchange disabled their Twitter account, and rumors of the “hack” actually being a classic exit scam quickly started circulating online.  6 Million Dollar Exit Scam. Rofl In case of an exit scam, someone who runs a crypto service first builds up trust among customers, who then go on to deposit money with the service. Once a sufficient amount of money or digital assets have been gathered, the service shuts down and the operators disappear. As many would probably agree, disabling social media and other communication channels “to think this solution through” is a highly suspicious way of handling what the company claims to be a hack.  However, five hours later, MapleChange’s Twitter account finally came back online with this tweet: We have not disappeared guys. We simply turned off our accounts temporarily to think this solution through. We cannot refund everyone all their funds, but we will be opening wallets to whatever we have left so people can (hopefully) withdraw their funds. The incident should serve as an important reminder to everyone in the crypto community not to keep fiat or crypto stored on any exchanges. Instead, it is generally recommended to transfer funds to external software or hardware wallets where the user holds the private keys, after a trade has been completed.

0," Last week, we reported that bitcoin prices are now nearly as stable as Apple stocks, however, it appears that we were just scratching the surface for how stable these prices can really become. It may be a sign that bitcoin is nearing a bottom, according to experts. However, no one knows when the next major move will happen.  Compared to last Monday, the bitcoin price is practically unchanged, giving developers the calm they need to put their heads down and work, while traders are becoming increasingly restless. Bitcoin price chart: Over the past 12 days, bitcoin prices have been so stable that technical analysts, who make trading decisions based on patterns and indicators on charts, are scratching their heads trying to figure out where the price is headed next. This is what the legendary trader Peter Brandt had to say on Twitter this weekend: 12 days in a 2.2% trading range. Not sure there is another similar period in BTC history. Equilibrium between supply and demand is amazing. Will not last long. $BTC pic.twitter.com/L4N5Sa06c3 As expected, the bitcoin community responded with a sense of humour, as they often do:  pic.twitter.com/oyZWz3w4FK In an article from CNBC this weekend, bitcoin’s record-low volatility is presented as surprising news given the sharp sell-off that occurred in the global stock market last week. “As U.S. stock markets went haywire this week, the major cryptocurrency known for giving investors whiplash was surprisingly calm,” according to the report. However, the network’s go-to guest for all-things crypto, CEO of crypto investment firm BKCM Brian Kelly, reminded that crypto remains a non-correlated asset class, saying “I don't know of anyone saying 'Microsoft dropped, I better sell bitcoin to cover my margin’.” Meanwhile, others argue that low volatility is a sign that bitcoin may be nearing a bottom. As Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone noted, high volatility is a major factor lessening most cryptocurrency use cases for anything other than speculation. In the same report by Bloomberg, Charlie Morris, multi-asset head at Atlantic House Fund Management in London, added that ""Given this bear market is now 10 months old and is getting tired, I’d be inclined to be bullish for the next major move.” In the meantime, Google searches do not show that people’s interest in bitcoin is picking up, which might mean that the market relies on existing investors, mostly.    Looking at global search interest for the word “bitcoin,” we can see that it is now at the lowest levels seen since April 2017, when the price of bitcoin was just over USD 1,000. Related terms like “buy bitcoin” or “trade bitcoin” gives us nearly identical results."
0," After nearly two weeks stagnating at around $6,400, bitcoin (BTC) has finally made a move – to the downside. At 12:00 UTC, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dropped nearly $200 to reach a two-week low of $6,243. For the last 14-days, bitcoin had been stuck in a range of $6,590-$6,403 – its least volatile stretch since April 2017, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The squeeze in bitcoin prices had been somewhat surprising, since the cryptocurrency has shown to be correlated with the equities markets which are about to end their worst month since the financial crisis in 2008. As a result, BTC’s move to the downside was perhaps overdue. The broader cryptocurrency market has also taken a hit over the last few hours, a common occurrence when bitcoin prices show weakness. Major cryptocurrencies including ether (ETH), XRP and bitcoin cash (BCH) are all reporting 24-hour losses above three percent. Litecoin (LTC) is the worst performing cryptocurrency out of top 10 by market cap, reporting a 24-hour loss of over five percent. Further, the press time total market value of all cryptocurrencies is down just over three percent on a 24-hour basis, currently being worth $203 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. While the lengthy period of consolidation has ended in a downward move, there are still several support levels that may help keep the bears at bay. BTC/USD Daily chart  On the daily chart (prices as per Coinbase), bitcoin’s price is currently testing two technical obstacles: the symmetrical triangle resistance (white dashed line) and the prior consolidation zone near $6,200 (blue zone). Following a breakout, price tends to return to the trendline and test for support – a “backtest” in technical analysis. With bitcoin back at $6,300 (BPI) at time of writing this update, that looks to be the current scenario. A bounce off of the trendline would be considered bullish whereas retreating inside the triangle would embolden the bears. The consolidation zone that shored up the price for five days before a $700 dollar rally to the monthly high of $6,810 on Oct. 15th may once again look to offer short-term support. If it fails, there’s another chance for support just below in the form of the four-month long ascending trendline (rising white line).

1," Bitcoin price extended range moves with a bearish angle below the USD 6,500 level. BTC/USD is currently (UTC 06:20 AM) struggling to hold the USD 6,450 support level and it seems like it could decline further in the near term. Similarly, ethereum price struggled to move higher and it is currently trading near the USD 200 support. If there is a downside break below USD 200, ETH/USD may possibly decline sharply. Ripple is comparatively stable above the USD 0.450 support, but it is facing a tough resistance near the USD 0.460 and USD 0.462 levels. Total market capitalization  There was no upward move above USD 6,500 in bitcoin price . BTC/USD remained under pressure and it slowly moved down towards the USD 6,450 support. At the outset, it seems like the price is struggling to remain above the USD 6,450 support and it could continue to move down towards the USD 6,400 support.
If sellers gain momentum, there is a risk of a downside break towards the USD 6,250 level in the near term. On the other hand, buyers need to clear the USD 6,500 and USD 6,550 barriers to push the price back in a positive zone. Ethereum price  also followed bitcoin as it struggled to break the USD 205 resistance zone. ETH/USD is currently moving lower towards the main support at USD 200.
If sellers succeed in gaining strength below the USD 200 support, the price may decline sharply towards the USD 190 or USD 185 level. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 205, above which the price may attempt to surpass USD 208 and USD 210. Bitcoin cash price  declined below the USD 440 support, which is a bearish sign. It seems like BCH/USD could continue to decline towards the next support at USD 425. The next key support below USD 425 is near the USD 405 level. The main resistance for an upward move is near the USD 450 level.
Ripple price  is currently consolidating above the USD 0.450 support. XRP/USD may climb further higher if there is a break above the USD 0.460 and USD 0.462 resistances. On the flip side, a break below USD 0.450 may increase bearish pressure on ripple. Today, a few altcoins gained more than 10%, including revain, kyber network (KNC), veritaseum and nexo. Out of these, revain rallied more than 30% and KNC gained around 25%. Overall, bitcoin price seems to be under pressure below USD 6,500. If BTC/USD continues to struggle to clear the USD 6,500 and USD 6,550 resistance, there could be a fresh downward move. Altcoins also remain at a risk of a downside break if they continue to face heavy selling interest.

0," Bitcoin price retested the USD 6,450 support area recently and later bounced back. However, the BTC/USD pair is still trading below the USD 6,500 resistance area with a bearish angle. The price made many lower highs and struggled to gain momentum for a break above the USD 6,500 and USD 6,550 resistance levels. Similarly, ethereum price is stuck in a tight range above the USD 200 support and it is struggling to surpass the USD 208 and USD 210 resistance levels.  Total market capitalization  Buyers defended the USD 6,450 support area in bitcoin price  once again. BTC/USD recovered and it is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) trading near the USD 6,475 level. On the upside, the most important resistance is at USD 6,500, above which the price could head towards the next key resistance at USD 6,550.
The current price action indicates that the price is trading in a tight range above the USD 6,400 and USD 6,450 support levels. If there is a break below USD 6,400, bitcoin could decline sharply in the near term. Ethereum price  found a strong buying interest near the USD 200 support once again. ETH/USD recovered a couple of points, but it is still struggling to clear the USD 205, USD 208 and USD 210 resistance levels.
On the other hand, if sellers manage to clear the USD 200 support, the price may perhaps come under a lot of selling pressure. The next support in the mentioned case could be USD 185. Bitcoin cash price  is stuck in a USD 20 range. BCH/USD is facing a solid resistance near the USD 450 - USD 460 zone, and on the downside, there is a major support near the USD 430 level. If the price settles above the USD 450 and USD 460 resistance levels, it could rise sharply towards the USD 500 level.
Ripple price  failed to clear the USD 0.470 resistance and started a downside move. The XRP/USD pair tested the USD 0.450 support and it is currently consolidating near USD 0.455 for the next move. Today, a few altcoins gained more than 8%, including RVN, MGO, ETP, VERI, STRAT and NEXO. Out of these, RVN rallied more than 15% and MGO was up roughly 13%. To sum up, bitcoin price remains confined in a tiny range above the USD 6,450 support. BTC/USD must break the USD 6,500 and USD 6,550 resistance levels. If buyers continue to fail, there is a risk of a sharp downside break towards the USD 6,200 level. Similarly, ethereum price could nosedive if it continues to fail near the USD 208 and USD 210 resistance levels.

1," If you wonder how Bitcoin mining would go, but can’t afford to start, there is now a simulator to show you how it works.  Made by Reddit user u/BTCGamer, the game lets you buy rigs, fans, research better ones, expand your space, etc. Published on Newgrounds, the online community for entertainment including gaming, filming, audio and artwork composition, the game has close to 50,000 views as of the time of writing. You start out with a small room that consists of six desks and 0.08 BTC. For now, you can only afford a desktop from Bell Computers that generates 0.01 BTC per minute and doesn’t use electricity. Once you make enough money, you can buy a 6 GPU Custom Mining Rig for 0.3 BTC and install it on the second table. It generates 0.3 BTC per minute and doesn’t use electricity either. Rigs can be overclocked (by making them ""run faster"" than originally intended), making them generate more BTC, but you can only overclock one rig. From then on, you keep the game open and wait until you generate enough bitcoins to “research” new miners to improve the amount of BTC earned per minute. Keep in mind that most of these do use electricity, though, and the cost will be automatically deducted from your in-game balance. All miners generate heat as well - how much depends on the rig itself. Overheating the room makes you lose the game, so invest in coolers as well! The visuals of the game are very rudimentary, and the music may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but it can be turned off. However, it is the product of a single person, so expectations should be low to begin with. The creator also takes everyone’s criticisms into account and adds features according to that. Although there is practically no replayability value, the game is a great insight into how mining works - and how boring it is most of the time. It has a score of 3.58 out of 5 on Newgrounds, and 179 people added it to their Faves. On social network Reddit, the game received pretty positive acclaim, where one user even mined more than 21 million - a significant amount of time spent in the game, at the very least. It’s no Witcher 3, GTA V or Skyrim, but for all of you who want to learn more about crypto mining, check it out!"
1," Bitcoin price tested the key USD 6,450 support area and later recovered. BTC/USD moved higher and traded above the USD 6,500 resistance, but gains were limited. Similarly, ethereum price recovered after dropping below the USD 200 support. It could continue to move higher in the short term towards the USD 208 and USD 210 resistances. Ripple performed well as it traded above the USD 0.450 and USD 0.460 resistance levels. Overall, the market sentiment slightly improved, but bitcoin is still trading well below the USD 6,550 and USD 6,600 barriers. Total market capitalization  There was a downside spike towards the USD 6,450 support in bitcoin price . BTC/USD found a strong buying interest near USD 6,450 and later started an upward move. It traded up by more than USD 50 and broke the USD 6,500 resistance. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 6,520, followed by USD 6,550.
On the downside, the price could decline towards the USD 6,480 level if it fails to hold the USD 6,500 support. Any further losses may perhaps push the price back towards the USD 6,450 support area. Ethereum price  slowly recovered and broke the USD 205 resistance. However, ETH/USD failed to gain momentum above USD 205 and the pair is currently consolidating near USD 204.
On the downside, an initial support is near the USD 202 level, followed by the key USD 200 support. To the topside, the price has to break the USD 208 and USD 210 levels to stage a decent rebound. Bitcoin cash price  remained in a range below the USD 450 resistance. BCH/USD seems to be facing a tough barrier around the USD 450  - USD 460 zone. On the downside, the USD 440 level is a decent support, below which the price may drop towards the USD 425 level.
Ripple price  gained momentum recently and traded up by around 2.8%. XRP/USD broke the USD 0.450 and USD 0.460 resistance levels to climb back into the positive zone. A few altcoins gained between 8%-20% today, including MGO, GVT, DROP, BCD, REP, NEXO, BTG and SC. Out of these, MGO gained around 17% and GVT traded up roughly 15.5%. Overall, bitcoin price bounced back after testing the USD 6,450 support. However, the price has to surpass the USD 6,550 and USD 6,600 resistance levels to start a solid upward move. Until then, BTC/USD and ETH/USD may well continue to trade in a range. On the flip side, a downside break below USD 6,400 could open the gates for more declines in the near term.

1," Cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity fast in Colombia – with developments coming apace in the field of commerce, education and overseas investment. Activity on LocalBitcoins, a peer-to-peer bitcoin marketplace, just reached new all-time heights with BTC 350 traded last week.  Meanwhile, the Dash cryptocurrency, which recently reported that it had signed up “more than 100 new Dash merchants in Colombia in the last three months,” this week announced that it was allocating some USD 300,000 worth of funds for growth projects in Colombia and neighboring Venezuela. Dash is thought to have a total of almost 29 communities in the two countries. Also, DiarioBitcoin reports that a large, newly formed community of Colombian cryptocurrency miners and blockchain companies named FEDE-MINERS wants to petition the government to deregulate mining and convince lawmakers to consider the financial and technological benefits of pro-blockchain policies. Although the Colombian government is currently mulling the introduction of crypto-specific taxes and regulations, while the country’s biggest exchange has been hit with a banking freeze-out, recently elected president Iván Duque Márquez, is known to be an avid fintech enthusiast, and has spoken favorably about cryptocurrency usage in the past. Moreover, the country’s biggest university, the National University of Colombia, has announced that it has begun a month-long “blockchain and cryptocurrencies” introductory course, which runs until late November this year, and is open to members of the general public. Also, as reported, the country’s biggest star, footballer James Rodriguez, has recently launched his own digital token, and domestic “unicorn” e-commerce platform Rappi, which has branches elsewhere in Latin America, recently announced it would begin accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment."
1," It all started with a tweet by Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk. i🖤anime — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 22, 2018  I know, you’re probably wondering, “what does this have to do with Bitcoin?” Let me get to that. After the anime tweet, a user asked the tech entrepreneur when two-factor authentication would be applied to Tesla accounts, and Musk responded with this tweet. Wanna buy some Bitcoin? 😉😉 pic.twitter.com/9ZbBJ5fuVq — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 22, 2018  Immediately after the tweet, Twitter locked Musk’s account after thinking his account was hacked. Twitter has been flooded with crypto related spam for well over a year now, but it seems Twitter is starting to have a semi grip on the spam—at least the crypto spam potentially coming from high profile accounts. Elon Musk has been impersonated by scammers in the past, who have made fake accounts of him offering fake crypto ‘giveaways.’ Binance’s founder even took notice and responded to Musk’s tweet and said: Lol, it's spreading. I will buy a Tesla if you accept crypto… https://t.co/IgdieNZA0H — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) October 23, 2018  The rest of the comments were a flood of crypto enthusiasts promoting the digital token they’re most passionate about or people who were utterly confused. >> How to Lose Money Quickly Crypto Day Trading Unfortunately, Musk wasn’t actually endorsing or taking a stance on the digital currency but was simply making fun of it. That is correct — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 23, 2018  Bummer; the tech entrepreneur would be a huge contribution to the cryptocurrency space, despite his recent meltdowns. Musk has had a heck of a year this year. First, Tesla Model 3 production hit many snags, as the car model took longer to manufacture than previously anticipated. Investors started growing anxious wanting their car. Musk is also CEO of SpaceX and has been launching many rockets into space on a monthly basis in 2018, and he is CEO of the Boring Company, which is working on an underground trial tunnel under SpaceX’s headquarters to fix Los Angeles’ traffic problem. Currently, Mr. Musk is being investigated by the SEC for potential fraud. To say it’s been a bad year for him is probably the understatement of the year. While Musk may not be on the crypto train just yet—there’s still hope. Featured Image: wikimedia.org"
1," Bitcoin price remained confined in a tiny range above the USD 6,400 support area. BTC/USD seems to be struggling to clear the USD 6,500 and USD 6,550 resistance levels. Similarly, ethereum price is holding the USD 200 support, but it is facing a lot of offers near the USD 208 and USD 210 levels. Other major altcoins like bitcoin cash and ripple also faced an increased selling pressure as they declined below key supports. Going forward, there could be more range moves in the crypto market before the next major move. Total market capitalization  Buyers struggled to gain momentum, resulting in a few bearish moves in bitcoin price  below the USD 6,500 support. BTC/USD settled below the USD 6,500 support level, which is now acting as a resistance. Above this, the next major hurdle for buyers is near the USD 6,550 level. To move into a positive zone, the price has to surpass the USD 6,600 resistance.
On the downside, an initial support is near the USD 6,450 level, below which the price may decline towards the USD 6,400 support area. Any further losses will most likely put sellers in full control in the short term. Ethereum price  tested the USD 200 support area and it is currently consolidating losses. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the USD 208 level, above which the key resistance is at USD 215.
On the flip side, if sellers push the price below the USD 200 support, then there could be a sharp sell-off in ETH/USD. In the mentioned case, the price may possibly test the USD 185 level. Bitcoin cash price  attempted a recovery above the USD 450 level, but it failed to gain bullish momentum. BCH/USD declined and traded below the USD 450 support. The next key support is at USD 440, below which the price may decline to USD 425.
Ripple price  failed to hold gains above the main USD 0.450 support. XRP/USD is currently down around 1% and it is likely heading towards the USD 0.440 support area. On the upside, resistances are at USD 0.452 and USD 0.460. A few altcoins rallied today by more than 1%, including LINK, DCR, POLY and MOAC. Out of these, LINK gained around 26% and DCR was up around 25%. Overall, bitcoin price is slowly moving lower towards the USD 6,400 support area, which holds the key in the near term. To recover, the price must settle above the USD 6,550 level and then clear USD 6,600. If not, there is a risk of more declines in BTC/USD and altcoins in the coming sessions.

1," Two significant news rocked the crypto world: first, major cryptocurrency exchange Binance just received an investment from the Singaporean government, and second, new Bitcoin futures are set to hit the market in December. Binance has received an undisclosed amount from Vertex Ventures, the venture capital arm of government-owned investment company Temasek Holdings Pte from Singapore. The investment is set to boost Binance’s plans to allow users of their platform to trade crypto for the Singaporean dollar and vice versa. The platform only recently started testing fiat to crypto transactions in Uganda, as they opened a chapter of their company there. Meanwhile, Bakkt, a heavyweight crypto platform launched by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, will start clearing Bitcoin futures on December 12th. According to the ICE-issued document revealing the details of these news, the “physical” Bitcoin backing the futures contract will be held in a so-called “digital asset warehouse” that was created by Bakkt and ICE in a collaborative effort. As pointed out by Joseph Young, a cryptocurrency reporter and analyst, Bakkt’s upcoming arrival could likely catalyze thousands of traders to invest in this space and may even persuade the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to reconsider their position on this market.  It will For those who don’t see what the big deal about institutional investors’ support for crypto is, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, offered an explanation. He asked on Twitter, “What happens when a fund like Fidelity allocates a mere 5 percent of their portfolio to crypto?  Have you calculated how much that is?”  He further explains:  Right, that little 5% is more than doubling (almost tripple) the entire crypto market cap. And some people are still worried about... pic.twitter.com/EETSyQXjnm As reported in October, the fourth largest asset manager with USD 7.2 trillion in assets under management, the US-based Fidelity Investments has announced that it is launching a new company aimed at financial institutions that want to trade and store digital assets."
1," The volatility of the bitcoin price is now nearly as low as shares of tech giant Apple, the world’s biggest company by market capitalization,  according to new data released by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).  As most traders are aware, the stock market has generally been considered far less volatile, and less risky, than the crypto market. However, this belief is now being put into question as a result of unusually stable prices for the number one cryptocurrency. The CBOE data showed that bitcoin’s 20-day historical volatility has fallen to 31.5%, lower than that of well-established publicly traded companies like Amazon, an e-commerce giant, and Netflix.  20-day Historical Volatility “A one standard deviation move for bitcoin is about USD 475. That works out to +/- 7.3% […],” Kevin Davitt, a senior instructor for the Options Institute at CBOE, was quoted as saying by Marketwatch. According to him, in mid-January, “the standard deviation measured $4,640 or +/- 42%.” A standard deviation in a market is a measure of how often a certain move in prices can be expected to occur on average. Following a normal distribution, 68% of all moves are within +/- 1 standard deviation. Although low volatility represents a challenge for active traders, long-term holders and bitcoin enthusiasts see it as a positive development for the digital asset, bringing it closer to the vision of it becoming “digital gold.” “Perhaps we are witnessing the maturation of a market. It’s far too early to declare this the ‘new normal’ but the persistent range over the last few weeks may be hinting at a structural shift,” CBOE’s Davitt concluded. Other experts have also suggested that the recently low volatility of the bitcoin market could be a sign that the market is maturing. Earlier this month, Gil Luria, research director at wealth management firm D.A. Davidson & Co., hinted that there is less speculation in the bitcoin economy today. “When speculators are involved, they drive unusually high volumes as well as volatility by trading the asset with high frequency. As speculator involvement is diminished, volumes go down and volatility goes down as well,” Luria said at the time."
1," As November is approaching and Bitcoin price is stuck in a crucial range, the cryptoverse is increasingly debating what will the next month bring this time. Tom Lee, Wall Street market analyst and Bitcoin bull, remains convinced that Bitcoin could still surpass USD 20,000 - even in spite of the year-long bear market. In an interview with Heidi “BlockchainChick,” a crypto influencer, he said that “people are too bearish” and that there is still time for his prediction to come true. The head of Fundstrat Global Advisors, a market analyst company, explained: “What happens is, people get bearish because it makes sense. I mean, market’s been terrible and we’re below 200-day [moving average] and we [at Fundstrat] published a report this week that pointed out to our clients that when Bitcoin is under its 200-day, it only goes up 50% of the time in the next six months. But when it’s above its 200-day, it is up 80% of the time, so the trend implied by the 200-day is obviously very important.” He still stands by his USD 20,000 prophecy: according to Fundstrat’s research, by year’s end, the break-even cost of mining bitcoin will rise to USD 8,000 - USD 9,000. According to the analyst, bitcoin often trades at over two times its break-even - and sometimes even three to four times the number - so Lee doesn’t consider his price prediction all that bullish in the first place. However, there is still a big question in the air: what’s the bottom? “Until people are convinced that there’s a bottom, like there are a chicken and an egg, you can’t motivate people until the [bottoming] event happens,” he adds. A recent informal poll by Fundstrat indicated that the usually very cautious Wall Street investors are now overwhelmingly calling a bottom in the bitcoin market. Twitter users, however, are still skeptical, with a majority saying bitcoin still has room to fall. Meanwhile, Lee is not the only one who believes the end of the year could bring respite from the market red. The cryptocurrency community on Reddit, a social network site, had one user reappropriate a quote from Benjamin Franklin: “In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes,” and u/ideaDash adds, “Crypto November.” There are those who believe that Bakkt could turn the market bullish, while others maintain that Novembers in previous years constitute no guarantee for a bull run.  The community forgets a single truth, however, spoken in 1991 by Guns N’ Roses: “Nothin' lasts forever / And we both know hearts can change / And it's hard to hold a candle / In the cold November rain.” Maybe Axl didn’t originally mean a crypto candle, but possibly he’s revised his opinion by now.

1," A new chart from the quantitative cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo sheds light on some of the developments seen in the bitcoin market this year, with network activity increasing even as bitcoin prices have plummeted. However, not everyone agrees with the analyst.  In the chart, posted to Twitter on Friday, Willy Woo showed that the Bitcoin blockchain blocks reached 95% of capacity last week. Meanwhile no noticeable change has been recorded in the transaction fees required to successfully make a payment on the network. As of Monday morning, average transaction fees on the Bitcoin network stood at around USD 0.36, per data from blockchain analytics company Blockchain. Meanwhile... during the bear market no less... Bitcoin's blocks peak above 95% full without anyone noticing, the fees and confirm times remain nominal. Bitcoin of 2018 is not Bitcoin of 2017. The protocol is quietly improving. pic.twitter.com/ZgtpBnQFbJ The chart from Woo supposedly illustrates that despite higher levels of network congestion today compared to last year, transaction fees today remain normal and well under the levels from last year. However, other cryptocurrency experts such as Alan Silbert, executive managing director at INX Limited, an owner and operator of a platform for trading blockchain assets and their derivatives, and Adam Back, founder and CEO of Blockstream, a blockchain startup, have something to add: Good point, and also because of the weighting the backwards compatible serialisation of base blocks (removing the signatures for old nodes) will never reach 1MB so it becomes artificial. even though the full block is 2.2MB -- because the weighting rule is that body + sig/4 < 1MB. At the time of writing, the discussion between the three is not over yet. Meanwhile, some other members of the cryptoverse have also shared their opinions on the matter: It's obvious what happens. As tx volume increases it will bump into the limit leading to a supply constraint, spike in the mempool, and increased fees. _____ Check your math/logic.  Last bull run block usage went up about 25% (800K-->1M). But capacity is now 100% to 200% higher than before.  So there will be no delays and fees will not go up much, if at all. No matter who is right, Bitcoin still lags far behind traditional alternatives like Visa or MasterCard in terms of the number of transactions per second (TPS) it can handle.  With current capacity, the Bitcoin network is able to process about 7 TPS. That compares to Visa’s payments network, which is able to handle more than 24,000 TPS. As Pantera Capital’s co-CIO Joey Krug reiterated in an interview last week, the cryptocurrencies of today can be compared to “the Internet before dial-up,” where they are not scalable. He went on to say that this is the first thing that needs to be solved in order for cryptocurrencies to enter the next bull phase and gain mainstream adoption."
1," A court in Russia has ordered an Evangelical church to pay a bill of USD 16,000 for mining cryptocurrencies. In a civil case, the Court of Arbitration in Irkutsk ruled in favor of local energy provider Irkutskenegro, who had alleged that the church, Grace, began using an inordinately high quantity of electricity in May 2017 – and had billed the religious group accordingly. Energy is highly subsidized in Russia, and Irkutsk residents enjoy some of the lowest power prices on the planet. However, energy providers only offer subsidized rates to residential and non-industrial users. Illicit miners, say providers in the country, can be charged retrospectively with industrial rates. Per Interfax and FTimes, Grace had disputed the provider’s charge, and denied that it was using electricity for Bitcoin mining – instead claiming that in May last year, the church had installed several printers to “produce religious literature.” However, the court heard that local printers in fact used just a small fraction of the energy Grace had used in the same period. Irkutskenegro stated that the church had consumed a whopping 2 million kW/h in May to August 2017. This is not the only surprising instance of an unauthorized cryptocurrency mining in Russia. On February 9, 2018, scientists at a Russian nuclear center were arrested for the offense of using resources at the center to mine cryptocurrencies.  Also, the case bears similarities to that of a Cherepovets resident who was found to have kitted out an otherwise-empty apartment with mining rigs – and was later ordered to pay similar charges. Meanwhile, Russian parliamentarians have appeared to backtrack on plans to include a definition of cryptocurrency mining in a long-awaited package of crypto-specific legislation. As previously reported, the head of the committee overseeing the bills earlier this month stated that cryptocurrency mining would be defined so that miners could be taxed, although “cryptocurrency” and similar terms would not be given legal definition. The move led to major criticism from fintech, law and IT experts in the country. Per Interfax, the committee now says it plans to remove all mention of crypto mining from the bills to avoid mentioning cryptocurrencies at all – although the government still plans to tax crypto miners for their “entrepreneurial activities.” Critics in the country have argued that this latest decision simply muddies the issue yet further. The bills have already passed their first hearing, and were slated to have been given a second and final reading by the end of October – a deadline that it seems lawmakers will now struggle to meet."
1," The Intercontinental Exchange’s upcoming cryptocurrency trading platform Bakkt will officially launch on December 12, pending regulatory approval. ICE announced Monday that Bakkt could begin offering physically settled bitcoin futures contracts in December, marking the first cryptocurrency-related offering provided through the new platform. Bakkt will hold the bitcoins backing the futures contract in the ICE Digital Asset Warehouse, according to the notice, provided the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) signs off. These futures contracts will be cleared through ICE Clear US, another subsidiary of the exchange, which notably owns the New York Stock Exchange. “Each futures contract calls for delivery of one bitcoin held in the Bakkt Digital Asset Warehouse, and will trade in U.S. dollar terms. One daily contract will be listed for trading each Exchange Business Day,” the announcement read. Bakkt was first announced earlier this year, when ICE announced its intention to develop “an open and regulated, global ecosystem for digital assets.” At the time, the exchange also noted it would offer a one-day bitcoin futures contract, meaning clients can cash their futures products out to receive bitcoin, rather than cash. The exchange was initially expected to launch in November, pending approval by the CFTC. No reason was immediately given for the delay through December. Bitcoin image via Shutterstock"
0," The deadline for filing a rehabilitation claim with the infamous Mt. Gox exchange is rapidly approaching; claimants have until Monday, October 22nd to send proof of being a victim in the exchange’s hack.  Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee of the exchange opened up the process in August as part of its civil rehabilitation process. A separate Q&A document, published in August, says that, “The planned deadline for the Rehabilitation Trustee to submit a statement of approval or rejection to the court is January 24, 2019, but, at the current point in time, a definite date has not been determined.” There has been no update on this situation as of right now. However, according to a Reddit post on the topic, during a Q&A session of the creditors meeting on September 26th Kobayashi confirmed that he is going ahead with self-admission of claims. These so-called zombie claims mean that if the trustee is aware of anyone who should have a claim, he will file a claim on their behalf. In other words, anyone that had an account on Mt. Gox and appears on their database, even with just a few dollars or satoshis on the exchange, will have a claim filed in their name. However, if the funds are unclaimed after a certain amount of time, it will pass to the Japanese treasury. According to reports, there are about 75.000 small accounts that make up about 10% to 20% of total claim value. ""In practice this means a reduction of claim value for BTC claimants, and the Japanese government benefiting. Our group (mtgoxlegal.com) are currently fundraising to keep our lawyer on this,"" the post reads. However, there is no official announcement regarding the ""zombie claims."" The road to recovery has not been completely smooth to all claimants, however. In a subreddit dedicated to the legal proceedings of Mt. Gox, many users complain that the call center is hard to reach, even during business hours, and that the process itself is confusing.  The community also speculates that the payout should happen around summer to fall 2019. Reddit user u/Btc_Hawker said they were attending the previous creditors’ meeting on September 26th, and writes, “[I] will be asking the trustee to pay out an interim distribution of all the cash owed to depositors and the vast bulk of the Bitcoin in February. There is no justification for further delay once civil rehabilitation is approved.” The user did not further update on this. The next Mt. Gox creditors’ meeting is set for March 20th, 2019. Before that, the period to examine Proofs of rehabilitation claims is set from January 31st to February 7th, 2019.  Launched in July 2010, by 2013 and into 2014 Mt. Gox was handling over 70% of all bitcoin transactions worldwide, as the largest bitcoin intermediary and the world's leading bitcoin exchange, according to Wikipedia. Mt. Gox announced that approximately 850,000 bitcoins belonging to customers and the company were missing and likely stolen, an amount valued at more than USD 450 million at the time."
0," Bitcoin price started a downward move yesterday from the USD 6,600 resistance level. BTC/USD declined below the USD 6,550 level and later broke the USD 6,500 support to move into a short term bearish zone. Similarly, ethereum price failed to stay above the USD 205 support and it seems like the USD 200 support is currently (UTC 08:00 AM) at risk. The current price action is indicating an increase in selling pressure on bitcoin and altcoins, which may result in additional weakness in the next two sessions. Total market capitalization  There was no recovery above the USD 6,600 resistance in bitcoin price . BTC/USD started a fresh decline and broke the key USD 6,500 support. It tested the USD 6,450 support, but it seems like there are possibilities of more losses.
The next major support on the downside is at USD 6,400, below which bitcoin buyers may come under a lot of pressure. On the upside, the previous support at USD 6,500 is now a major resistance. Above USD 6,500, the main hurdle for buyers to take control is at USD 6,600. Ethereum price  also declined further and broke the USD 205 support. ETH/USD traded close to the USD 200 support and it is currently consolidating losses.
If the price settles below the USD 200 support, there could be heavy declines towards the USD 180 level in the near term. On the upside, the USD 205 and USD 210 levels are important resistances for buyers. Bitcoin cash price  extended losses and broke the USD 440 support. BCH/USD even tested the USD 425 support and it is currently down more than 3.5%. To recover, the price has to move above the USD 440 and USD 450 resistance levels. If not, sellers could push the price towards the USD 400 handle.
Ripple price  also followed bitcoin this time and traded below the USD 0.465 and USD 0.460 support levels. XRP/USD may continue to move down towards the next key support at USD 0.435. Despite the recent bearish moves in bitcoin, two altcoins, POLY and ELF traded higher and posted gains more than 10%. On the other hand, many coins like PIVX, NANO, ARK, ETP and MOAC declined between 6%-12% To sum up, it seems like bitcoin price failed to hold this week’s gains above USD 6,700. BTC/USD may continue to move down, but buyers are likely to take a stand near the USD 6,400 support. Similarly, ETH/USD could find a strong buying interest near the USD 195 - USD 200 zone.

0," The Armenian government has presided over the opening of what it claims is one of the biggest cryptocurrency mining farms in the world. At a ceremony in the capital, Yerevan, acting Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan was joined by the head of the consortium that has constructed the farm, Armenian billionaire (and so-called oligarch) Gagik Tsarukyan. Per news outlet Yerkramas, Tsarukyan claims that the farm, which is the brainchild of his Multi Group conglomerate, cost some USD 50 million to construct, and has been equipped with an initial 3,000 mining rigs. The company is planning to expand that number to 12,000 in the near future. The farm will initially mine Bitcoin and Ethereum. Yerkramas states that the facility is based on two floors: the ground floor is a business and management center, with an entire floor given over to servers and equipment above. The media outlet says that Tsarukyan and Pashinyan – who tendered his resignation from his post two days ago in a bid to call snap elections – were joined by business leaders from China, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates and “a number of other countries” for the opening ceremony. Tsarukyan is quoted as saying, “Guests are coming to Armenia from almost 40 countries [to see the mine]. This is an important step towards the development of the information technology sector in Armenia, especially since representatives of foreign business circles are planning to meet with members of the government to discover more about the possibilities of making new, larger investments in the Armenian economy.” The farm will initially receive some 50MW of power from a thermal energy plant, with “an agreement in place” to provide an increase in capacity to 200MW, per Armenpress. Watch this video from the opening of the farm: Earlier this year, the country’s government legalized mining in anticipation of the farm’s opening, although cryptocurrency trading remains illegal in Armenia. The country says it is planning to create a Free Economic Zone for overseas crypto and blockchain companies – in the vein of Belarus’ Hi-Tech Park and Kazakhstan’s Astana International Financial Center."
0," The crypto industry just used an old way to reach masses: invite a TV star, make a funny video and hope it will go viral. And this time it really did went viral, spreading the word about the world of cryptocurrencies: almost 2.5 million views on YouTube and Twitter in less than two days. eToro, a multi-asset platform which offers both investing in stocks and cryptocurrencies, released an ad featuring actor Kristian Nairn, better known as the character Hodor from the record-breaking TV series Game of Thrones.  Kristian Nairn portrays the beloved character Hodor, the simple-minded servant of a noble house in the TV show Game of Thrones, who can only say the word Hodor which, in turn, gave him the name. The character spends a significant amount of time carrying a young boy on his back in the show, communicating only with that one word, which is derived from the phrase ""hold the door"".  The ad follows the actor listening to offers for advertisements in which he always carries something on his back and says “Hodor.” Tired of being pigeonholed, he tells his agent to find him something “with a tie”. Well, the result is below: The community went absolutely wild over the advertisement. Nairn’s character was universally beloved - the episode featuring a significant plot twist involving Hodor’s past and future which brought fans to tears has been universally acclaimed as well as receiving a 100% rating from review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. The choice of character, the play on words and the simple message of the ad had fans in a frenzy. “Thanks @eToro for proving that advertisements can be funny again,” writes Twitter user @FleitzPierre, while user @CryptoPoland adds, “A serious actor who reminds us the ads can be more engaging, funny and enjoyable, all at the same time.” Other people are finding more easter eggs in the ad: “Anyone else notice the elevator buttons? Moon or Rekt,” writes Reddit user u/jaynemesis. Then, there are those speculating on other characters of the show and the ways they’re leveraging the world’s economy to serve their own goals… But that does not really have much to do with Hodor. The platform might well have struck gold with this ad in terms of the future of crypto advertising: integrating terms unique to the cryptoverse into pop culture could serve to familiarize wider audiences with the industry. After all, are you a real Game of Thrones fan if there is a reference somewhere online that you don’t understand?"
0," A murder in Norway, even if it’s not related to a bitcoin trade that took place before the killing happened, comes as a reminder to be extra careful when buying or selling bitcoin in person.   A 24-year-old man who was found dead in his apartment in Oslo, Norway on Monday morning, had earlier sold bitcoins to another person for cash, according to Norwegian broadcaster TV2.  The victim reportedly brought the large sum of money back to his apartment, where he was later found stabbed to death. It is unclear exactly when the bitcoin trade took place. “We are aware of a tip relating to bitcoin, but we do not wish to elaborate on it at this stage of the investigation,” Grete Lien Metlid, head of the intelligence and investigations unit at the Oslo Police Department, told TV2. According to sources who spoke with TV2, several of the victim’s friends were aware that he stored a large amount of money in cash in his apartment, located in one of Oslo’s best neighbourhoods, after the bitcoin sale. After failing to show up for work Monday morning, the victim was found dead by one of his roommates at 12:15 the same day. Before that, he was last seen on Sunday night as everyone who lived in the apartment were preparing to go to sleep. It remains a mystery how the murderer got into the apartment and carried out the crime without waking up any of the other roommates. As of press time, forensic analysts were still working on the crime scene. No arrests have yet been made in the case, nor does the police have any suspects. Since the beginning of the year, there was a number of violent attacks on individuals who hold a substantial amount of cryptocurrency. No matter where you are in the world, if you have a substantial holding in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, it is important to be aware of the potential security concerns that can arise from your newfound crypto wealth. Now, before you go and buy yourself a gun or install the latest security system in your home, you should know that there are cheaper and perhaps more sensible precautions that you can take."
0," Trading in bitcoin futures contracts continue to gain popularity among speculators in the US futures market, according to recently released figures from futures marketplace CME Group.   During the third quarter this year, the exchange saw an average daily trading volume of 5,053 bitcoin futures contracts. On CME’s market, each bitcoin contract represents 5 bitcoins, which means that contracts worth a total of 25,265 BTC (USD 163 million) changed hands every trading day. Trading volume rose by 41% since last quarter, in what has been a fairly constant rate of increase since bitcoin futures were first introduced on the CME exchange in December 2017. In Q3, Bitcoin futures average daily volume rose 41% and open interest was up 19% over Q2 . Learn how market participants are using BTC to manage risk in changing markets. https://t.co/Yt41SzsHku pic.twitter.com/Kw4OX0QaKT Meanwhile, so-called open interest, meaning the amount of new money that is flowing into the market, also increased by 19% since the last quarter. Generally, increasing open interest is seen as a sign that market participants are taking a greater interest in a market, strengthening the already existing price movements.  In the case of the bitcoin market, this could mean that the current “range-bound” pattern in the market is being reinforced by trading taking place in the futures market. The introduction of bitcoin futures trading on CME Group’s exchange on December 17, 2017 coincided with the peak in bitcoin prices last year, when bitcoin hit nearly USD 20,000 on several cryptocurrency exchanges. Trading on CME’s market followed the launch of the first-ever bitcoin futures market on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) one week earlier.  However, futures were blamed for Bitcoin’s fall from its peak.  “The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence. It is consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the introduction of futures markets for an asset,” according to research from the San Francisco Federal Reserve."
0," According to sources, on October 16th, a Bitcoin user managed to transfer 29,999 BTC with a transaction fee of only $0.10. This amount of Bitcoin equates to $194 million, and a transaction of this magnitude would usually incur bank fees in the tens of thousands of dollars. With such a small Bitcoin fee for such a large transaction, will we see widespread adoption for big over-sea payments? Bitcoin transactions are a funny one. Often, complaints roll in by the dozen about the cost of transaction fees because to clear a transaction on such a high-volume network means paying for expensive miners. But this transaction shows the potential of the Bitcoin blockchain to perform cross-border payments cost-efficiently and effectively. Claims have risen before about transactions on the Bitcoin network costing $60. As recently as October 14th, cryptocurrency critic Nouriel Roubini, economist and professor at Stern School, made such a statement. However, his claim was met with fire: “BTC fees are less than $0.10, easily verifiable. If you value truth, you’d provide a public correction.” So if this transaction did indeed only cost the sender a small Bitcoin fee of $0.10, then it throws regular banks into chaos. >> Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum Foundation Hands Out Over $3 Million in Awards To put it in perspective, the cheapest platforms available to transfer fiat currency abroad still ask for a percentage of the cost, and that percentage is far greater than $0.10. For example, on a platform like Transferwise, to send over $1 million, it costs over $7,500 in transaction fees. Percentage-wise, this figure is less than 1% of $1 million, so $7,500 is considered cheap for a transfer that large. However, using the Bitcoin network at $0.10 for the same transaction is astronomically (and literally) cheaper than $7,500! The biggest issue with the Bitcoin network and transactions has been scalability. But this is an issue that is being resolved. Bitcoin’s Lightning network is offering the ability of on-chain and second-layer solutions. This means the network, in effect, can process small payments faster. But at the scale of $194 million, massive firms and investors will no doubt prefer the Bitcoin network for over-seas trading, would they not? Why would you want to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in bank fees when you can pay a small Bitcoin fee of 10 cents only? I know what I’d choose. What about you?

0," Increased scalability of cryptocurrencies is needed before the next run-up in prices, but when that happens the market to increase “10x from here”,  according to Joey Krug, Pantera Capital’s co-chief investment officer. In an interview with Bloomberg he also said that the market has already hit its bottom this year. Krug further compared the most recent bull market to the current market, saying that news about early adoption by some institutions sparked a surge in speculative investments two years ago. This time around, however, he believes the market is waiting for more “actual adoption” of digital assets, and decentralized applications (dapps) in particular. He went on to compare the current state of dapps to “the Internet before dial-up,” where they are not scalable, and people are not using them for that reason, hinting that this is the first thing that needs to be solved. Although Joey Krug and Pantera Capital, a crypto investment firm and hedge fund, remain very optimistic about crypto over the long-term, Krug did warn that prices could continue in their current “range-bound” pattern for a while.  When asked if it is right that he doesn’t believe the market will rebound for the next two years until scalability is solved, Krug answered that “we could see a rebound before then, but I think that’s gonna be the real catalyst that drives the next huge bull-run in my opinion.” In August, Pantera announced that it is looking to raise up to USD 175 million for its third venture fund. This is a significant jump from its previous ones, as their second one was USD 25 million, whereas its debut deployed USD 13 million back in 2013. However, Pantera Capital’s Digital Asset Fund was still showing loss in August.   Pantera releases some painful performance numbers for their new #crypto fund. #bitcoin #ethereum pic.twitter.com/Do6D8sxHla In the meantime, new solutions that help Bitcoin to scale are being launched. Recently, San Francisco startup Blockstream launched the Liquid Network, a Bitcoin sidechain, which marks ""the beginning of a new era of digital asset issuance and transacting by enabling the tokenization of fiat, gold, securities, and even other new crypto assets – all with Bitcoin at the center."" The sidechain has become another important development for Bitcoin alongside the Lightning Network. In comparison, while the Liquid sidechain is purpose-built to cater for the needs of exchanges, brokers and traders, the the Lightning Network is designed to enable the near-instant transfer of small or micro value payments between linked channel members and merchants.

0," German Bitcoin enthusiast Matthias Steinig has created an e-bike that accepts payments through Lightning Network. The bike is a pretty standard model, with an electronic conversion kit retrofitted. The battery for the e-bike powers a Raspberry Pi controller with an e-Ink display to keep power consumption low - as the creator says that the biggest drain on power is the USB modem/network card necessary for Lightning communication. Both on his GitHub, a software development platform, and in a tweeted video, Steinig explains how to use the bike: “You select on the display how long you want to drive, get a QR code that you scan and pay for with your Lightning mobile app, after that the power for the selected period is turned on. The special about this system, it's mobile, the communication is realized via the mobile network and the power comes from the battery of the e-bike.” The video in his tweet shows the practical side of this. The bike charges 250 satoshis (BTC 0.00000250 or USD 0.016) per minute, and once the QR code is generated, you have 60 seconds to pay using your Lightning app. Once the payment is made, the system powers on and you’re free to ride around for the selected time. As Steinig explains, “After the end of the paid time, the system switches off and the power supply is interrupted - of course you can continue driving, but only with muscle power.” Hey, here's the promised video of using the lightning-bike, hope you like it! pic.twitter.com/ul2gBXc2id While the community likes the innovation, it would be a surprise if people didn’t crack a few jokes on the topic. “Looks on-chain to me,” says Reddit user u/kattbilder. “Proof of cables,” tweeted user @milancheck. Others point out that this is still very much only Proof of Concept: for example, the controller only limits access to the e-bike functionality. At the end of your time period, or indeed without using the Lightning Network payment system at all, you can still ride off with the bike using pedal power. Still, there are those that see the silver lining. As Twitter user @barryhackamac says, “Would be so nice to use this as a tourist and not have to set up some locally specific app with foreign exchange commissions etc.” User @daggeroflight11 tweets, “It’s things like this that will bring mass adoption. Not ETFs. Not Wall Street. Smart motivated people finding use cases and running with them. Great work!” Meanwhile, smart and motivated people are building other great things that might help cryptocurrency adoption. For example, in September, a group of developers have completed the first off-grid cryptocurrency transaction using blockchain and shortwave radios as well as solar power. In other words, they have found a way to send crypto in times of disasters."
0," After a massive rally yesterday, bitcoin price retreated from well above USD 6,800 and traded below the USD 6,700 and USD 6,600 support levels. However, BTC/USD found support near the USD 6,500 zone and is currently consolidating near the USD 6,600 level. Similarly, ethereum price declined sharply and tested the USD 205 support. Other altcoins like ripple and bitcoin cash price are trading above key support levels and they could slowly grind higher in the near term. Total market capitalization  After a downside correction, bitcoin price  found a strong buying interest near the USD 6,550 level. BTC/USD recovered above the USD 6,600 level and it is currently struggling to clear the USD 6,640 resistance. Above this, the next major hurdle for buyers is near the USD 6,700 level.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 6,550, below which the price could test the USD 6,500 support. In case there are more declines, the price will most likely revisit the USD 6,400 support, which is a strong barrier for sellers. Ethereum price  trimmed most gains and declined below the USD 215 support. ETH/USD tested the next key support at USD 205, which prevented further slides.
The price is currently consolidating with an immediate resistance at USD 210. Above this, the price may well test the USD 215 resistance. On the downside, the USD 205 and USD 200 levels are important supports for buyers. Bitcoin cash price  is currently trading above the USD 450 support with a bullish angle. However, BCH/USD seems to be struggling to clear the USD 470 and USD 480 resistances. If there is a bearish reaction, the price could break the USD 450 support. The next key support is positioned at USD 430.
Ripple price  traded with a positive bias above the USD 0.450 level. XRP/USD is positioned nicely above the USD 0.450 and USD 0.440 supports, and it seems like the price is likely to accelerate above the USD 0.465 resistance in the near term. A few altcoins traded higher recently, including AOA, DGD, BCN, XTZ, ICX, KNC and HOT. Out of these aurora (AOA) rallied more than 20% and DGD gained around 17%. Overall, bitcoin price is still holding the key support at USD 6,400, which is a positive sign. Therefore, as long as BTC/USD is above USD 6,500 and USD 6,400, there are high possibilities of a fresh upward move towards USD 6,700 or USD 6,800 in the coming sessions. Similarly, ETH/USD could rise towards USD 215 or USD 220 as long as it is above the USD 200 support.

0," The nascent market of cryptocurrencies just received even more news to think about.  After reports that the major player in the crypto industry Coinbase failed to predict demand from large investors, and banking giant Barclays reportedly halted work on a cryptocurrency trading project, the market has received two positive news.  The fourth largest asset manager with USD 7.2 trillion in assets under management, the US-based Fidelity Investments has announced that it is launching a new company aimed at financial institutions that want to trade and store digital assets. Meanwhile in Japan, the world’s first public offering of a crypto-focused investment fund is set to go live.  The new company, dubbed Fidelity Digital Assets, will offer much-needed institutional custody services in “offline, vaulted deep-cold storage,” which could be just what many some of the bigger players on Wall Street have been waiting for before taking the leap into crypto, and offering it as a mainstream asset class to their clients. ""<..>Fidelity was seeing a steady increase in calls from large financial institutions regarding the company’s plans for handling digital assets, specifically with respect to custody and executional services,” the company said in a blog post, adding that “Institutional interest in digital assets is expanding, and these organizations require sophisticated capabilities in order to proceed.” According to former Wall Street banker-turned crypto entrepreneur Mike Novogratz, Fidelity Digital Assets will work with his company Galaxy Digital as its “alpha crypto custody client” going forward: Exciting news.  We are thrilled to  announce #GalaxyDigital as @Fidelity @DigitalAssets’ alpha crypto custody client #theherdiscoming https://t.co/87yeysYSFM Fidelity, which has over 70 years of experience in the financial services industry, will provide custody solutions to large trading firms that operates in the huge over-the-counter (OTC) market for cryptocurrencies. Fidelity Digital Assets reportedly has a staff of 100 people, and is led by Tom Jessop, a former Goldman Sachs managing director and president at tech startup Chain.  “Someone like Fidelity coming into this market we think will have a positive effect on the whole market,” Jessop was quoted as saying in a media statement.
____ Tom Jessop sits down with Bloomberg's Erik Schatzker to discuss Fidelity's new business to manage digital assets for hedge funds, family offices and trading firms: Arianna Simpson, managing director at crypto-focused venture capital fund Autonomous Partners, reacted to news: The Fidelity news is huge. Don’t you see what is happening?! What an extraordinary moment in time. Back in June, several media outlets reported that Fidelity was secretly working on setting up its own cryptocurrency exchange, largely based on reports that the veteran financial firm was actively hiring engineers for its new project. The job posting reportedly read that the engineers would be needed “to help engineer, create and deploy a Digital Asset exchange to both a public and private cloud.” Subscriptions for the new retail-oriented fund, dubbed Epoch Digital Assets, were opened on October 15, and are to be capped at 100 billion yen, or about USD 900 million, per a press release from the company. It claims that it's world's first public offering of a cryptocurrency and digital assets related fund. The new fund will reportedly operate in a hedge fund-like manner, investing in other funds, initial coin offerings (ICOs), and directly in digital assets, in an effort to smooth out the wild swings that the crypto market is known for, while still aiming to reap the rewards.  “We were very keen to undertake the world's first public offering of a cryptocurrency fund in Japan and look forward to great things ahead […] In the future, digital assets are likely to become an integrated part of investment portfolios, similar to equities and fixed income products today, albeit on a smaller scale,” Epoch partner James Skinner said in a statement. Meanwhile, in a separate announcement, heavyweight crypto platform Bakkt said that its exchange and clearing house boards — and the clearing house risk committee — ”have all reviewed and approved the respective rules” and will file these rules publicly with the the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for review and comment “very soon.”  “We’re taking a transparent approach to engage across the industry as we begin testing and onboarding in November, and trading and warehousing in December, subject to CFTC approval,” Kelly Loeffler, CEO of Bakkt, said."
0," Following the strong run-up in bitcoin prices yesterday, traders may now be eyeing another opportunity for further growth as the short trade is getting unusually crowded for the number one cryptocurrency.  In what appears to be short-term traders positioning themselves for a further sell-off in bitcoin on the Bitfinex exchange, the ratio of short-to-long orders on the exchange reached 1.54 during the Asian trading session Tuesday morning, a level not seen since November last year. Short-selling essentially involves speculating on lower prices in a market by borrowing an asset that a trader doesn’t currently own in order to sell it in the market. The asset can then be bought back at a lower price later, allowing the short-seller to profit from the difference between the selling price and the buying price. While a high number of sellers in a market is generally considered a bad sign, it also opens up opportunities when it reaches extreme levels. This is what is known as a short-squeeze, and it is something we have seen repeatedly this year as the short-to-long ratio has hit the high levels we are at now. 
If the market starts to move upwards in the near future, many of the short-sellers will exit their short positions by buying back bitcoins in the open market. As the price moves further up, even more short-sellers will get margin calls or hit their pre-set stop-loss levels, forcing them to cover their shorts, and creating a self-reinforcing mechanism that can cause sharp price increases. Whether this will happen again this time, however, still remains unclear. Another possible explanation is that there is a significant amount of arbitrage going on right now centered on the Bitfinex exchange, following the surge in the bitcoin price yesterday that brought the price on Bitfinex to nearly USD 7,800 at its peak. That was close to USD 1,000 higher than on other exchanges like Coinbase, where bitcoin reached a high of about USD 6,800 yesterday.  An obvious way for traders to take advantage of a situation like that is to short-sell bitcoin on Bitfinex, while buying bitcoin on Coinbase or another exchange. That way, a trader would be profiting as the price gap between the exchanges closes. The bitcoin price was nearly unchanged across exchanges on Tuesday morning, and still remains significantly higher on Bitfinex than on other exchanges, which many in the community attributes to speculation and fear about the status of the popular stablecoin Tether. Price differences at exchanges: "
0," Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has enjoyed a staggering price increase in excess of 150,000 percent since it was first listed on exchanges back in July 2010. Since then, the cryptocurrency has also experienced multiple bull runs, bear runs (the longest of which consumed much of 2014 and 2015) and stronger media attention year on year.  From a technical perspective, the relationship BTC has with traditional charting patterns is occasionally counter-intuitive to what one would normally expect.  Take, for example, the descending triangle which is typically bearish in nature. While it does contain the prospect for breaking either way, the repeated failed (bearish) descending triangle breakdowns over the course of bitcoin’s life cycle, leaves an unanswered question, are we viewing these patterns the wrong way? And if so what makes this year different?  Bitcoin’s relationship with the 200-day moving average (DMA) and descending triangle pattern has been significant. Descending triangles are measured by connecting a series of lower highs, usually angled at 45 degrees and breaking down left to right thus creating a primary trendline. The secondary baseline connects two or more of the lowest lows in a series to form the horizontal ‘floor’.  What you end up with is a descending triangle pattern that demonstrates a gradual loss of confidence in the asset you are looking at. When the patterns and indicators are combined on bitcoin’s weekly chart they show a consistent counter-play to their traditional bearish norms. As can be seen, price generally breaks bullish from the formation instead of continuing to lower supports as it normally should. The only other time bitcoin broke down from the descending triangle was back in March 2014. Post-breakdown, the bulls managed a short-term rally before being rejected by the 200-DMA, which held price under for 1.2 years. It’s clear that the price of bitcoin being under the 200 DMA firmly establishes the market as bearish, and this time around is no exception. That said, history would suggest an upside break of the current descending triangle may be on the cards soon, and that could initiate a move above the DMA as a sign of a larger trend reversal.  While it does offer insights into the relationship bitcoin has with the 200-DMA, it is key to remember that the patterns also vary in scope and size, which is usually telling of the price action that follows. So, based off the previous 1.2 year bear run, it’s possible bitcoin could turn bullish by early next year, especially if all fundamentals are taken into account, as suggested by CNBC cryptotrader, Ran Nuener. On the flipside, bitcoin has been staring down a bear market for the last 7 months and has dropped below the significant 200-DMA beginning Feb. 5. Traditional patterns such as descending triangles are still worth viewing in bearish terms since the onset rush from 2017/18 was unprecedented and the subsequent sell-off that followed has seen bitcoin drop 67 percent to date from its all-time-high in December 2017.  As stated earlier, price falling below the 200 DMA has proven to be a sign the market has officially turned bearish.  A bearish trend combined with a bearish price pattern, the descending triangle, creates an ideal technical set up for further depreciation even though bitcoin tends to negate the bear view.  If price does break down as it technically should, there is a prior resistance and support zone in the $4,900 to $5,400 that may once again offer support to the falling price.  If price breaks up as it historically should, the nearby lower highs need to be surpassed on the higher time frames in order to prove a bearish to bullish trend change is in order. The first lower high that price needs to find acceptance above is near $6,850 (differs among exchanges dealing in USDT), while the next is closer to $7,400.

1," This morning, Bitcoin (BTC) rose almost 10% in less than an hour. After the Bitcoin price jump, investors began dumping money into the other digital assets, causing the market to widely shift green. Last week, Bitcoin had its first major sell-off in months, but this morning it rose nearly $600 in less than an hour. Late last week, it looked as if Bitcoin was going to drop just below the $6,000 mark, but it’s now comfortably trading over $6,500. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $6,655.71 a coin, up 5.48%, in 24 hours. In seven days, BTC is up 0.264%, and for the month, the world’s first digital currency is up 1.7%. >> XRP Climbing After Crypto Market Correction Late in the day last Wednesday, the crypto market began to tank.

1," Bitcoin price gained bullish momentum against the US Dollar and Tether (USDT) during the past few hours (UTC 08:20 AM). There was a sharp upward move in BTC/USDT above the USD 7,500 level due to a nasty slide in Tether below the USD 0.950 support. BTC/USD also gained traction and surged above the USD 6,500 and USD 6,700 resistance levels. However, buyers failed to hold gains and bitcoin price reversed most of its gains. BTC/USD is back to USD 6,600 and it is currently trading with a positive bias. Similarly, ethereum, bitcoin cash and ripple rallied recently before trimming most of their gains. Overall, the recent price spike ignited a lot of volatility in the crypto market, which could help bitcoin buyers in the short term. Total market capitalization  After testing the USD 6,200 support, bitcoin price  started an upward move. BTC/USD broke the USD 6,350 and USD 6,400 resistance levels to climb sharply higher. It even spiked above the USD 6,850 resistance, but sellers quickly reversed the bias. 
The price declined sharply and traded below the USD 6,700 level. It is currently trading near the USD 6,600 mark, with an immediate support near the USD 6,500 level. The most important support on the downside awaits at USD 6,400. On the upside, the price needs to regain the USD 6,700 level to climb back towards USD 6,800. Ethereum price  broke the USD 200 resistance zone to enter a positive area. ETH/USD climbed above the USD 205 and USD 215 resistance levels.
The price also traded above the USD 220 level, but later it declined below USD 215. It is currently up 5% to USD 211, with an immediate support at USD 210. On the upside, buyers need to settle the price above the USD 225 resistance for further gains. Bitcoin cash price  rallied above the USD 450 and 475 resistance levels during the recent upward move. BCH/USD tested the USD 490-500 resistance zone, which prevented further upsides. The price is currently down to USD 462 and it may well continue to trade lower towards the USD 450 support.
Ripple price  surged above the USD 0.450 resistance and even spiked above the USD 0.465 level. Later, XRP/USD reversed gains and it is currently trading near the USD 0.445 level. It seems like a proper close above the USD 0.450 level is needed for a larger upward move. Many altcoins gained traction and moved up between 7%-20%, including komodo, DROP, holo, bytecoin, BTG, DGD, MOAC and NPXS. Overall, the recent upward move in bitcoin price seems like a false spike, but as long as BTC/USD is holding the USD 6,400 support, it could climb higher once again. Similarly, if ETH/USD stays above the USD 210 level, the pair may possibly retest the USD 225 resistance.

1," This Monday morning brought mixed feelings into the market. While major cryptocurrencies skyrocketed, investors are worried about the drop of the biggest stablecoin Tether. The top three cryptocurrencies by market cap - Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple - are were up by around 10% on Monday morning before trimming their gains to less than 7%, while the other follow suit with slightly smaller price jumps. One notable exception, however, is Tether (USDT): the stablecoin pegged to the US dollar was down to USD 0.86 before recovering to USD 0.96. Tether price chart: Bitcoin price chart: Top 10 coins by market capitalization (UTC 07:37 AM): Although the rest of the market seems like a cause for celebration, Tether’s downward plunge got the whole community worried. The biggest question: is Tether truly backed by USD? The company has yet to provide conclusive evidence of this, despite their repeated insisting that all Tethers are redeemable at USD 1. Since cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and Tether share the same CEO, speculations about the extent of their involvement with each other abound. Bitfinex has come forward with a statement that they are not insolvent only a week ago, but that “complications continue to exist for us in the domain of fiat transactions.” In the eyes of traders, the downward spiral of one could spell disaster for the other. Tether’s role as a dollar substitute has made it a huge part of the global crypto ecosystem. Playing a big part on exchanges that do not support crypto-to-fiat trading, it is easily transferable between all exchanges and other online platforms because it doesn’t have to travel through the banking system. This means Tether is the second-most actively traded cryptocurrency: it was used in more than 20% of transactions tracked by coinmarketcap.com over the past 24 hours. Vijay Ayyar, head of business development at Luno, a cryptocurrency exchange, said for Bloomberg, “If traders start to flee Tether, it’s a potentially precarious situation, since it accounts for 20% of total volumes globally. It basically implies a lot of volatility ahead.”  Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin has halted Tether deposits and withdrawals, citing “USDT wallet system maintenance” and without any information when trading may commence.  Bitfinex has news, also: Fiat deposit update - October 15th, 2018. https://t.co/F8o2ltVCN4 pic.twitter.com/ukE9JsRB0j The community is worried: on the popular social network Reddit, user u/Toyake commented, “Tether is currently trading at 91 cents, this could very well be its collapse. If Tether goes down, the whole market goes down. Get the popcorn!” In short, the community believes that people are selling Tether and buying Bitcoin.  Community reactions: The key point here is that USDT panic manifests in manic crypto-buying on Chinese exchanges (Binance, OKex, Huobi) where there are a lot of USDT holders, and of course on BitfinexThis premium in crypto is the real ""Tether panic-selling"", not the /USD pairs on Kraken/Bittrex ______ Well, this is a nice and exciting way to end all that boring sideways.Won't need coffee this morning. ______ There's indeed a big difference between Tether Exchanges and normal exchanges.However, on normal exchanges we're also breaking the downtrend as we speak and the price is there $6,600.I'm not scared about the USDT situation, I'm happy with the upwards movements. $BTC pic.twitter.com/Btz7J824xv ______ If this is a true bank run on $usdt, I would not be surprised if exchanges that have exposure to #Tether halted trading.Would that be positive for $BTCUSD?

1," Volatile price swings and plummeting valuations have been a reality for bitcoin investors of late, but those who own traditional equities haven’t been immune either. In fact, bitcoin and the S&P have correlated on and off for almost a year, each taking turns as the leading indicator. Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency advertised as digital gold due to its difficult means of production and limited supply, is expected by some to act as a “safe haven asset,” one that rises or remains stable in times of economic turmoil (just as its metal companion traditionally has).  To date, though, rarely has that been the case.  Since Oct. 10, both bitcoin and equities markets have taken a notable plunge, and interestingly enough, to around the same degree. The S&P 500, the benchmark for equities worldwide, at its lowest point of the day of $2,710 market a 5.69 percent loss from the opening price of the day prior.  Similarly, bitcoin’s low yesterday of $6,205 marks a similar 6.7 percent depreciation from the opening prices two days ago, according to data from Binance.  The respective performances suggest bitcoin is behaving like a risk asset rather than a safe haven alternative – a claim backed up by their technical charts.  The daily chart comparison between the S&P 500 Index (SPX) and BTC shows a similar correlation in price action and direction, with a notable dip in both markets in September and October.  It has often been the case that as bitcoin gains in value, so too does the SPX, and vice versa, providing an indication on the status of investor sentiment worldwide. Observing the end of September for bitcoin, we see how prices peaked and sharply fell as the month of October rolled around, the SPX also retraced around the same time.  The first indications for bitcoin’s most recent breakdown appeared on the SPX on Oct. 4-5, demonstrated by the peak in price and a bearish 3-candlestick breakdown that triggered a sharp sell-off. Bitcoin followed suit a day later after printing a similar bearish candlestick on both charts. So, for now, it seems as though the SPX is providing signals for the bitcoin market a day or so in advance.  Risky assets are the ones that have a significant degree of price volatility and do not offer fixed returns. Further, the prices of these assets tend to rise when the domestic and global economy is growing.  For instance, stock markets do not offer a guaranteed return and usually rally when the economy is doing well and vice versa. On similar lines, emerging market currencies, base metals and oil are risky assets, which closely follow the action in the major stock exchanges across the globe. BTC does share some of the properties of the risky assets. For instance, there are no fixed returns in the bitcoin market and historically, it’s been highly volatile. More importantly, it is closely following the stock markets. So, it is safe to conclude that BTC is currently being treated as risk assets by some investors. The leading cryptocurrency will likely start behaving like a classic safe haven asset after its adoption rates have increased significantly.

1," Bitcoin price saw heavy downsides recently as it broke the USD 6,400 and USD 6,350 support levels. BTC/USD tested the USD 6,200 support where buyers emerged, and later an upside correction was initiated. Major altcoins like ethereum and ripple also started and an upside correction after forming a decent support base. However, the current recovery may not last long since the market sentiment is still bearish, and the previous supports will most likely act as resistances. Total market capitalization  After testing the USD 6,200 support, bitcoin price  started an upside correction. BTC/USD moved above the USD 6,250 and USD 6,300 resistance levels. However, the price is facing a few important resistances near the USD 6,380, USD 6,400 and USD 6,450 levels.
The mentioned resistances near USD 6,400 were supports earlier and now they are likely to cap upsides. On the downside, a proper close below the USD 6,200 support could increase selling pressure on bitcoin it the near term. Ethereum price  declined below the USD 200 support and tested the USD 190 level. ETH/USD is currently correcting higher, but it is facing resistance near the USD 200 and USD 205 levels.
If there is a break above the USD 205 level, the price is likely to face a strong barrier near USD 215. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 190, below which there is a risk of more losses towards the USD 175 level. Bitcoin cash price  tested the USD 425 level and recovered a few points. BCH/USD may continue to correct higher, but the USD 460 and USD 480 levels are likely to protect gains. The most important resistance for buyers is positioned near the USD 500 level. The key supports on the downside are USD 425 and USD 410.
Ripple price  recovered nicely and it is currently up more than 3% to USD 0.428. XRP/USD must break the USD 0.440 and USD 0.450 resistance levels to extend the current recovery towards the USD 0.500 level in the near term. Recently, Coinbase Pro announced that the 0x token (ZRX) will be launched on their platform, which boosted the price. A few other altcoins like LOOM, MANA and BAT also gained between 8%-15%. Overall, bitcoin found support near USD 6,200 and is currently recovering. However, buyers are facing a lot of hurdles near USD 6,400. Therefore, a major recovery in BTC/USD is very unlikely. If sellers regain control, there could be a fresh round of selling in bitcoin and major altcoins in the coming sessions.

1," Less than a week left for the crypto community to tell the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) what they think of the proposed bitcoin-based exchange traded fund ETF from VanEck. Since June, almost 1,400 comments have been submitted. The SEC recently extended the time period for which it will review comments from the public on the matter. It further went on to list 18 detailed questions about statements made in the ETF proposal that it asked to public to comment on.  Jake Chervinsky, a Washington-based lawyer specializing in government enforcement related to the blockchain industry, tweeted: Reminder: you have one week left to submit comments in response to the SEC's questions on the VanEck/SolidX bitcoin ETF proposal.Go here (https://t.co/RpJfcOAvjM) & click ""Submit Comments on SR-CboeBZX-2018-040"" to tell the SEC what you think.Public opinion matters. Be heard! A decision on whether to approve or disapprove the proposed ETF is not expected until the first quarter of 2019. While the community is somewhat divided in terms of what benefits an ETF listing could bring to bitcoin, the general consensus remains that it will at least provide a temporary boost to the bitcoin price. Unsurprisingly, Gabor Gurbacs, digital asset director at VanEck, is among those who believe an ETF would bring strong benefits to the number one cryptocurrency: What an #ETF brings to #Bitcoin:-Increased liquidity via the AP & ETF ecosystem-Lower counter-party risk-Better valuation and execution practices -Separation of duties: trading, custody, valuation-Lower fees-Compliance with global regulations -Asset mgmt experience pic.twitter.com/R1ACMd3EQ6 Meanwhile, some members of the bitcoin community, including technologist and serial entrepreneur Andreas M. Antonopoulos, are against Wall Street money pouring into bitcoin in the form of an ETF. “ETFs fundamentally violate the underlying principle of peer-to-peer money, where each user is operating not through custodian, but has a direct control of their money, because they have direct control of their keys. Your keys - your bitcoin, not your keys - not your bitcoin,” Antonopoulous warned in August adding that Bitcoin ETF will become an instrument to manipulate bitcoin prices, scaling and forking debates.  In either case, until October 17, everyone has a chance to tell what they think.  Then comment and say so!I think any intelligent contribution to this discussion is valuable & worthwhile. It's also important for the SEC to get multiple informed perspectives so they can better understand crypto in general. And here is what people told the SEC (unedited):  Maxwell Gomersall
To whom it may concern,
I am writing about the Bitcoin ETF decision to express my opinion on your decision.  
I believe it is time you stop pushing the decision back and chose what to do, delaying the inevitable simply looks ridiculous. Many have sent you their opinions regrading this topic and are in support of an ETF and not to mention the institutions who are awaitning your decision. Postponing this is not going to change the outcome Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will have a large role in our future and this is one of the first steps as the innovators America is known as make the right choice and approve the decision as people will look back at this one day and wonder why it took so long to make such a clear decision.  
Furthermore, the decision is vital for the US economy as a stock market crash is due and once this happens many will lose their savings and jobs which without a safe and assuring alternative like Bitcoin many institutions will go bust or have no where to place their money making their growth stagnate. This will only be bad for the US economy as if they had the option to invest in Bitcoin they would be receiving positive returns which will lead to growth in their business and therefore growth in US economy despite the market crash which will happen in the next 4 months if not earlier.  
I strongly urge you to approve the decision before the opportunity is missed.  
Yoirs sincerely,
Maxwell Gomersall
_______ Bobby Mulligan
Dear members and representatives of the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"").
I would like to express my strongest opposition against allowing Bitcoin (""BTC"") Exchange Traded Funds (""ETF's"").
BTC shows little promise for being effective as a ""store of value"" or medium of exchange with its transaction costs being much more than the current centralized clearinghouse model that is in place today. Additionally, there is no accountability for transaction clearing, which can be concerning on many fronts. With little more than speculative supply and demand value, the average unaccredited investor can suffer from the ""greater fool"" phenomena.  
In its unregulated and short existence, BTC has existed in an environment of fraud, crime, and speculation, and I do not believe there is true investor value outside of those three factors for the asset. Because of the high transaction expenses, there are no reasonable efficiencies to be had from the BTC technology, though refinement and other applications may exist.
Sincerely,  
Robert Mulligan

Hi, it's very important to have a Bitcoin ETF because the average Joe's aren't sophisticated enough to buy and handle the complexities of owning Bitcoins. The Bitcoin ETF makes the whole process safe and transparent. Bitcoin and crypto assets aren't going away. It's NOT a fad. Please approve this

A Bitcoin ETF is a natural next step in the evolution of finance and I fully support this effort. Do not be on the wrong side of history, rather propel the future and approve this measure.

1," The prospect of a deeper drop in bitcoin prices has increased, price-volume analysis indicates. The world’s most valuable cryptocurrency, which had been trading sideways since September 22, fell sharply to a three-week low of $6,220 on Bitfinex yesterday, confirming a range breakdown. The technical indicators on the daily chart also turned bearish, validating a negative moving average crossover on the long duration charts. Essentially, bears regained control 24 hours ago, opening the doors to the key support of $6,000. Furthermore, the bearish case is now looking stronger than it did 24 hours ago due to these three factors:  As seen in the chart above, BTC witnessed a Bollinger band breakdown yesterday and also penetrated the support of the trendline drawn between the June 24 low and Aug. 11 low. This will likely embolden the bears, as the trendline had repeatedly put the brakes on any sell-off in the first half of September. Further, the trendline is now acting as a stiff resistance to the bulls.  Trading volumes on Bitfinex jumped to five-week highs yesterday. More importantly, total trading volume across all cryptocurrency exchanges rose 36 percent to $5.18 billion – the highest level since Sept. 21 – according to CoinMarketCap. The fact that trading volumes have grown places greater significance on the bearish move, as a high-volume drop is always considered a strongly negative indicator.  The high-volume drop was accompanied by a 10-percent drop in BTC/USD long positions and a 7.4 percent rise in BTC/USD short positions on Bitfinex. A break below key support, when accompanied by an unwinding of long positions and a rise in short positions, indicates scope for a deeper sell-off. So, it seems safe to say that the path of least resistance is to the downside. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,312, representing a 0.9 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. The slight recovery from three-week lows seen overnight is likely associated with the oversold conditions seen on the relative strength index (RSI) on the hourly and 4-hour charts.

0," The cryptocurrency market took a huge hit nearly 12 hours ago when Bitcoin (BTC) abruptly dropped over $200 in value within minutes. After BTC dropped, a widespread cryptocurrency sell-off took place and hasn’t slowed down since. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $6,264.43 a coin, down -4.63%. Most of the cryptocurrency market has followed Bitcoin’s spiral, and most coins in the top 15 cryptocurrencies by their total market cap are seeing double-digit percentage losses. Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $201.10 a coin, down -11.07% in 24 hours, and XRP is now valued at $0.405 a coin, down -13.33%. The total cryptocurrency market cap has fallen by $19 billion in the past 24 hours. Since January, $600 billion has been wiped in value from the market. There are many speculations as to why Bitcoin tanked. One investor tweeted: It is plausible that investors and traders in Asia have contributed quite largely to the drop in the price of Bitcoin today. The volume of crypto exchanges in South Korea and Japan (Bithumb, Bitflyer) are huge. https://t.co/1nAHd9BezV — Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) October 11, 2018  The tweet still doesn’t explain why there was a sell-off, but it may show where it predominantly came from. “The global sell-off in equities has indeed spilled over to the crypto space,” Ryan Rabaglia, head of trading with cryptocurrency dealing firm OSL in Hong Kong, told Fortune. “The days of crypto being the safe-haven play and having a high degree of detachment from the rest of the world are seemingly diminishing.” Rabaglia seems to think that the global sell-off of equities has spilled over into the crypto space. Another analyst felt the Bitcoin dip was due to panic selling. Panic selling was the cause of the drop of cryptocurrency from January to February, but is that the case now? “What we’re seeing now is a bit of panic selling,” Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM told CNBC. “Investors that were in it, and maybe caught the hype in November and December, are now panic selling out.” I’m not so much convinced in the panic selling. It’s been nearly nine months since the cryptocurrency market plummeted and I think those with weak stomachs to the rises and falls of the crypto space have already left. >> A Crypto PayPal?

0," It looks like Bitcoin just reached another important milestone on the way to mass adoption. It's called the Liquid Network and it's live now. This is a sidechain built on the Bitcoin network by San Francisco startup Blockstream. A sidechain is a separate blockchain that is linked to the main blockchain through what is referred to as two-way pegging, which enables digital assets to be interchangeable between the two chains without jeopardizing their performance or speed. ""The Liquid Network provides fast, secure, and confidential transactions to address the needs of exchanges, brokers, market makers, and financial institutions around the world,"" Blockstream CSO Samson Mow said in a blog post.  According to him, the launch of the network after three years of development marks ""the beginning of a new era of digital asset issuance and transacting by enabling the tokenization of fiat, gold, securities, and even other new crypto assets – all with Bitcoin at the center."" The startup claims that Liquid has these benefits:  However, the biggest problem most bitcoin fans have with Liquid is that it is a “federated sidechain,” relying on a group of companies to collectively manage the sidechain, making it centralized. “Following a federated consensus approach was the easiest way to deploy Liquid, but its consensus could change in the future,” tweeted Lucas Nuzzi, bitcoin researcher.  Don't underestimate @Blockstream's #LiquidNetwork sidechain launch. It's kind of a big deal.I get it, federated round robin consensus doesn't sound appealing, but it's a start. The implications of usable sidechains are huge and the positives certainly outweigh the negatives👇 Moreover, the startup claims that ""no single party, including Blockstream, can control the Liquid network, and furthermore, no single entity is in control of more than a single Liquid functionary server."" Other than just facilitating faster trade, Liquid lets partners launch tokens on the platform, representing financial instruments, fiat currencies or crypto assets. The startup even claims that the sidechain works better than the smart contract blockchain Ethereum for launching tokens. Additionally, Blockstream will be deploying a wallet specifically for Liquid transactions, while hardware wallets Ledger and Trezor have unveiled plans to adopt the technology as well. Also, there is an undisclosed monthly subscription fee for users of this new network. The sidechain has become another important development for Bitcoin alongside the Lightning Network. In comparison, while the Liquid sidechain is purpose-built to cater for the needs of exchanges, brokers and traders, the the Lightning Network is designed to enable the near-instant transfer of small or micro value payments between linked channel members and merchants. Meanwhile, there is always that part of the community that doesn’t care about the technology too much. Twitter user WhalePanda, a famous crypto enthusiast, ironically tweeted referring to the recent drop in the market:   Last night's dump on all cryptocurrencies was obviously because of the release of Liquid. Damn you Blockstream."

Still, the crypto community loves to speculate, with some Twitter users suggesting that it could be the result of a large over-the-counter (OTC) buy order. OTC trading refers to trading outside of exchanges – often favoured by large investors as they seek to avoid affecting market prices with their orders. Its looks like OTC buy order, as wallet is new, there is no old transactions. if this was transaction to exchange then it would dumped Others, yet, say that the transaction was merely a move from a single key wallet, to a multisignature wallet – a type of wallet that requires several private keys in order to make transactions. Moved from an address which was merely protected by one single private key to a multisig wallet. Only reasonable to do so with that amount. Although the so-called bitcoin whales are often blamed whenever are large downward price movements in the bitcoin market, new data compiled by blockchain analysis company Chainalysis suggests that this group of very large holders may in fact be a stabilizing force for the market. By studying available data on the 32 largest bitcoin wallets, Chainalysis found that whales are indeed a rather diverse group, and that only about a third of them could be considered “active traders.” Two thirds of whales are, in other words, long-term holders of bitcoin, not doing anything with their holdings even when the rest of the market is selling off heavily. Perhaps even more interesting is that the whales that are considered active traders were largely trading “against the herd,” thus smoothing out market movements both to the upside and downside.  According to the firm, this was particularly true during the major price declines of December 2017 and throughout 2018, when the largest traders were in fact net buyers of bitcoin, providing crucial support to a market that was otherwise dominated by smaller retail traders and hobby investors."
0," Latin American e-commerce platform Rappi has announced that it will begin accepting Bitcoin pay from its Colombian customers. The company has over 30,000 couriers, and has been described by the North American media as a “Latin American tech unicorn.” Per Argentina-based media outlet Infobae, Rappi decided to roll out Bitcoin pay following a customer survey of its Colombian users – although it has not yet reveled exactly when the service will become available, or what sort of payment platform it will use. Rappi’s popularity has skyrocketed in Columbia since it was founded in the country three years ago. Per Axios and Techcrunch, the company “raised more than USD 200 million” in August this year, in a new funding at “a valuation north of USD 1 billion.” Major investors include the likes of Hong Kong-based DST Global, as well as American venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. Thus far, it appears Rappi will only be offering Bitcoin pay options to its Colombian customers. However, the company is also extremely popular in Mexico, where experts have recently claimed that crypto usage will be mainstream “by 2020 or 2021.” Infobae states that some 50% of Rappi’s sales are made in Mexico City.  The e-commerce platform is also active in Argentina – where cryptocurrencies are rapidly gaining popularity, with dozens of Bitcoin ATMs now being installed across the country. Rappi also operates in Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. As well as traditional e-commerce retail, the company also offers a range of quirkier services, such as courier-delivered ATM cash withdrawals and dog walking. Colombian lawmakers are currently mulling the introduction of crypto-specific regulations and a flat 5% tax on cryptocurrency-related earnings. Meanwhile, the country’s biggest star – football player James Rodriguez – has recently launched a digital token in conjunction with a Chinese blockchain company."
0," Bitcoin’s drop to three-week lows today has likely kick-started a bearish move towards the major support at $6,000, technical charts indicate. The leading cryptocurrency fell to $6,252 at 7:15 UTC on Bitfinex – the lowest level since Sept. 19 – and was last seen trading at $6,300, representing a 5-percent drop on a 24-hour basis. The failure to capitalize on Monday’s move above the crucial 10-week exponential moving average (EMA) resistance of $6,998, despite the upside break of a key falling trendline, ended up emboldening the bears, as expected. More importantly, the sell-off witnessed in the last few hours has put an end to a prolonged period of lateral trading. The technical indicators have rolled over in favor of the bears, adding credence to the bearish setup on the long duration charts. Further, the big drop in the equity markets this morning may not bode well for BTC, as the cryptocurrency is still being treated as a risk asset. As a result, the cryptocurrency is eyeing a drop toward $6,000. Here are four reasons why that is looking likely:  The Bollinger bands (standard deviation of +2, -2 on the 20-day moving average) on the daily chart have been moving in a sideways manner since Sept. 22, signaling a lack of clear directional bias. As a result, bitcoin price volatility, as represented by Bollinger bandwidth and the gap between weekly high and low, fell to 21-month lows and 15-month lows, respectively, last week. A prolonged period of low volatility usually makes way for a big move in either direction. In BTC’s case, that move looks to have already started to the downside, with a breach of the lower band, and may move further towards $6,000.  The relative strength index (RSI) has breached the rising trendline and fell into the bearish territory below 50.00. Notably, it is pointing lower and is well short of the oversold region (below 30.00), meaning there is enough room for a sell-off to $6,000. Meanwhile, the choppiness index has dropped below the 61.8 level and is pointing south, indicating that bearish move is gathering strength. Further, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) has produced a bearish crossover.  The bearish view put forward by the negative crossover between the 5-month and 10-month EMAs has gained more credence, courtesy of BTC’s failed breakout and a drop to three-week lows. Notably, the moving averages turned bearish last month for the first time since September 2014.  BTC’s drop to lows below $6,300 comes a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) shed 800 points. This isn’t the first time that the leading cryptocurrency has followed the action in the equity markets. As seen in the chart above, BTC pretty much mimicked the DJIA in the last quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. Looking ahead, the equities could drop further, courtesy of the rising bond yields, and push BTC lower. While many argue that BTC is a safe haven asset, the historical price action suggests that it in fact tracks equity markets. This is hardly surprising as BTC is still struggling to get mainstream exposure and investors may feel more secure with other classic safe-haven assets like gold (currently at $1,200 per Oz), which is also struggling to post gains.

0," Attempts to guess what direction the crypto market will take next now have a new angle and it's called “the industry is on the brink of an implosion.” At least, according to a new study by digital commerce and fintech analysis firm Juniper Research that claims that this year’s sell-off in the crypto market may have just been the beginning of a broader decline of the crypto economy.   The study, dubbed The Future of Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin & Altcoin Trends & Challenges 2018-2023, pointed to the fact that daily bitcoin transaction volumes have fallen from around 360,000 per day in late 2017, to 230,000 as of September 2018. According to the researchers, worsening economic conditions internationally this year should be favorable for alternative currencies like Bitcoin, considering events such as the decline of several fiat currencies due to global trade tensions, Brexit, and currency-crises in several developing countries including Turkey, Argentina, and Venezuela. As these events so far have failed to translate into higher crypto prices, Juniper concluded that “it is unlikely to prosper as and when these issues are resolved.” “Like any asset, it is worth whatever someone is prepared to pay for it, but it has no meaning or existence beyond the confines of the ledger. It is a bubble, and there is a strong possibility that this bubble could burst in the near future,” report author Dr. Windsor Holden claimed, adding that “bitcoin has no intrinsic value.”  “In short, given our concerns around both the innate valuation of bitcoin, and of the operating practices of many exchanges, we feel that the industry is on the brink of an implosion,” he said in a white paper accompanying Juniper's research. Also, according to Holden, there is a decline in the base of individuals who are willing to pay inflated prices for cryptocurrencies, credit card companies have banned customers from paying for bitcoin on a card, and social media sites have banned initial coin offering advertising: ""Taken together, this means that there is likely to be less demand, with less funds available to invest in Bitcoin."" However, recent news may show a bit different perspective. For example, David Swensen, chief investment officer at Yale University, who by many is considered the most influential investor in the world, has now reportedly invested in two crypto-focused venture funds. Also, Coinbase, the US-based fiat-to-crypto exchange and wallet service, is reportedly valued at USD 8 billion and in talks with Tiger Global, an investment firm, for up to USD 500 million. This is a sure sign that the industry is more than just “tulips,” according to famous Bitcoin bull Michael Novogratz. Meanwhile, a recent informal poll by Fundstrat Global Advisors, a Wall Street research company, indicated that the usually very cautious Wall Street investors are now overwhelmingly calling a bottom in the bitcoin market. Twitter users, however, are still skeptical, with a majority saying bitcoin still has room to fall. In the past, Juniper Research has also published research painting a more nuanced picture of the cryptocurrency market. In September, the firm found that 64% of respondents in a survey said their company was already actively engaged in, or considering, various blockchain related initiatives, marking a significant increase from the 34% of companies that said the same thing last year. The study further revealed that nearly half of those companies were looking to Ethereum as their platform of choice."
0," Bitcoin is having a tough time scaling a key moving average hurdle that has kept the bulls in check for four weeks straight. The obstacle that is proving so hard to beat is the 10-week exponential moving average (EMA), which stalled a rally attempt from around $6,100 in mid-September. Since then, BTC has notably failed to produce a weekly close (Sunday’s close as per UTC) above the EMA, establishing it as a crucial level to beat for the bulls. At press time, BTC is trading at $6,580 on Bitfinex, having clocked a weekly high of $6,730 on Monday. The 10-week EMA, meanwhile, is flatlined at $6,698. The retreat in the last three days indicates that BTC has failed yet again to leap the EMA hurdle, weakening the odds of further gains toward $7,000.  As seen in the chart above, the 10-week EMA has been firmly capping bitcoin prices for a month. On Monday, BTC crossed the trendline sloping downwards from July highs, confirming a bullish breakout. While one would have expected the price to now be well above the 10-week EMA hurdle, the EMA hurdle is, in fact, still intact. The rejection at the 10-week EMA despite the upside break on Monday may now embolden the bears. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

0," China holds more influence over Bitcoin than many are ready to admit, which could damage the whole network, a new study shows. The country “threatens the security, stability, and viability of Bitcoin” with its “political and economic control over domestic [cryptocurrency] activity, and control over its internet infrastructure,” shows the study from Princeton and Florida International Universities. The research paper, titled The Looming Threat of China: An Analysis of Chinese Influence on Bitcoin, goes on to explain: “As the value and economic utility of Bitcoin have grown, so has the incentive to attack it. We singled out China for analysis because they are the most powerful potential adversary to Bitcoin, and we found that they have a variety of salient motives for attacking the system and a number of mature capabilities, both regulatory and technical, to carry out those attacks.” The Bitcoin mining system is “heavily centralized,” the study goes on to say, as “over 80% of Bitcoin mining is performed by six mining pools,” with five of those managed directly by individuals or companies based in China. This could make a 51% attack viable, as the combined effort of Chinese mining pools accounts for 74% of Bitcoin’s hash power (or computing power). “This is a significant share of the global hashrate – more than controlled by any other single country – but the precise quantity is unknown,” the study adds. ____ “If the Chinese government assumed control of domestic hash power, this property would grant them an advantage in selecting blocks for the ledger, which is important for some types of attacks.” The research defines four attack classes: censorship, deanonymization, weakening consensus, disruption to competing mining operations. In total, the academics identified 19 different attacks currently available to Chinese mining pools. Ideologically, China might even be incentivized to try to destroy Bitcoin, given its centralized regime of totalitarian communism. Even worse than outright destroying it, China might weaponize its control over Bitcoin in order destabilize foreign economies, the researchers believe. However, some in the crypto community disagrees. Reddit user u/igadjeed calls the idea of the mining pools banding together to destroy Bitcoin “academic racism,” adding: “The fallacy here is - because it happens in China, the Government can control it.” They go on to explain, “The blatant fallacy here is - mining pools control miners. There are hundreds of thousands of miners in the ‘Chinese’ mining pools, and most of them are not in China. If there was authoritarian coercion of pool managers, the miners would most likely abandon those pools. Yes, the concentration of pool managers in China is a centralisation issue. Currently, the pools do not censor which transactions get included in a block, except that transaction fees influence choice of transactions, as they always have [but] mining centralisation issues are mostly mitigated by the fact that miners are independent operators. If a pool becomes corruptly managed, the miners will choose a different pool.” The paper has not yet been peer reviewed, so its findings should be taken with a grain of salt."
0," The deputy head of Israel’s tax bureau has announced that the government is prepared to accept alternatives to the first in, first out (FIFO) system for taxing cryptocurrency-related earnings. Experts say the move could save investors big money on their tax bills. Per media outlet Calcalist, Roland Am-Shalem, the Deputy Director General of the Israel Tax Authority (ITA), told a Tel Aviv blockchain conference that investors would instead be allowed to choose to how they pay their taxes rather than using the FIFO calculation method – which critics say often over-taxes investors. Am-Shalem stated that investors could opt out of FIFO taxation calculations, which match the value of the assets of tokens to those that are most recently purchased. FIFO calculations are essentially estimations – used in cases where tax authorities have trouble estimating the precise value of assets. Cryptocurrencies are recognized as “assets” in Israel, meaning they have financial value – but not as “currencies,” which can lead to legal confusion over their precise worth. Some experts say the imprecise nature of FIFO accountancy has resulted in Israeli investors paying hefty bills on their crypto earnings, but the new announcement could potentially do away with this. Media outlet The Marker quotes former ITA deputy chief Gidi Bar Zakay as saying, that doing away with FIFO will let investors instead “calculate their cryptocurrency profits accurately, resulting in a real tax calculation.”  This, says Bar Zakay, will “lead to profits worth hundreds of millions of shekels [1 ILS = 0.27 USD] over the years.” Am-Shalem, however, insisted that such “real tax calculation” declarations would need to be backed up with proof – like blockchain-verified times and dates of purchase. He also insisted that such calculations would need to show “consistency” if they were to be accepted. The move has been welcomed by crypto experts in the country. The Marker quotes an accountant specializing in cryptocurrency matters as saying that flexibility will allow many investors to pay less tax. The accountant said, “Quite a few of our customers have actually received tax rebates using the FIFO method.” The accountant concluded that Am-Shalem’s announcement would allow investors and their accountants to choose a preferred calculation method based on their own individual situations.

0," Bitcoin saw a low-volume bullish breakout Monday, but the long-awaited move is sending mixed signals to investors The leading cryptocurrency cleared the trendline sloping downwards from the July 25 high and Sept. 5 high around midday yesterday, adding credence to the argument put forward by many, including billionaire investor Novogratz, that the market has carved out a long-term bottom around $6,000. However, so far, the bullish trend change hasn’t significantly revved up investor interest. This is evident from the fact that the total trading volume rose by a meager 15 percent yesterday, according to CoinMarketCap. More importantly, 24-hour trading volume is holding below $4 billion (near the yearly low so far). Further, the follow-through has not been impressive either. By now, one would have expected BTC to be trading above last week’s high of $6,741. After all, the breakout occurred after a prolonged period of low volatility action. Instead, it is trading at $6,650 at press time and is holding just above the trendline support (former resistance) of $6,630 Hence, there is merit in being cautious, despite BTC’s move above the falling trendline.  As seen in the daily chart, BTC closed above the 2.5-month long falling trendline yesterday, signaling a bullish reversal. However, the lackluster response to the upside break likely indicates that investors need a more credible evidence of a bullish breakout. The cryptocurrency is likely to adopt a stronger bullish bias if it can cross the next key hurdle at $6,775 (upper Bollinger band) on the back of strong volumes.  As can be seen, BTC has been struggling to find acceptance above the 10-day exponential moving average (EMA) since mid-September. Therefore, BTC’s upside break of the trendline, as seen in the daily chart, would look more convincing once the 10-day EMA is scaled.

1," David Swensen, chief investment officer at Yale University, is reportedly betting that the cryptocurrency market will move higher from here. The university’s chief investor has become something of a legend over the years as his investment success on behalf of the university has been compared to that of Warren Buffett, also known as “The Oracle of Omaha.” Swensen, who by many is considered the most influential investor in the world, has now invested in two crypto-focused venture funds, anonymous sources told several media outlets over the weekend. The first investment is reportedly in the new USD 300 million crypto fund by Silicon Valley investment powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz. The second investment was reported to have been made in Paradigm, another new crypto fund started by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, former partner at venture capital giant Sequoia Capital Matt Huang, and former Pantera Capital employee Charles Noyes. The reason the news is so significant is largely due to Swensen’s track record as one of the most consistent outperformers in the world of professional money management. He has successfully managed Yale University’s USD 29.4 billion endowment fund since 1985, when the fund was just over USD 1 billion.  In a tweet from former Wall Street banker Mike Novogratz on Friday, he summed up the sentiment  by explaining that Swensen is effectively saying that “bitcoin is a store of value,” while calling him “the alpha bull of the herd.” This is really big news.  David Swenson the most influential investor in the world.  By making this investment he just said the bitcoin is a store of value.  He’s the alpha bull of the herd.  Congrats ⁦@_charlienoyes⁩ ⁦⁦@FEhrsam⁩  https://t.co/uUsz4MOvwI Others also seem to be excited by the news, with many calling it “huge” news for the cryptocurrency market. HUGE one today: David Swensen, the “Warren Buffet” of endowments, is betting on crypto through TWO Silicon Valley funds — Andreessen’s & Paradigm — team effort with ⁦@levynews⁩  https://t.co/HJaGo6GRgI ____ When DAVID SWENSEN invests in Bitcoin & Cryptos, the world listens. Very positive for BTC & Cryptos moving forward.https://t.co/rUXfjIUPQS pic.twitter.com/RufXDLFJPf Many other endowments have over the years tried to replicate Swensen’s investment strategy, which is said to favor private equity and other less-liquid assets over publicly traded stocks and bonds, as well as having a longer time frame than most other investors. Yale University manages the second largest college endowment in the US, only behind Harvard. Over the past 20 years, Swensen has returned an average annual return of close to 12%. Meanwhile, as recent study from Yale University showed, cryptocurrencies may generate higher risk-adjusted returns than stocks and other assets traditionally thought of as “safer.”
____ Listen to Spencer Bogart, a blockchain venture capitalist, a partner at Blockchain Capital, speaking to CNBC about the Swensen’s move: ___ Also, here's another discussion on the move:"
1," It’s an open secret that trading in bitcoin has become more difficult in recent months than it once was. Traders rely on volatility to make their money, and with less volatility, there are fewer opportunities to trade. For long-term holders and users of bitcoin, however, it’s a very different story, and low volatility is generally seen as a sign the bitcoin market is maturing. According to Gil Luria, research director at wealth management firm D.A. Davidson & Co., the recently stable bitcoin prices means that there is less speculation in the bitcoin economy. “When speculators are involved, they drive unusually high volumes as well as volatility by trading the asset with high frequency. As speculator involvement is diminished, volumes go down and volatility goes down as well,” Luria told Bloomberg. The same sentiment was also echoed by Mike McGlone, commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, explaining that bitcoin is now exhibiting signs of a “maturing market, so volatility should continue to decline.” “When you have a new market, it will be highly volatile until it establishes itself. There are more participants, more derivatives, more ways of trading, hedging and arbitraging,” McGlone said. Judging from the data, it appears the experts are right that both trading volume and volatility is down. Although most notably for bitcoin, the data confirms that the same is also true for many other cryptocurrencies. The unusually low volatility in bitcoin is confirmed by a technical indicator known as the Average True Range (ATR) indicator, as seen in the bottom of the chart below. Looking on a day-by-day basis, volatility in the bitcoin market is now down to levels not seen since July 2017, before the huge run-up in prices seen later that year. Although volatility may be low at the moment, bitcoin’s price chart looks like it is about to break-out from a massive chart pattern that has been forming since the beginning of this year. Judging from the pattern seen above, with lower highs but a floor around the USD 6,000 mark, it appears that bitcoin is about to face another battle between bulls and bears that will determine its next move. As we have seen throughout 2018, the selling pressure has been heavy on bitcoin, but buyers have consistently shown up at USD 6,000 to support the market. Over time, sellers have become exhausted as they have not been able to drive the price further down, and we have seen lower volatility as a result. The next few weeks may give us an indication of which side is stronger in the fourth quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, a new informal poll indicated that the usually very cautious Wall Street investors are now overwhelmingly calling a bottom in the bitcoin market. Twitter users, however, are still skeptical, with a majority saying bitcoin still has room to fall. In either case, the next time you read a price prediction from an expert trader, you should probably take it with a large grain of salt."
1," Bitcoin price volatility continues to drop, with one measure having reached a 15-month low. Weekly volatility, as calculated by the difference between the high and low, fell to $317 last week – the lowest reading since the first week of July 2017 – according to Bitfinex data. More importantly, the leading cryptocurrency witnessed a trading range of $498 and $741 in the previous two weeks, respectively. The data indicate that BTC is being squeezed in an ever-narrowing price range and, as per technical rules, a decisive move is overdue. Other measures of bitcoin price volatility are also echoing similar sentiments. For instance, Bollinger bandwidth reading fell to the lowest level since December 2016 last week. The lifeless trading pattern suggests both bulls and the bears continue to remain on the sidelines, offering very little directional bias to the cryptocurrency. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,600 on Bitfinex, representing just 0.15 percent gain on a 24-hour basis and a 0.40 percent rise on a weekly basis.  BTC defended $6,100 and created a bullish outside reversal in the third week of September, as seen in the weekly chart. However, the follow-through has been anything but encouraging. Notably, the cryptocurrency created a doji candle last week, signaling indecision in the marketplace. The odds of a big bullish move would rise if BTC finds acceptance above the last week’s high of $6,741. On the other hand, a move below the last week’s low of $6,424 may embolden the bears.  Over on the daily chart, the lateral trading has brought BTC closer to falling trendline sloping downwards from July highs. The bearish trendline would be breached if BTC continues to move sideways in the next 48 hours, however, the sideways breach of the falling trendline does not qualify as a breakout, as per technical analysis theory. Only a convincing upside move above the trendline hurdle would confirm a bullish breakout. The daily chart also shows that the choppiness index has dropped below the 61.8 percent level, indicating BTC could be in the early stages of a big bullish or bearish move.

1," Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, on Thursday came out with a new informal poll indicating that the usually very cautious Wall Street investors are now overwhelmingly calling a bottom in the bitcoin market. Twitter users, however, are still skeptical, with a majority saying bitcoin still has room to fall. The firm had polled 25 financial institutions during a private dinner, and compared the results with 9,500 individual Twitter users.  When and at what price will Bitcoin bottom? ___ Among the institutions, 57% said they believe each bitcoin will be worth anywhere between USD 15,000 and “the moon” by the end of 2019. Among Twitter users, however, only 40% shared the same view. Where is Bitcoin's USD price by YE 2018 and YE 2019? ___ Fundstrat’s survey further revealed that 59% of institutions identified bitcoin (BTC) as their favorite coin out of 15 coins shown, while 46% of Twitter users said Ripple’s XRP was their favorite token. XRP, however, was also named the “most polarizing token” in the survey results, and no institutions chose it as their favorite.  Which top 15 tokens will be the best and worst performing in 2019? ___ ___ Which of the 15 token's investment thesis makes the least sense? Further, the firm asked participants whether they believed cryptocurrency prices would rise during a recession. Important to note here is that a majority of the institutional respondents did not believe we will see a recession in the next 18 months. If a recession does happen, however, 72% of institutions polled believed that crypto prices would rise.  Will cryptocurrency prices rise if there is a recession? ___ What is the most important macro factor influencing crypto prices? Some members of crypto community, such as Tone Vays, a trader and analyst, however, are not convinced, expressing the contrarian investment viewpoint that the majority is always wrong about market movements. The majority is wrong... Yes, the majority is ALWAYS wrong... I call it the 'stupidity' of the crowd. Thank you @fundstrat for proving that #Bitcoin falls in a recession & that $BTCUSD will NOT bottom till Mid 2019! pic.twitter.com/wXEv7fnY7f In conclusion, the firm said bitcoin is likely to “meaningfully outperform” other coins on the market between now and year end 2019, given the institutional preference for the coin and the expected inflow of capital from new initiatives, including the upcoming Bakkt app.  Meanwhile, former Wall Street banker and now-famous crypto bull Mike Novogratz, this week expressed a more cautiously optimistic view of the number one cryptocurrency, telling participants at the Economist Finance Disrupted seminar in New York that he does not believe bitcoin will break the USD 9,000 level this year.  In comparison, a month ago, Tom Lee reaffirmed his USD 20,000 bitcoin price target for the end of the year. Overall, bitcoin prices have in recent months become less and less volatile, and have largely traded in a range between USD 6,000 and USD 8,000 since May of this year. Since early September, that range has become even tighter, keeping prices between the USD 6,200 and USD 6,800 levels, as the market is waiting for a breakout in the bitcoin price."
1," Local government authorities in Australia have given their blessing to a deal that will see cryptocurrency exchange giant Binance invest USD 2.5 million into an Australian crypto startup – potentially opening the door for crypto pay options for travelers at international airports. Binance has struck a deal with TravelbyBit, a Queensland-based company that provides blockchain technology-powered payments solutions for travel industry companies. Per a joint press release, Binance and its new partner will look to create blockchain-powered point-of-sale (POS) payment systems at major airports around the world. Caleb Yeoh, CEO of TravelbyBit, claimed, “We’re working with the most innovative airports and retailers who want to offer their consumers non-traditional payment options.” Earlier this year, the company announced that ""travelers from all over the world are now able to pay using digital currency at Brisbane Airport, the world’s first digital currency airport."" As part of TravelbyBit’s payment system, the merchants at Brisbane Airport range from restaurants to souvenir shops and cater to all guests arriving and departing through the airport’s international terminal. TravelbyBit’s existing payment platform currently supports transactions in Bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin. Under the terms of the investment deal, the Australian company will also add support for the Binance Coin token to its platform. The state of Queensland, which had previously handed TravelbyBit a USD 71,000 business growth grant, has expressed its support for the deal. Per the press release, Queensland’s Minister for Innovation and Tourism Kate Jones stated, “It is great to see a local company partnering with one of the most established multinational companies in the blockchain ecosystem.” The startup has reportedly partnered with more than 150 merchants across Australia to accept digital currencies, and is looking to use the new investment to expand their reach across the country and turn Australia into a more crypto-friendly travel destination for people from around the world. In January, TravelbyBit published a story about Robert, an eighty-year-old Singaporean Bitcoin investor, who traveled Australia on crypto."
1," With bitcoin (BTC) stuck in a narrow trading range for the 13th day in a row, the bulls need to force a move above $6,800 to confirm a breakout, according to the technical charts. BTC has been restricted to a narrow range of $6,800 to $6,500 since Sept. 22 and this lack of clear directional bias has pushed the volatility reading to a 21-month low. The daily volatility as represented by the Bollinger bandwidth – a technical analysis tool derived by dividing the gap between the Bollinger bands by price’s moving average – has dropped to 0.078, its lowest level since December 2016. A prolonged period of low volatility often paves way for a big move in either direction. So, it seems safe to say that BTC could soon witness a bullish or bearish breakout (though we have been saying this for a while now, and the big move is still to come). At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,600, representing a 1.65 percent gain on the day.  The Bollinger bands (standard deviation of +2, -2 on the 20-day moving average) are moving in a sideways manner, indicating there is no clear trend in the bitcoin market. For a bull breakout, BTC’s price needs to find acceptance above the upper Bollinger band of $6,800. On the other hand, a move below the lower band at $6,290 would see the bears take charge. Right now, the prospects of a downside break appear highest, as the cryptocurrency is again struggling to clear the 50-day exponential moving average (MA), currently located at $6,640.

0," Argentina is set to welcome an influx of cryptocurrency ATMs as the inflation-hit peso continues to take a financial battering. Reuters reports that a company named Athena Bitcoin, which late last month installed the country’s first Bitcoin ATM at a Buenos Aires shopping mall, says it will install a total of 30 machines in Argentina before the year’s end. The same media outlet also reports that an American company named Odyssey Group hopes to install a further 150 ATMs “at the end of the year,” with a view to having 80% of the machines fully operational “at the beginning of 2019.” Odyssey Group says its ATMs will also allow customers to make conventional bank transactions. The move will be Odyssey Group’s first foray into Latin America, but Reuters quotes the company as saying it is increasingly looking to expand its activities across the entire region. Athena Bitcoin already operates 12 ATMs in Colombia, as well as a machine in Mexico. The company says it hopes to expand its operations to Chile and Brazil. A company spokesperson said the machines – which currently only allow customers to conduct Bitcoin transactions – will be modified in the future, allowing for transactions in other tokens, such as Litecoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash. Argentina’s peso has been in freefall for much of 2018, with massive interest rate hikes doing nothing to stop its decline. In May, the country’s president asked the International Monetary Fund for a USD 50 billion loan – however, citizens are increasingly transferring their assets into foreign currencies and digital tokens as confidence in the peso continues to suffer. Data from LocalBitcoins, a peer-to-peer bitcoin marketplace, shows that weekly bitcoin trading volume on this marketplace is more than 20 bitcoins over the past few months.  As reported by Cryptonews.com, the number of crypto ATMs in the world is rising steadily, and that they're enjoying increased usage from customers. Still, the legal status of crypto is preventing their growth from being as impressive as it could be, while stubbornly high fees are placing a limit on customer usage. Crypto ATMs around the world:"
0," Bitcoin bears have been emboldened by repeated rejection from a key moving average hurdle, but they may take a breather over the next 24 hours as the price heads for another key trend line of support.  The world’s premier cryptocurrency is lacking a strong bullish or bearish bias in the near-term given that its price action has largely traded sideways since the beginning of September. That said, the repeated failure to find sustained acceptance above the 50-day moving average and $6,850 resistance gives the upper hand to bears, as it indicates that the path of least resistance is still to the downside.  Bulls might be ready to fight back, however, after bouncing off of a month-long ascending support trend line that has allowed prices to form a series of higher-lows.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,506 on Bitfinex, after having bounced off of the support trend line at $6,424 earlier today. Daily chart  As seen above in the daily chart, any bullish momentum for BTC has been halted by the 50-day moving average and $6,850 resistance zone. It’s worth noting the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is also nearing a bearish cross which may hint at more downside action to come.  However, the bearish MACD cross has yet to be confirmed. On top of that, bulls may be able to put up a fight by finding support on the ascending trend line that has been in effect since Sept 8th. Bitcoin’s price has been able to form a higher low on the trend line three times in the past, so making a fourth is not out of the question.  Also of note: the compressing relative strength index (RSI) and narrowest Bollinger Band width since Dec. 2016 suggest price is overdue for volatility.  4-hour chart  Having failed to find acceptance above the 200 EMA on the 4-hour chart, again, confirms the path to the upside remains filled with obstacles. That said, it is evident that bears have not yet gained full control since a near oversold 4-hr RSI – when combined with the ascending support – has allowed the price to form a series of higher lows.  Currently, in a stalemate, bears will look to extend losses to the previous higher low of $6,328 if price finds acceptance below the rising support.

0," Bitcoin price mostly consolidated above the USD 6,500 support during the past few hours. BTC/USD made an attempt to clear the USD 6,650 resistance, but buyers failed to gain momentum. Similarly, Ethereum is finding a strong selling interest near the USD 235 level. The current market sentiment is neutral-to-bearish as long as bitcoin is trading below the USD 6,800 resistance. Altcoins like bitcoin cash and QTUM are showing positive signs and may perhaps continue to climb higher in the short term. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin price remained above the USD 6,500 support with a positive angle. However, there were multiple rejections noted around the USD 6,650 resistance in BTC/USD. At present, the price is trading flat near the USD 6,580 level with an immediate resistance at USD 6,620 and USD 6,650.
If buyers gain momentum above the USD 6,650 resistance, the price is likely to revisit the USD 6,800 resistance zone. On the other hand, the USD 6,500 level is a strong support, below which there is a risk of more declines towards the USD 6,400 and USD 6,320 support levels. Ethereum price remained confined in tiny range above the USD 220 level. ETH/USD seems to be facing a tough resistance near the USD 235 level, above which there are chances of a fresh rally towards the USD 250 level.
On the flip side, if sellers push the price below the USD 220 support, the price will most likely trade towards the USD 205 support in the near term. Bitcoin cash price is currently up more than 1% and is trading above the USD 540 support. BCH/USD needs to break the USD 560 resistance to climb further towards the USD 600 level. On the downside, supports are visible near the USD 540 and USD 520 levels.
Ripple price struggled to clear the USD 0.600 resistance and declined. XRP/USD is currently down more than 3% and is trading near the USD 0.560 level. The main supports are at USD 0.550 and USD 0.532. A few altcoins climbed higher today, including cortex, FUN, NEM, IOST, ELA, ELF, ETN, SC and BCN. Out of these, cortex rallied around 24% and FUN gained more than 12%.
To sum up, bitcoin price is showing a few bearish signs below the USD 6,650 and USD 6,800 resistance levels. Buyers need to soon jump into action to push the price above the USD 6,800 barrier. If not, there is a risk of a bearish reaction in BTC/USD and altcoins in the coming sessions.

0," Bitcoin’s price looks vulnerable to modest slippage in the next 24 hours, as its persistent failure to pass a key moving average hurdle could embolden the bears. The leading cryptocurrency has been in a narrow sideways drift in recent days, with the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) proving a tough nut to crack since Saturday. BTC’s inability to cross the 50-day hurdle indicates that the bullish move from the Sept. 19 low of $6,100 has lost momentum. As a result, the door is now open for the bears to make their presence felt over the next 24 hours, and prices could be forced down to $6,300. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,580 on Bitfinex, having faced rejection at the 50-day EMA level of $6,649 earlier today.  As seen on the daily chart, the 50-day EMA has been capping the upside in BTC since late September. It is worth noting that BTC is trading below all three major moving averages – 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day EMA – which could be considered a bearish sign. However, these averages are flatlined, which indicates that BTC has lacked a clear directional bias for far too long. As a result, a big move in either direction is overdue.  Over on the 4-hour chart, BTC is trading just below the lower edge of the ascending triangle, meaning the bull failure at the 50-day EMA is beginning to prove costly. Furthermore, the relative strength index (RSI) has fallen back below 50.00 in bearish territory. A downside break would be confirmed if the current or the next 4-hour candle closes below the triangle support. In that case, BTC could fall quickly to $6,328 (Sept. 28 low).

0," Venezuela’s economic crisis continues to worsen, despite the president’s controversial attempts to revive his country. The demand for Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies continues to rise this year, as the country’s dollar, the bolivar, continues to drop. Venezuela has hit crisis mode extreme, but can BTC save them? According to Coin Dance, Venezuelan residents’ interest in Bitcoin (BTC) reached its peak in July of this year. Most countries have declined since January of 2018, when the total crypto market hit its all-time high. In December, BTC hit just under $20,000 a coin, and altcoins hit record-highs the first week of January. Since then, the crypto market has dropped $500 billion in value. The interest recently in Bitcoin by the residents in Venezuela at this time is rather shocking. However, with the country’s economic downfall, it seems its residents are doing anything to try and survive in their country. According to the International Organization for Migration, since the year 2015, around 1.6 million people had fled from Venezuela. Many have fled to other South American countries such as Peru, Brazil, Argentina, and Columbia. >> Malta Prime Minister: Cryptocurrency is the “Inevitable Future of Money” Back on August 10th, five zeros were dropped from the country’s currency after its inflation levels had risen to stratospheric levels. The country rolled out a ‘new’ and revamped currency just after this and its inflation rose 100% in just three weeks, the Financial Express reported. At this time, investments in BTC remained at record-highs around the country. Other than devaluing the country’s currency by 100% and renaming it to the sovereign bolivar, the country’s president, Nicola Maduro, announced his oil-backed cryptocurrency that would be pegged to the new Bolivar. This was in hopes to go around sanctions and gain access to international finances to get the inflation under control. Many within Venezuela felt this was illegal and many countries urged their banks not to buy Venezuelan debt. Despite Maduro making strong efforts to push his Petro coin, interest has dropped dramatically, and residents are still sticking to Bitcoin (BTC). Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Paulpaladin"
0," Bitcoin price dipped towards the USD 6,300 - USD 6,400 support area recently where buyers emerged. BTC/USD recovered steadily and moved back above the USD 6,500 resistance. Similarly, major altcoins like ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash completed a short-term downside correction and later bounced back. Having said that, buyers are currently facing important resistances like USD 6,800 for BTC/USD and USD 235 for ETH/USD. If there is a successful break above the stated resistances, the market could climb further higher into the positive zone. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin price failed on more than two occasions near the USD 6,800 resistance. BTC/USD corrected lower towards USD 6,400 where it found support and later recovered above the USD 6,500 and 6,550 resistance levels. 
The price is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) trading near the USD 6,600 level with an immediate resistance at USD 6,650. Above this, the price will most likely trade towards the USD 6,750 and USD 6,800 resistance levels. On the downside, the key weekly supports are USD 6,400 and 6,320. Ethereum price stayed above the important USD 200 support. ETH/USD cleared the USD 215 and 220 resistance levels, but buyers seem to be struggling near a crucial hurdle at USD 235.
If buyers surpass the USD 235 barrier, there could be decent gains towards the USD 244 and 250 levels. On the downside, the main supports are visible near USD 215 and USD 200. Bitcoin cash price failed to break the USD 600 resistance and corrected lower. BCH/USD is currently trading well above the USD 500 support with an immediate resistance at USD 550. Above USD 550, buyers are likely to take control for a push towards the USD 600 weekly resistance.
Ripple price is down around 1.5% to USD 0.580. XRP/USD recently spiked above the USD 0.600 level, but buyers failed to keep the price above the stated level. On the downside, the main weekly supports are at USD 0.572 and USD 0.550, and resistances are USD 0.600 and USD 0.620. During the past three sessions, a few altcoins gained traction, including odyssey, nebulas, verge, THETA, siacoin, wanchain and ZIL. Out of these, Odyssey and nebulas traded higher by 34% and 23% respectively. To sum up, bitcoin seems to be holding the ground very well above the USD 6,400 support. However, BTC/USD buyers need to surpass the USD 6,800 barrier to set the pace for more upsides. If not, there is a risk of a bearish break in BTC and altcoins in the coming days. _____"
0," Bitcoin traded in a range of just under $1,500 over the course of the month of September, its narrowest monthly trading range since July 2017, data reveals. At close of trading Sunday, bitcoin (BTC) officially ended the 30-day period with a trading range of $1,329, with prices oscillating between a low of $6,100 and a high of $7,429. Overall, this was the lowest one-month range since July 2017, when bitcoin traded in a $1,095.8 window, according to data from Bitfinex.  Further, the monthly trading volume throughout September marked its lowest amount since April 2017, according to the exchange, one of the world’s largest. Periods of low volatility often come to a boisterous end for bitcoin especially when accompanied by low volume, so it seems the cryptocurrency is gearing up for a decisive move in either direction.   Bitcoin concluded its September candlestick inside the low and high of the prior month’s candlestick, creating a pattern known as the “inside bar pattern.” In trending markets, the pattern can present strong buy or sell signals if current prices surpass the range of the prior month.  Since the market for bitcoin has been in a bearish downtrend since December of 2017, current prices falling below the low of September ($6,100) would likely confirm more downside action is to come and set scope for prior support/resistance level near $4,900. On the other hand, if September’s range high is surpassed ($7,429), it would be a bullish indication for longer-term upside potential and possible bull market revival.  The current bear market draws many parallels to that of bitcoin’s bear market in 2014-15. Notably, the current bear market just began its 11th month, while prices now sitting on the 20-month moving average (MA) for support. The timing is rather impeccable when compared to the 2014 market since its 11th month also rested on the 20-month MA.  This would suggest a decisive move could be incoming since falling below the MA in the 12th month of the 2014 bear market further cemented the trend in bearish favor, of which it was unable to escape until returning above the MA in November of 2015.

0," Bitcoin (BTC) seems to have built a base around a key moving average in the last four months, although, so far, it has not been able to produce a definitive bullish breakout. Throughout 2018, the leading cryptocurrency has set lower price highs, indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. Despite the bearish setup, the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) has served as a strong floor since June. More importantly, the failure to beat the EMA support for four straight months indicates that the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached in December has likely run its course. So, it seems safe to say that the stage has been set for the cryptocurrency to jump above the recent lower price high of $7,429 hit a month ago and confirm a bearish-to-bullish trend change. Even so, the bulls have been reluctant to push prices north of $6,800 in the last two weeks. Still, since BTC tends to perform well in the last three months of the calendar year, that may be about to change. At press time,  BTC is trading largely unchanged on the day at $6,585 on Bitfinex.  As seen on the monthly chart, BTC produced a minor rally to $8,500 in July, after finding support at the 21-month EMA in June. Further, the sellers failed to penetrate the EMA support in August and September, establishing it as a key level to watch out for in the near-term.  Over on the daily chart, the 5-day and 10-day EMAs are flatlined, indicating that the bitcoin market is currently lacking a clear directional bias. The outlook as per the daily chart would turn bullish if and when the cryptocurrency finds acceptance above the trendline connecting the July 25 high and Sept. 5 high. As of writing, the trendline resistance is located at $6,802. The bear failure, as seen in the monthly chart, does indicate scope for a break above the trendline hurdle in the near-term.

1," Bitcoin (BTC) is reporting losses for a second straight month, but there are hints of a bullish breakout ahead in the fourth quarter. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,570 – down 6.30 percent from September’s opening price of $7,014. BTC also registered a 10-percent decline in August, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). However, despite the back-to-back monthly losses, the cryptocurrency is flashing a 2 percent gain for the third quarter. Further, the quarterly gain could have been much bigger had the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) not rejected a notable application for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Bitcoin jumped to a two-month high of $8,507 on July 25, confirming an upside break of the four-month-long falling channel. However, the long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change was short-lived as prices fell back below $8,000 on July 27, courtesy of the SEC’s second rejection of the Winklevoss brothers’ application for a bitcoin ETF. Nevertheless, the leading cryptocurrency posted a 21 percent gain in July, snapping the longest losing streak in nearly two years. BTC was down for the first two weeks the ETF rejection in late July. The cryptocurrency fell to a low of $5,859 on Bitfinex on Aug. 14 before rising back to $7,000 by the month’s end. Signaling a rotation of money out of high-risk alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin, and possibly into fiat currencies, the BTC dominance rate also rose above 50 percent for the first time since Dec. 19, 2017. It is worth noting that the SEC disapproved several other ETF proposals in the second half of August month. Yet, BTC remained well bid, possibly because the investor community had priced in the widely expected bad news. That resilience triggered speculation that better times lie ahead for the cryptocurrency and overshadowed the 10 percent monthly decline in prices. BTC’s rise to highs above $7,500 in the first half of the month was supplemented by the bullish turn in the weekly MACD. As a result, the cryptocurrency was looking likely to rise further toward July highs above $8,500. Instead, prices fell sharply on Sept. 5, leaving another lower high around $7,500 on the daily chart. The rising wedge breakdown on the daily chart signaled a resumption of the sell-off from the July highs. But, once again, the area around $6,000 proved a tough nut to crack for the bears. The cryptocurrency’s persistent defense of $6,000 has convinced many, including the likes of billionaire investor Novogratz and Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, that the BTC market is experiencing seller fatigue and has reached a bottom around $6,000. However, a bullish reversal would be confirmed only after BTC has found acceptance above the recent lower price high of $7,429.  On the weekly chart, BTC has charted a narrowing price range. Interestingly, the upper edge of the range is located around that $7,429 (August high) price point. A move above that level would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change and allow a stronger rally toward key resistances located at $8,507 (July high) and even $9,990 (May high). Any bullish move post-breakout could be a rapid one as a prolonged period of range-bound trading is often followed by a big spike in volatility, according to technical theory. The prospects of BTC witnessing bull breakout in the fourth quarter are high as the cryptocurrency tends to perform well in the last three months of the calendar year, seasonality analysis indicates. if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""JKCPP""]={},window.datawrapper[""JKCPP""].embedDeltas={""100"":460.020834,""200"":433.020834,""300"":407.020834,""400"":407.020834,""500"":407.020834,""700"":407.020834,""800"":407.020834,""900"":407.020834,""1000"":407.020834},window.datawrapper[""JKCPP""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-JKCPP""),window.datawrapper[""JKCPP""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""JKCPP""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""JKCPP""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""JKCPP""==b)window.datawrapper[""JKCPP""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""});  As can be seen on the above performance table, the cryptocurrency scored gains in the fourth quarter in six out of the last eight years.

0," Bitcoin price remained elevated above the USD 6,400 support level. BTC/USD started a fresh upward move and buyers were able to push the pair above the USD 6,600 and USD 6,700 resistance levels. Similarly, there were decent gains in altcoins like neo, litecoin, QTUM, ADA, tron, ethereum, IOTA and bitcoin cash. The current market sentiment is positive and if bitcoin clears the USD 6,800 resistance, there could be more gains in the near term. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin price formed a solid technical structure above the USD 6,400 support and started climbing towards USD 6,700. BTC/USD gained traction, broke the USD 6,700 resistance, and registered gains more than 4%.
On the upside, there is a significant resistance near the USD 6,800 level. Above this, bitcoin buyers will most likely attempt to surpass the USD 7,000 hurdle. On the downside, the previous resistances near USD 6,600 and USD 6,500 are likely to act as supports if the price corrects lower. Ethereum price finally managed to gain strength above the USD 215 resistance. ETH/USD gained more than 8% and tested the next resistance at USD 230. Above this, the price may climb towards the USD 240 level.
If there is a downside correction, the broken resistance at USD 215 could act as a strong support for buyers in the near term. Bitcoin cash price traded further higher above yesterday’s high and climbed above the USD 575 level. BCH/USD is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) correcting lower towards the USD 540 support. Below this, the USD 520 level could stop the downside correction. On the upside, the USD 560 and USD 575 levels are immediate hurdles for buyers.
Ripple price recovered and moved back above the USD 0.520 level. XRP/USD seems to be facing a lot of hurdles near the USD 0.540 and USD 0.550 resistances. Above these, the price could rally towards the USD 0.620 level. Many altcoins gained traction recently, GAS, XET, ETN, BCN, GXS, PPT, ARDR, BTG, GNT, NEO, LTC and THETA. Out of these, GAS and XET rallied 68% and 53% respectively. Overall, there are many bullish signs emerging on charts of bitcoin. If BTC/USD gains strength above USD 6,800, the price could move further into the green zone. It could also help altcoins like ethereum and ripple to climb higher in the coming sessions.  _____"
0," Bitcoin missed a bull breakout by a whisker, as prices backed off from a six-day high of $6,826 hit earlier today. BTC’s persistent defense of $6,000 over the last three months has convinced many, including billionaire investor Novogratz, that the leading cryptocurrency has bottomed out around that level (February low). However, a bullish breakout would be confirmed only after the cryptocurrency has found acceptance above the top edge of the three-month-long narrowing price range. Crossing that key price hurdle is proving a tough task for the bulls, though. For instance, BTC was solidly bid in early European hours, but the bullish momentum ran out of steam as prices neared the upper end of the narrowing price range, currently located at $6,870. As a result, a definitive breakout remains elusive. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,645 on Bitfinex, representing a 2.5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  On the weekly chart, the area around $6,000 (February low) has repeatedly capped the downside in BTC, which indicates that sellers have likely run dry, having pushed the cryptocurrency down by 70 percent from its record high of $20,000 hit in December.  As seen in the above chart, BTC has formed a large narrowing price range pattern known as a pennant, over the last three months.  A UTC close above the pennant hurdle of $6,870 would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change. More importantly, the ensuing bullish move could be a rapid one as a prolonged period of range-bound trading is often followed by a big spike in volatility, according to technical theory. And, even though the stacking order of the 50-day moving average (MA), below the 100-day MA, below the 200-day MA, is indicating that the path of least resistance is to the downside, price action always takes precedence over lagging indicators like MAs Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

0," In crypto markets, history doesn’t repeat itself, but it does rhyme. In light of ether’s emphatic and near 40 percent recovery in price since mid-September, there’s reason to believe the calls for a “bottom” in the price of ethereum’s cryptocurrency ether (ETH) do have some merit. As it turns out, the current market structure of ETH against its BTC pair is very similar to that of the structure formed during its bottom in December of 2017 before its more than 400 percent bull run.  There is a concept known as “fractals” in technical analysis, which is essentially repeating market structures. Since technical analysis is largely the study of investor behavior, there is a case for theorizing that a repeated market structure can resolve similar to how it did in the past.  If this were to come to fruition, a bottom in ETH/BTC would act as a leading indicator for its USD pair and for the altcoin market in general. Since the majority of altcoins are programmed following the ERC-20 token standard using the ethereum blockchain, there has long been a positive correlation between the performance of ETH and the rest of the altcoin market.   In the above chart, the left panel represents the 2017 market bottom for ETH/BTC after an 84 percent decline from an all-time high of 0.1515 and the right panel represents the current market structure whose bottom is a similar 82 percent decline from all-time highs.  Visually, the two market structures look similar, but there are three distinct similarities that are worth exploring below.  Forming a low above a previous low is known as a “higher low (HL)” and is a sign of bullish move gathering momentum. Further, a “higher high (HH)” pattern also indicates that the bull market is strengthening.  This HL-HH pattern is evident in both charts on the 4-hour time frame and interestingly, the second higher low in both structures formed on the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement.  Exponential moving averages (EMAs) are created by averaging the price of an asset over a specified period of time while putting more weight on recent price information. The tool is useful for traders because price tends to find support or resistance on the EMAs, and the longer the period, the stronger its effect.   The 100 and 200-period EMAs are highlighted in both charts because the way price reacted to them is very comparable. In both cases, the ETH/BTC ratio struggled to find acceptance above the 200 EMA (purple). The price fell back to the 100 EMA (yellow) where it found support and formed its second higher low.  Interestingly, history is rhyming at near identical price levels.  Last but not the least, the rising wedge breakdown confirmed earlier this month looks similar to the one we saw in December 2016.  It is worth noting that the rising wedge is a bearish reversal pattern and is expected to produce a significant sell-off upon confirmation. However, if a significant sell-off does not materialize, then the emboldened bulls usually make a strong comeback, the way they did in December 2017. A similar thing may happen this time as ETH/BTC has bounced off the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement, giving hope to bulls that the breakdown may once again be short-lived.  Using fractals to compare past and present market structures is speculative in nature since history never repeats exactly as it did before. It’s worth playing devil’s advocate to identify differences between the two structures and how things might go awry.  Flipping resistance to support is a bullish price development which was evident in the 2017 market structure but is lacking in the current structure. As can be seen, price in 2017 was able to form its second higher low directly on top of what was a prior resistance level, a bullish sign.  Once again, price found support on top of prior resistance when it spilled out of form its rising wedge, further showing its bullish strength. The current market structure could be seen as less bullish since it failed to hold prior resistance as strong support when it formed its second higher low.    ETH still has some proving to do, and there’s no guarantee this will play out, but it will surely be something interesting watch unfold over the coming days.

1," Bitcoin price found decent support above the USD 6,300 level and recovered. BTC/USD crawled back above the USD 6,400 support and is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) trading in a tight range. The main mover during the past three sessions was bitcoin cash since it rallied more than 15%. Other major altcoins like ethereum and ripple are also trading with a positive angle, but both are facing important hurdles on the upside. Going forward, bitcoin buyers need to gain strength above USD 6,500 for an upside acceleration. If not, it could drop back towards the USD 6,300 level. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin price is currently trading above the USD 6,400 support. BTC/USD recently tested the USD 6,500 - USD 6,525 zone where sellers emerged and protected more gains. It seems like the price is trading in the USD 6,300 - USD 6,500 range.
If there is a break above the USD 6,500 resistance, the price may trade above the USD 6,550 and USD 6,600 levels. On the other hand, a downside break below USD 6,300 could spark heavy slides in the near term. Ethereum price is consolidating above the USD 200 and USD 205 support levels. ETH/USD must move above the USD 215 and USD 220 resistances to move into a bullish zone.
Above USD 220, the next major resistance is near the USD 230 level. On the flip side, the price is likely to find support near the USD 205 level. The main support for buyers is USD 200. Bitcoin cash price performed really well as it broke the USD 460, USD 480 and USD 500 resistance levels. BCH/USD traded towards the USD 550 level and is currently up 16% to USD 520. On the downside, there are many supports, starting with USD 500 and ending with USD 480.
Ripple price trimmed yesterday’s gains and is currently down around 3.5% to USD 0.510. The next major support for XRP/USD buyers is at USD 0.500, below which the price may test the USD 0.480 support. Many altcoins traded higher recently, including UCASH, XET, ETN, STEEM, PIVX, WAVES, BTG and KCS. Out of these, XET and ETN moved up 32% and 24% respectively.
To sum up, bitcoin needs to stay above the USD 6,400 and USD 6,300 supports to gain momentum above the USD 6,500 level. On the upside, a break above USD 6,525 could clear the path for a surge towards the USD 6,700 resistance.  _____"
1," While last week was marked by a surprisingly strong market despite several negative news events, it appears this week is turning out the opposite way. This time, two good news for crypto adoption, announced by Coinbase and Google was not enough to excite crypto traders, who continued to sell off holdings of bitcoin and major altcoins on Wednesday, which marked the fifth straight day of losses for bitcoin.  With the exception of Ripple’s XRP, which surged more than 10% in early Wednesday trading, most of all top 50 coins by market capitalization were in the red for the last 24 hours. In a statement published by Coinbase on Tuesday, the popular US-based fiat-to-crypto exchange announced a new listing process for new digital assets, while saying that their goal is to “rapidly list all assets” that meets their standards. The new statement marks a turnaround for Coinbase, which in the past has been hesitant to list new digital assets on its platform, and for a long time sticking with only bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin as alternatives for their users to invest in. Now, however, it appears that the exchange has finally secured the regulatory assurances it needs to list more assets, even as their listing process becomes simplified. According to the exchange, this becomes possible by making some of the new assets available for users in a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction manner, meaning users in different regions may not necessarily have access to the same assets. Also worth pointing out is that unlike other exchanges that may charge up to USD 1 million to list a new asset, Coinbase said their application process will be free of charge to begin with. In other news from Tuesday, Google said it has once again opened up for ads with crypto-related content in the US and Japan, after placing a ban earlier this year. This time, however, it is treading more carefully, allowing only certain regulated crypto exchanges to advertise using its tools.  Google’s decision follows a similar move from Facebook in July this year, when it said that it will allow crypto-related ads from pre-approved companies.
____ As reported on Monday, as the crypto market has become less sensitive to hype, and investors, speculators have largely held on to their positions over the summer, the bitcoin market will make a major move, for better or worse, only in response to a fundamental change, according to a new research from blockchain analysis company Chainalysis."
1," A three-month long bitcoin price squeeze (BTC) could be nearing an end, with a key volatility indicator reaching its lowest level for 21 months. The leading cryptocurrency has charted lower price highs and lower price lows (pennant) since the end of June and the lack of strong direction bias has both bulls and the bears waiting on the sidelines. As a result, volatility as represented by Bollinger bands width – a technical analysis tool derived from +2, -2 standard deviations of a price’s moving average – has hit the lowest level since December 2016. When measured by standard deviation across all exchanges, volatility is at the lowest since July 2017, according to Bitcoinity. It is worth noting that an extended period of low volatility usually paves way for a strong directional bias, meaning bitcoin could soon witness a big move in either direction. At press time, BTC is trading at $6,490 on Bitfinex. Over on the daily chart, BTC is trapped in a pennant pattern. As of writing, the top edge (resistance) of the pennant is located at $6,900 and the lower edge (support) is seen at $6,270. The Bollinger bandwidth (gap between Bollinger bands divided by 20-day moving average) has dropped to a 21-month low of 0.0975 today. Further, the oscillator is showing that volatility has steadily declined over the last nine months. So, it seems safe to say that a spike in volatility (big move in prices) is overdue and going by the moving average studies on the long-term charts, it could happen on the downside, that is, the pennant support could be breached.  The 5-period and 10-period exponential moving averages (MAs) have produced a bearish crossover on the monthly chart for the first time since the second half of 2014. More importantly, the bearish cross has gained more credence, courtesy of BTC’s drop from the weekend high of $6,841 to the previous day’s low of $6,325.  Over on the hourly chart, BTC is struggling to pick up a bid despite the bullish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) and an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout. All of which indicates that bearish sentiment is quite strong. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing. Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; Charts by Trading View"
0," As the crypto market has become less sensitive to hype, and investors, speculators have largely held on to their positions over the summer, the bitcoin market will make a major move, for better or worse, only in response to a fundamental change, according to a new research from blockchain analysis company Chainalysis. Regulations, new use cases, and developments in technology are possible drivers for the next move in prices, the authors of the research said. “The first challenge of adoption —getting cryptocurrency into people’s hands— has been overcome, but we are now waiting to see what the next stage of adoption looks like,” they added.  The authors suggested that the remarkably stable amount of speculative coins could be indicative of “a market less sensitive to hype,” and that individual news stories no longer affect bitcoin prices to the same extent as they did during the 2017 rally when many new participants entered the market. For example, an interesting thing about the bitcoin rally last week was that the price increased nearly 8% despite news coverage that would normally be considered negative. “The market seems to have recalibrated after the entry of so many new market participants with different beliefs and expectations than those who held bitcoin prior to 2017,” according to the research. Also, both long-term investors and speculators in the bitcoin market have largely held on to their positions over the summer, helping maintain relatively stable bitcoin prices, even as some altcoins have fallen sharply. The research revealed that the number of bitcoins held by speculators has remained stable from May to August this year, at around 22% of the total bitcoin supply. Meanwhile, longer-term investors accounted for 30% of the coin supply over the same time period. To conduct the study, Chainalysis divided the total bitcoin supply of 21 million BTC into five categories depending on how liquid the coins are, or how often they move, ranging from “speculative coins” that are traded often, to “investment coins,” and lastly “lost and unmined coins.”"
0," The trustee for the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox has revealed new details about the pace of cryptocurrency sales as part of the firm’s bankruptcy and rehabilitation process. Attorney Nobuaki Kobayashi explained in a September 25 notice on the Mt. Gox website that over $230 million dollar’s worth of bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH) had been exchanged for fiat currency between March 18 and the start of civil rehabilitation on June 22. According to the notice, the trustee sold 24,658.00762 BTC and 25,331.00761 BCH – quantities that brought in 25,975,702,352 Japanese yen, or $230,269,821.82. Following the sale, the balance in the trustee account was “approximately JPY 70,059 million,” or around $621 million, Kobayashi added. In the notice, the trustee also explained that a trust has been set up to preserve funds in fiat for bankruptcy creditors of the exchange. Explaining the move to sell off the cryptos before the civil rehabilitation was initiated, Kobayashi wrote it was “necessary and appropriate to procure a suitable amount of money to secure the interests [of] the creditors for the principal amount and delay damages of the determined and undetermined bankruptcy claims” before the trust was set up. While some creditors had applied for fiat refunds from the remaining holdings of Mt. Gox, others had requested to have their balances in cryptocurrency returned, since the values of BTC and BCH have climbed far above the levels seen at the time of the exchange’s closure in 2014. While likely good news for creditors seeking to be repaid in fiat, the sell-offs haven’t been welcomed by some quarters of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Indeed, some have argued that the Gox trustee sales are partially behind the bear market seen across cryptocurrencies since the start of the year. Back in March, CoinDesk reported that $400 million in BTC and BCH had been sold off in the preceding months by the Gox trustee, with Kobayashi stressing that the process was being carried out in a way that would not negatively impact the market.

0," Bitcoin (BTC) is on the defensive, having breached crucial support on Monday and could suffer a deeper drop, courtesy of a bearish crossover between key moving averages. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,420 on Bitfinex, representing a 3 percent drop on a 24-hour basis. The bullish break above $6,600 witnessed on Friday had set the tone for a move toward the psychological hurdle of $7,000. However, the rally in alternative cryptocurrencies fizzled out over the weekend. As a result, while BTC managed to hit 17-day highs above $6,800 on Saturday, it fell back below $6,600 yesterday, neutralizing the bullish outlook. Further, the pullback from the weekend high of $6,841 to today’s low of $6,370 validates the bearish view put forward by the negative moving average crossover on the monthly chart. Hence, BTC risks falling to the major support at $6,000 in the next few days.  Over on the daily chart, BTC has found acceptance below the double bottom neckline of $6,600. The bull failure, though encouraging, is not enough to call a bearish reversal. Moreover, BTC is still trapped in the large pennant, and a UTC close below the lower edge of the pattern would confirm a revival of the sell-off from May highs above $8,500. That said, the probability of a downside break is high as per the long duration chart.  As seen in the above chart, the 5-month exponential moving average (MA) crossed the 10-month EMA from above at the turn of the last month, confirming a bearish crossover. More importantly, BTC’s failure to hold above the MAs over the weekend added credence to the negative MA signal. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

0," Over the past week, the bitcoin price has increased nearly 8% in a steady grind higher, taking it above the psychologically important USD 6,500 level. The most interesting thing to note about the rally, however, is that it has come without any obvious fundamental drivers to point to, and despite news coverage that would normally be considered negative for the bitcoin price. As seasoned traders and investors know, it is often considered a very bullish sign when an asset increases in price despite negative news coverage. It shows that the upward momentum is strong, and that there are buyers standing by in the market, ready to buy up even the slightest dip in price. This Sunday, Travis Kling, founder of the new crypto hedge fund Ikigai, on Twitter echoed the sentiment that bear markets normally don’t respond positively to negative news events. You can't ignore the market's lack of negative reaction to the CVE vulnerability announced a couple days ago.That's not what bear markets do. Bear markets ignore positive news events and overemphasize negative news events. Beginnings of a regime change?https://t.co/cJNnrSsBgs In the tweet, Kling referred to a recently discovered bitcoin bug, disclosed in an official Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) report from Bitcoin Core developers. According to the report, an attacker could potentially have exploited the bug to mine invalid blocks, essentially creating new bitcoins beyond the 21 million BTC cap. Despite this serious bug and the warning that there is a small chance of a chainsplit, bitcoin continued its week-long grind higher. Another news story that bitcoin hodlers and traders alike took note of this past week was that we will likely have to wait even longer for the first bitcoin-backed exchange traded fund (ETF) to be approved in the US. In a notice published online, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked for more comments from the public in connection with a proposal to list an ETF backed by “physical” bitcoin by financial firm VanEck. The SEC also made it clear that it needs more time to reach a decision on whether to approve the proposal. Again, the price of bitcoin reacted to the news by trading higher, adding nearly 2% on the day the news was released, before surging close to 4% on the following day. Despite widespread speculation that the ETF may not be approved until March next year, some members of the community attributed the gains to the fact that the language of the official notice was more positive than earlier. In addition, the SECs decision to ask for more comments was largely seen as a positive development, signaling a willingness by the regulator to learn more about the bitcoin market. Perhaps, most entertaining this past week was a show-down between a number of cryptocurrency exchanges and New York’s attorney general.  In a statement, attorney general Barbara D. Underwood blasted cryptocurrency exchanges Binance, Kraken, and Gate.io for failing to provide information requested by her office. She added that the three exchanges have been referred to the New York State Department of Financial Services for “possibly operating unlawfully in New York.” CEO of Kraken Exchange, Jesse Powell, posted a response on Twitter saying that “NY is that abusive, controlling ex you broke up with 3 years ago”, reminding that the exchange is not operating in New York. NY is that abusive, controlling ex you broke up with 3 years ago but they keep stalking you, throwing shade on your new relationships, unable to accept that you have happily moved on and are better off without them. #getoverit https://t.co/DC5S1WyRnp Once again, bitcoin traders appeared unaffected and reacted by sending the coin higher both on the day of the news and the next day. Lastly, Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Zaif became the victim of yet another exchange hacking scandal this past week. In the early hours of September 20, the company issued a statement saying that its network had been compromised by hackers four days earlier. According to the statement, hackers got away with 5,966 BTC, worth approximately USD 40 million, from users’ hot wallets on the exchange. Also, it appears as if the exchange first tried to cover up the hack from its users, saying on September 17 that it had suspended withdrawals and deposits due to “sever failure.” Currently, in addition to BTC and MONA, BCH deposit / withdrawal is suspended due to server failure. We are investigating for recovery. Please refrain from depositing / withdrawing money.Moreover, settlement by ZaifPayment is also stopped. We’re sorry for the inconvenience. As became known three days later, however, the real reason for the suspension was a security breach. Despite this, bitcoin traders didn’t seem to care, sending the number one cryptocurrency surging another 3.9% for the day. So, if following the news makes you confused about what the market is doing, perhaps it is better to instead listen to the words of the legendary American stock investor Jesse Livermore, who once said: “Markets are never wrong but opinions often are.”"
0," This past week, there were decent gains in bitcoin, ethereum and ripple. BTC/USD traded close to the USD 6,850 level before sellers started to dominate. The price corrected lower, but there are many supports above the USD 6,400 level. Similarly, ethereum is placed above the USD 200 pivot level and any dips are likely to find buyers on the downside. More importantly, ripple price is trading with a bullish angle above USD 0.500 and may rally one more time above USD 0.650. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin price topped recently near the USD 6,850 level and corrected below USD 6,740. BTC/USD is down around 1% with an immediate support near the USD 6,600 level. Below this, the weekly supports are visible near the USD 6,520 and USD 6,400 levels.
On the flip side, if the price continues to move higher, the USD 6,850 resistance could stop upsides. Above this, bitcoin buyers may perhaps attempt a clear break above the USD 7,000 level. Ethereum price failed to settle above the USD 250 resistance and is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) trading below the USD 240 level. On the downside, ETH/USD might find support near the USD 222 and USD 210 levels.
Once the current correction wave is over, the price may revisit the USD 250 zone. On the upside, a break above the USD 250 weekly resistance could trigger more gains towards the USD 275 level. Bitcoin cash price failed to stay above the USD 500 level and is currently down more than 2%. BCH/USD may possibly correct further towards the USD 450 support level, below which sellers could regain control. On the upside, the USD 500 and USD 510 levels are crucial hurdles.
Ripple price is down around 3%, but it is still trading above the USD 0.500 support. XRP/USD may clear the USD 0.580 resistance to trade past USD 0.600 and USD 0.620 in the near term. During the past few sessions, a few altcoins corrected lower between 5% - 8%, including IOTA, bitcoin diamond, DGD, DRGN, PIVX, BNT, XMR, MAID, POWR and MKR. Overall, bitcoin is trading with a positive bias above the USD 6,400 weekly support. However, buyers need to push the price above USD 6,850 and USD 7,000 resistances for more gains. If not, there is a risk of a fresh downward move towards USD 6,400 or even USD 6,200. Similarly, ethereum must stay above USD 200 to bounce back in the coming days. _____"
0," Bitcoin has pulled back from 17-days highs clocked over the weekend and risks losing bullish bias if prices close below $6,600, technical studies indicate. A break below that level will make it far harder for the bulls to force a major upside breakout above the crucial resistance at $6,970. However, if prices hold above $6,600 in the next 24 hours, that target may be achievable. The leading cryptocurrency was solidly bid on Friday likely due to an increased investor interest in XRP and other alternative cryptocurrencies. Notably, prices flew past $6,600, confirming a double bottom bullish reversal and opening doors to the psychological support of $7,000. However, the altcoin rally fizzled out over the weekend. For instance, XRP, which was reporting a 75 percent gain at $0.77 in the US hours on Friday, fell back to $0.50 just a day later and is currently threatening to drop below that level. Further, Friday’s other big gainers like aurora and monacoin shed a major chunk of their gains over the weekend. As a result, the rally in BTC was cut short at a 17-day high of $6,841 on Saturday. At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,610 on Bitfinex – down 1.8 percent on a 24-hour basis.  Over on the daily chart, a sustained break below $6,600 (neckline support) would invalidate the bullish setup indicated by Friday’s double bottom breakout. It’s worth noting that the cryptocurrency found takers below that level on Saturday. So, the bears may want to see back-to-back UTC closes below $6,000 before jumping the gun. Should the cryptocurrency defend $6,000 in the next 24 hours, then the top edge of the pennant pattern, currently located at $6,970, could come into play.  The weekly chart shows that BTC created a bullish outside-week candle last week, adding credence to the persistent defense of $6,00–$5,800 range over the last three months. As a result, the odds of BTC rising to the pennant resistance of $6,970 in the near-term are high. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

0," Simple trading methods like the trend-following approach work best when trading cryptocurrencies or financial markets in general. While several technical indicators help identify changes in the strength, momentum, and duration of a trend, none are simpler and more widely used than the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). By definition, the MACD “turns two trend-following indicators, moving averages, into a momentum oscillator by subtracting the longer moving average from the shorter moving average.” Since the MACD is a “trend following” or “lagging” indicator, it trails pricing events that have already happened in order to gauge the strength of the current trend.  Like with most indicators though, money is made by understanding how to use the indicator rather than how it works, but it’s worth explaining the inner workings of the MACD so you get an idea why it is such a beloved indicator. There are three main components to the MACD indicator: the MACD line (blue oscillator), the signal line (orange oscillator) and the histogram.   The explanation may be hard to wrap your head around, but the MACD is one of the easiest indicators to use because of how simply it’s data is visually represented. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it is known as a bullish cross and when it crosses below, its known as a bearish cross. The crosses indicate a shift in trend momentum and represent buy or sell signals depending on the type of cross.  BTC/USD Daily Chart  As can be seen, MACD crosses tend to provide confirmation of a trend change, at least in the short term.  For example, on November 16, 2017, the MACD line made a bullish cross above the signal line, presenting a buy signal. The MACD stayed above the signal line for over a month when the rice went on to rally more than 150 percent before its next bearish cross. The bear cross occurred on Dec. 20, 2017, which signaled a bullish-to-bearish trend change. It’s recommended to use the MACD in conjunction with other indicators like volume, RSI or price action because like any indicator the MACD is not 100 percent accurate and can give off false signals. For example, the bullish crosses in January and March were relatively flat and failed to stay above the signal line for very long, resulting in short-lived price rallies and poor buy signals.  The MACD is great for identifying possible changes in a trend. But it can also identify overbought or oversold market conditions, as we’ll explore below.  The conditions are presented when the MACD and signal line separate too far away from both one another as well as the zero line.  BTC/USD Weekly Chart  As can be seen, the MACD line began to stray noticeably far away from the signal line in December of 2017. Also at this time, both the MACD and Signal were well above the zero line.  The combination of the two warned investors that the surge in price action was causing over-extended market conditions and a pullback was becoming likely.  The zero line marks the midpoint of the MACD oscillator. When the 12 EMA crosses above the 26 EMA, the MACD crosses above the zero line, presenting a buy signal. Conversely, when the 12 EMA crosses below the 26 EMA, the MACD crosses below the zero line and presents a sell signal.  The histogram (pink bars) quantifies the distance between the MACD and the signal line. The histogram prints a bar above the zero line when the MACD is above the signal line and prints below when the MACD is below the signal line. The size of the bar depends on the how great the distance is between the two lines.  As you can see in the above chart, the histogram reaches its highest level when the MACD is at its farthest point above the signal line, implying the rally is becoming overstretched.  Once the pullback occurs, the bearish MACD cross and histogram retreating below the zero line cemented the trend in bearish favor. The MACD is a great tool for the trend following traders, whether you’re a beginner or a professional. It depicts buy and sell signals simply by the crossing of two lines, so even the most novice traders can quickly become comfortable with the tool.

1," Bitcoin has a DDoS (distributed denial of service) vulnerability and developers have warned that everyone has to update the software to a new version or it could all collapse. Now, they add that while the bug has been fixed, there is still a small chance of a chainsplit within the next week or so. The initial patch notes state that, “A denial-of-service vulnerability (CVE-2018-17144) exploitable by miners has been discovered in Bitcoin Core versions 0.14.0 up to 0.16.2. It is recommended to upgrade any of the vulnerable versions to 0.16.3 as soon as possible.” Anyone willing to exploit this bug, however, would have to sacrifice a block reward of 12.5 BTC (more than USD 80,000) to do so.  Although this may seem far-fetched, other possible (and maybe even probable) issues present themselves: a chainsplit, which occurs when two or more versions of a blockchain exist at any one time. All competing versions share an identical history up until the point at which they split. Currently, incompatibilities between different versions of full node software could trigger a chainsplit.  “There is currently a small risk of a chainsplit. In a chainsplit, transactions could be reversed long after they are fully confirmed,” the developers warn, adding, “Therefore, for the next week or so you should consider there to be a small possibility of any transaction with less than 200 confirmations being reversed.” However, they also promise to keep the community updated and add that if a chainsplit should happen, “action may be required.” Currently, double-spending presents the biggest challenge, as there is still a way to try to double-spend, as explained in a full disclosure statement that the developers published. Still, the post adds, “At this time we believe over half of the Bitcoin hashrate [or computing power] has upgraded to patched nodes. We are unaware of any attempts to exploit this vulnerability. However, it still remains critical that affected users upgrade and apply the latest patches to ensure no possibility of large reorganizations, mining of invalid blocks, or acceptance of invalid transactions occurs.”

1," In a recent interview, Michael Novogratz, former hedge fund manager and current Bitcoin bull, mentioned how we will all use bitcoins to pay at Starbucks and Microsoft - something the community quickly picked up on. Reddit is now speculating whether Novogratz is “dropping some insider crumbs of knowledge for us masses” in terms of adoption. At the Yahoo Finance’s All Markets Summit, Novogratz called the crypto price rally of December 2017 “the first global speculative mania ever,” and added that, “Like with any mania, [things] got crazy.”  In terms of adoption, he talked about Bakkt, a heavyweight crypto platform in development, and reminded that Microsoft and Starbucks are partners there, which could drive the companies to start accepting cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. ""You're all going to start using Bitcoin to buy coffee of games soon enough,"" Novogratz said (04:10), adding that “Bitcoin is, I think, going to have a renaissance here soon.” Highlight: Galaxy Investment Partners CEO Mike @novogratz calls the cryptocurrency boom in late 2017 ""the first global speculative mania ever. ... Like with any mania, [things] got crazy."" https://t.co/eKXLsOTUP9 #YahooAMS #bitcoin $btc $xrp $eth #blockchain pic.twitter.com/BKHz7SW5Yn Bakkt partnering with Microsoft, Starbucks and other companies had been announced back in the beginning of August: “The new company is working with a marquee group of organizations including BCG, Microsoft, Starbucks, and others, to create an integrated platform that enables consumers and institutions to buy, sell, store and spend digital assets on a seamless global network.” Back then, Maria Smith, vice president of partnerships and payments for Starbucks, said that, “As the flagship retailer, Starbucks will play a pivotal role in developing practical, trusted and regulated applications for consumers to convert their digital assets into US dollars for use at Starbucks. As a leader in Mobile Pay to our more than 15 million Starbucks Rewards members, Starbucks is committed to innovation for expanding payment options for our customers.” The company later clarified that customers will not be paying directly with bitcoin, but that the company has joined forces with other well-known brands to create a platform to “convert digital assets like Bitcoin into US dollars, which can be used at Starbucks.” “However, we will continue to talk with customers and regulators as the space evolves,” they concluded. Financial results: Starbucks ____
Microsoft Novogratz’s comment is not unfounded then, but the community is speculating that he has insider knowledge that could mean bitcoin adoption in these companies will happen sooner than expected. He has also previously called a bottom on crypto prices. Bottom or not, at least at the time of writing the crypto market is green."
1," The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made it clear that it needs more time to reach a decision on whether to approve a proposed exchange traded fund (ETF) backed by “physical” bitcoins, issued by investment firm VanEck. However, in contrast to previous delays, this time Bitcoin advanced by more than 2% in the last 24% hours. This marks the fourth straight day of gains for bitcoin, bringing it back above the short-term resistance level of USD 6,500 on the chart. The SEC, the agency tasked with approving or disapproving new ETF applications in the US, wrote in the note that it encourages interested persons to provide comments in the weeks ahead, before a final decision will be made. It went on to list 18 detailed questions about statements made in the ETF proposal that it asked to public to comment on. Among questions asked were things like people’s view on whether the bitcoin market is less susceptible to manipulation than other commodities that ETFs typically hold, and whether surveillance and market monitoring by exchanges is sufficient to prevent and detect fraudulent trading activities. The proposal in question was originally filed by VanEck with the help of the Chicago Board Options Exchange on June 6 this year, but any decision on it can be delayed a number of times under current regulations, giving the SEC until early next year to reach a decision. In either case, the crypto community is divided whether Bitcoin ETF will help Bitcoin or will become harmful."
1," The issuance of tether (USDT), the controversial cryptocurrency tied to the U.S. dollar’s value, has had no meaningful impact on the price of bitcoin, an academic study has found. The findings by Dr. Wang Chun Wei, a lecturer at the business school of Australia’s University of Queensland, contradict widespread and long-running speculation that Tether, the company behind the stable cryptocurrency, has been issuing USDT to pump up the price of bitcoin. Wei’s findings have been accepted for the October 2018 issue of Economics Letters. (The paper was originally published online in May.) In the paper, “The Impact of Tether Grants on Bitcoin,” he writes: “Our findings show that tether grants were potentially timed to follow bitcoin downturns and subsequent bitcoin/tether trading volumes increased … However, the impact of tether grants on bitcoin returns were not statistically significant, and therefore tether issuances cannot be an effective tool for moving bitcoin prices.” Tether is the market’s leading stablecoin. It maintains a steady price of about $1, ostensibly by backing each USDT with one U.S. dollar in reserve – though this claim is often disputed and hard to verify since Tether has not published a full audit. While the token has been valuable to exchanges, at least one top-20 exchange has recently moved to shift to a new alternative. Wei’s research focuses on the volume of USDT in the market and changes to that volume. It does not address controversies around the amount of U.S. dollars actually backing USDT. “This is for regulators and auditors to determine,” Wei writes. Instead, the paper simply addresses whether or not the issuance of new USDT could be used to manipulate the price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency. That critique of USDT has been articulated by the anonymous author of January’s “The Tether Report,” who wrote: “The highly correlated growth between tether issuance and bitcoin price raises several interesting questions: Is bitcoin growth driving Tether? Is tether issuance driving bitcoin? If one were to assume the worst case scenario, that bitcoin’s price has been artificially pumped up by tether issuance, one would expect the market price of bitcoin to be closer to $2,000 based on the trendline before April 2017 and the marked growth in tether issuance.” Tether Limited issues new USDT periodically in large lots typically referred to as grants. According to Wei: “The grants seem to occur in groups. I think Tether Limited breaks the grants into smaller blocks and issues them out over a couple of days.” Wei summarized the critique of Tether Limited’s detractors for CoinDesk, writing: “If tether tokens were not fully backed, then for the company to issue new tokens would be equivalent of printing money. If this was true, tether grants/issuances would be equivalent to ‘monetary easing’ in the cryptocurrency markets.” In monetary or quantitative easing, an increased money supply aims to boost economic activity by expanding liquidity. “It was argued that most of the increased Tether was used to purchase bitcoin,” Wei explained. “My paper tries to test this theory out empirically. Is it true that tether grants pushed up bitcoin prices?” The paper notes that bitcoin-tether trading pairs dominate across major exchanges and that more than $2 billion worth of USDT exists on the market. Further, it notes that trading in bitcoin does increase following new USDT grants. Nevertheless, that observation can be misleading. Acknowledging that trading volume is correlated with price, Wei went on to say: “However, you cannot use trading volume to predict price, as the effect is simultaneous. In my paper, I state that past trading volumes do not impact future returns.” To investigate these questions, Wei used two time-series models to input different variables over time and see if there was a causal relationship. The models specifically looked for evidence of changes going forward from new grants. He uses an “autoregressive distributed lag” model and also an “unrestricted vector autoregression” (VAR). Both of these are ways of investigating whether or not there is a causal relationship between something in the past and something in the future. Wei broke it down in layman’s terms: “We have a null model that tries to explain bitcoin returns using past bitcoin returns. We have a full model that tries to explain bitcoin returns using past bitcoin returns and past tether grants.” He summarized: “We then show the full model isn’t actually any better than the null model. Hence, past tether grants must have no impact on bitcoin returns.” In other words, when you add variables about USDT, it doesn’t show any direct impact on BTC returns any better than just looking at BTC on its own. “In fact, when we examine the bitcoin return equation of our VAR model, none of the lagged variables impacts bitcoin returns. This suggests bitcoin returns are showing greater signs of market efficiency than previously studied on older datasets,” Wei writes in the paper. Wei went on to argue that this makes intuitive sense, once the size of the bitcoin market is considered. “The grants come roughly at $100-250 million blocks. The daily trading volume of bitcoin is roughly $5-10 billion USD. At its peak, it was roughly $20 billion,” he told CoinDesk. “So the impact of tether is small. Claims saying that it is tether that props up bitcoin are definitely not true.” Prices on screen image via Shutterstock"
1," Bitcoin (BTC) has taken a bullish turn over the last 24 hours, as sharp gains are also seen across a number of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins). As of writing, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,700 on Bitfinex – up 4.6 percent on a 24-hour basis – having hit a 16-day high of $6,745 earlier today. BTC’s recovery from the five-week low of $6,100 hit Wednesday was likely fueled by increased investor demand for altcoins. For instance, XRP – the third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization – has risen by 42 percent in the last 24 hours and 18 percent of the total XRP trading volume is coming from XRP/BTC pairs, according to CoinMarketCap. Aurora (AOA) is up 57 percent on the day and is the best performing cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap. More importantly, about 60 percent of its total trading volume is also originating from pairs with BTC. On similar lines, MONA’s 43 percent price rise is likely being fueled by MONA/BTC and MONA/JPY pairs, volume data shows. It’s worth noting that most alternative cryptocurrencies are traded against majors like BTC and ethereum’s ETH token. So, money tends to flow into altcoins via BTC, creating upside pressure on the leading cryptocurrency. As a result, BTC could be in for further gains if the altcoin rally keeps attracting investors to the market. On the charts, the convincing move above $6,600 (Sept. 14 high) is painting a bullish picture, at least for the short-term.  As seen in the above chart, BTC moved past the double bottom neckline resistance of $6,600 earlier today, confirming a bullish reversal. The cryptocurrency may well move to test the upper edge of the pennant pattern, currently located at $7,050, over the weekend. A UTC close above that level would add credence to higher price lows set over the last three months and bring potential for a move towards July highs above $8,500.

1," Bitcoin price declined sharply recently and traded below the USD 6,250 support. BTC/USD tested the USD 6,100 support where buyers emerged and the pushed the price sharply higher above USD 6,400. Similarly, there were swing moves in ethereum and bitcoin cash, but prices held important supports and recovered. Overall, the market is back in a positive zone, but buyers need to stay in control. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin price traded above the USD 6,550 resistance, but sellers defended more gains. BTC/USD is down to USD 6,400 and it is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) trading in a range. An immediate support on the downside is near the USD 6,300 level, followed by the USD 6,250 level.
If the price moves higher, it could find sellers near the USD 6,440 level. Above this, the price may perhaps rise back towards the USD 6,500 barrier. Ethereum price dipped below the USD 200 level during the last decline, but it quickly recovered. ETH/USD is currently trading well above the USD 200 support.
Buyers need to push the price above the USD 215 resistance to initiate a fresh upward move. The next resistance above USD 215 is at USD 225, above which the price may test the USD 240 level. Bitcoin cash price is struggling to hold gains above the USD 420 support. BCH/USD must stay above the USD 400 and USD 420 supports to bounce back. If not, there is a risk of more losses towards the USD 380 level in the near term. On the upside, a break above USD 440 is needed for a decent recovery.
Ripple price is currently correcting lower below the USD 0.330 level. XRP/USD could continue to move down towards the USD 0.320 support where buyers are likely to appear in the near term. There were mostly positive moves in small cap altcoins, including FUN, WAX, RHOC, MANA, DRGN, BAT, CMT, LISK, KCS, DROP, MAID and PAY. Out of these, FUN gained around 16% and WAX rallied 11%. Overall, bitcoin buyers successfully defended an important support near USD 6,100. If BTC/USD continues to hold the USD 6,300 support, there could be more gains towards the USD 6,440 and USD 6,500 levels in the coming sessions. Above USD 6,500, the price may possibly rally towards the USD 6,600 level.

1," Bitcoin’s (BTC) has made a high volume recovery from five-week lows, although a bullish reversal is still not confirmed, technical studies indicate. The leading cryptocurrency fell to $6,100 on Bitfinex at 18:00 UTC yesterday – the lowest level since Aug. 14 – signaling a downside break of the trendline connecting the June low and Aug. 11 low (lower edge of the pennant). However, the cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid just an hour later and jumped to a high of $6,550. More importantly, trading volumes on Bitfinex increased by 66 percent during the price recovery. While the persistent failure to beat the key support could be taken as a sign of bearish exhaustion, the upside is seen gathering pace only above $6,600 (Sept. 14 high). At press time, BTC is trading at $6,400, representing a 1.10 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  As can be seen, the big move higher witnessed during the 60 minutes leading up to 19:00 UTC yesterday was backed by a jump in trading volumes. However, so far, the follow-through has been anything but encouraging. Nevertheless, the strong rebound from $6,100 has established the figure as a key near-term support.  Bitcoin remains stuck in no-man’s land on the daily chart defined by the lower end of the pennant pattern and the Sept. 14 high of $6,600. As of writing, the pennant support is located at $6,225. A UTC close below that level would signal a revival of the sell-off from May highs near $10,000. On the other hand, a move above $6,600 would imply a double bottom bullish reversal. This scenario is looking increasingly likely, courtesy of repeated rebounds at the lower end of the pennant pattern. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

1," Bitcoin price found a strong support near the USD 6,200 support and later started an upward move. BTC/USD traded above the USD 6,300 and USD 6,320 resistance levels. However, upsides were capped by the USD 6,400 resistance zone. More importantly, a few major altcoins rallied sharply, including ripple, cardano, tron and stellar. Ethereum also recovered above the USD 200 level and is currently trading with a positive structure. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin price remained well bid around the range support at USD 6,200. BTC/USD broke the USD 6,300 and USD 6,350 levels, but buyers failed to overcome the USD 6,400 hurdle. The price is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) up around 1.2% and is trading above the USD 6,320 level. 
On the upside, a proper break and close above the USD 6,400 zone is needed for buyers to take control. If there is a downside reaction, the USD 6,300 and USD 6,250 levels are likely to act as decent supports in the short term. Ethereum price recovered more than 6% and broke the USD 200 resistance. ETH/USD even surpassed the USD 210 level, but the price seems to be struggling to clear the USD 215 and USD 220 resistance levels.
On the downside, the broken resistances near the USD 204 and USD 200 levels are likely to act as supports if the price corrects lower. On the other hand, above USD 220, the price may rally to USD 235. Bitcoin cash price moved higher from the USD 400 - USD 410 support. BCH/USD is up more than 4% and is trading above the USD 430 level. The price has to break the USD 440 and USD 450 barriers to gain traction in the near term. On the downside, the USD 420 and USD 410 levels are decent supports.
Ripple price was one of the best performers since it climbed around 20%. XRP/USD broke the USD 0.300, USD 0.320 and USD 0.330 resistance levels. The next major resistance on the upside is near the USD 0.350 level. Many small cap altcoins gained traction recently and jumped by more than 10%, including LINK, ARDR, MKR, DRGN and WAVES. The market sentiment seems to be favoring altcoins and there could be more gains in ADA and XRP in the short term.  To sum up, bitcoin recovered from a crucial support and a few altcoins rallied. If BTC/USD breaks the USD 6,400 resistance, there may possibly be more upsides in altcoins.

1," Bitcoin’s volatility was on full display on Wednesday when its price fell from $6,300 to $6,100 before shooting up to $6,500 – all within an hour’s time.  As of press time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at $6,422, up 5 percent from the day’s low of $6,117. The market did not waste time making its bullish move, scaling over 6 percent in less than 20 minutes to ultimately hit a high of $6,494, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Coincidentally, the move occurred within just minutes of a CBOE Bitcoin Futures expiration. Bitcoin futures expirations have been documented as having a turbulent effect on the price of the underlying cryptocurrency, so an increase in market volatility perhaps could have been foreseen. Bitcoin’s move today is more shocking than its usual volatility, as an important technical level of price support of $6,200 was breached, signaling bears were primed to drive prices lower. Evidently, that turned out not to be the case since it is clear demand still exists above the $6,000 mark. CoinMarketCap data shows that the total market capitalization for the cryptocurrency market rose to roughly $201 billion during the market uptick, up roughly 4 percent and $8 billion from Wednesday’s low.  At the time of writing, the 24-hour growth for other well-known cryptocurrencies is not quite as dramatic, although seven of the ten biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization have seen positive price developments. Cardano (ADA) is leading the pack, currently printing a six percent appreciation compared to Tuesday’s figures.  Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.

1," Bitcoin (BTC) is trapped in a no-man’s land between $6,200 and $6,600, technical charts indicate. A bear flag breakdown witnessed Monday was expected to yield a drop to $6,000 (February low), but bitcoin’s resilience spoiled the bear party. The leading cryptocurrency bounced off trendline support at $6,202 on the same day and has since risen back above $6,350, neutralizing the immediate bearish outlook. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,320 on Bitfinex – up 1.23 percent on the day. While BTC’s defense of the trendline support is encouraging, a bearish-to-bullish trend change would be confirmed only after BTC has moved above the Sept. 14 high of $6,600. As can be seen, the trendline from June lows (the lower end of the pennant) has worked as a strong support this month and is the level to beat for the bears. As of writing, pennant support is located at $6,225. A UTC close below that level would confirm a pennant breakdown – a bearish continuation pattern – which would signal a revival of the sell-off from May highs near $10,000. A breakdown, if it comes, could prove costly: the relative strength index (RSI) of 41.00 is bearish and well above oversold levels, suggesting plenty of scope for a price drop. Meanwhile, on the higher side, a move above $6,600 (Sept. 14 high) would negate Monday’s big bearish outside-day candle and confirm a short-term bullish reversal.  The bear flag breakdown on the 4-hour chart failed to produce a bearish move toward $6,000. More importantly, BTC has re-entered the flag pattern, weakening the bearish case. That said, the stacking order of the 50-candle moving average (MA), below the 100-candle MA, below the 200-candle MA, indicates the path of least resistance is to the downside. Further, the RSI is beginning to roll over in favor of the bears. So, it seems safe to say that prospects of a bull breakout above $6,600 are low.

1," Don Wilson, founder of high-speed trading firm DRW, said bitcoin derivatives trading in Asia hours is almost equal to the volume he’s seen in the U.S., something he says is an anomaly when compared to other financial instruments. In a fireside chat at the CoinDesk Consensus Singapore 2018 conference with Quartz’s John Detrixhe, Wilson discussed his observations on cryptocurrency trading trends and his view on the future for the technology. Referencing bitcoin futures trading data on U.S. exchanges provided by CME and CBOE, Wilson went so far as to suggest there may be demand for similar trading tools in Asia. He told attendees: “If you look at the bitcoin futures data from CME and CBOE, volume in Asia hours are almost the same wth the U.S. … Whereas in like foreign exchange, even for the Japanese yen-dollar trading, volume in Asia is significantly lower.” DRW, one of the earliest institutions that moved into cryptocurrency trading, launched Cumberland, a crypto over-the-counter trading desk in 2014, at a time when others such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have yet to officially roll out similar services. Explaining the initial idea of DRW to start a crypto trading desk, Wilson said it is rooted in his belief that crypto’s decentralization feature. “There’s the argument about bitcoin as a store of value. But, more interesting to me, is the usefulness of bitcoin. The ability of transfer values without a trust in the system is hugely disruptive,” he said. Last year, the Wall Street Journal reported that Cumberland had traded more than $20 billion worth of bitcoin, ether and other crypto assets since 2016. Wilson added that custody solution could be one key obstacle at the moment to a wider institution adoption of crypto trading as he sees that as a crucial stepping stone.  Elsewhere in the fireside chat, Wilson also commented on yesterday’s report by the New York Office of the Attorney General, one which saw the regulator releasing findings indicating several crypto exchange may be involved in market manipulation and the violation of state laws. While agreeing to most of the arguments made by the regulator, Wilson sees “one of the biggest problems in this industry is the lack of clarity from regulators on what the rules are,” concluding: “Such uncertainty could drive away innovative projects in the space to other jurisdictions with clearer guidelines such as Switzerland and Singapore.” Cumberland image via Consensus Singapore"
1," Although the bear run of 2018 - especially the past 30 days - may look both imposing and bleak, the days of crypto domination are hopefully not over. To retain a different perspective, we have made a comparison of the amount of bad news versus good news in the crypto space within the past month. However, it's nearly impossible to mention all the news, but the results show the general trend - regardless of price, crypto is a hub of positivity. In either case, let's start with the bad news first. 1. Possibly the first example that comes to mind is Goldman Sachs postponing crypto trading desk plans - although this turned out to be false, but the damage had already been done.  2. The news of ShapeShift, one of the best known platforms offering peer-to-peer trading of digital assets, introducing KYC (know your customer) procedures did not sit well with Bitcoin maximalists, who are now scared that privacy and pseudonymity are endangered. 3. Trouble loomed in other crypto exchanges as well: Star Xu, the creator of OKEx operator OKCoin seems to have had some sort of contact with the Chinese police. The amount of uncertainty surrounding this case has proven fertile ground for speculations and FUD. 4. Meanwhile, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, has met with criticism by the community after claiming that ETH will be worthless unless there are some changes in the protocol. This claim was followed by him saying that, “There isn’t an opportunity for yet another 1,000-times growth in anything in the space anymore,” which the community did not take well to either.  5. The platform connecting blockchain believers to teams that are building serious blockchain businesses Cofound.it has announced that it is closing down.  6. Russia may seek to cap crypto investments. 7. In August initial coin offering (ICO) funding has meaningfully slowed to a bit over USD 326 million. Last time ICOs raised less than USD 300 million in a month was May of 2017. 8. The worst news, however, were the prices throughout the past month. The crypto plunge has exceeded the dot-com crash of 2000 (again), which prompted naysayers to come out and show their distrust.  But while people are preoccupied checking coin prices obsessively, the cryptoverse has scored some significant victories.  1,2,3. Most recently, we wrote about three great news in one: the Winklevoss twins winning regulatory approval for their cryptocurrency, US banking giant Citigroup dipping into crypto, and the Vice President of the European Commission saying that “crypto is here to stay.” 4. Australia is also going forward in their crypto adoption: Two fintech startups have teamed up to let Aussies pay their bills using crypto. 5. Asian countries are not lagging behind, either. The Philippines are taking steps towards regulation as well: the country is looking to become more crypto-friendly. 6,7. Uzbekistan is already aiming for a high position in crypto-friendly regulatory environments, while Japan is giving another chance to Coinbase and other cryptocurrency exchanges.  8. An Iranian news agency claimed that the country has given the green light to cryptocurrency mining, with more crypto-friendly measures and legislation to follow. 9. Also, a Hong Kong company is set to issue 100,000 “cryptocurrency Visa debit cards” over the next two months, in what it claims will be a first for Asia. 10. Other financial institutions have not rejected crypto and blockchain completely. The world’s first public blockchain-based bond generated “overwhelming” interest, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia claimed. 11. Another banking giant, Morgan Stanley is reportedly preparing to offer bitcoin swap trading for clients, joining other top banks in a sectorwide effort to explore digital currencies, according to Bloomberg, who cites sources familiar with the matter. 12. Heavyweight crypto platform Bakkt announced that with their solution, the buying and selling of Bitcoin is fully collateralized or pre-funded. ""As such, our new daily Bitcoin contract will not be traded on margin, use leverage, or serve to create a paper claim on a real asset. This supports market integrity and differentiates our effort from existing futures and crypto exchanges."" According to Mike Novogratz, a former hedge-fund manager who is heavily invested in digital currencies, Bakkt might be the most important news in crypto this year. 13. And if you really don’t care about institutional adoption but would like to accept Bitcoin in your business, CoinGate and Lightning Network teamed up to help you. Shoppers are now able to pay with miniscule fees and get instant payment confirmations, while merchants can ship their goods virtually instantly without risk of chargebacks or fraud. 14. The National Assembly, South Korea’s parliament, has begun debating whether the government should overturn a ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs). 15. Are you still worried about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hedging on whether to approve crypto ETFs? The matter has not been forgotten: the popular US-based fiat-to-crypto exchange Coinbase is considering if it should submit a proposal for a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF) on its own, according to reports. Moreover, the digital asset exchange plans to expand its newly opened New York office  to 150 employees next year, from 20 currently, Coindesk reported. 16. ICO projects are starting to deliver on their promises, building their products, especially when they have secured funding for years to come. 17. One of the wealthiest football clubs in the world, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), is teaming up with a Maltese blockchain startup to launch a cryptocurrency for its fans. 18. Elad Roisman, the newly-appointed member of the SEC, becomes second pro-crypto commissionaire at SEC together with Hester Peirce. 19. Julius Baer Group, one of the oldest banking institutions in Switzerland, is reportedly acting as issuer for a cryptocurrency product.  20. Huobi Group, once the biggest cryptocurrency exchange platform in China and the world, expands to Japan via an acquisition of local exchange BitTrade. 21. Nasdaq has announced that it aims to acquire Cinnober, a major Swedish financial technology provider, that is bullish towards crypto and is helping institutional investors to invest in them.  22. Tezos, one of the top 5 ICOs of 2017, announced that its mainnet is finally live. 
______ Thus, if you’re an investor, the current low prices might dishearten you, but abundance of good news might be a good indicator that  crypto is not dead."
1," While we all know that true bitcoin believers like to “hodl” their coins, a recent research have helped to understand the real extent of pure hodling versus other uses like trading and spending. The research by weekly cryptocurrency publication Diar found that over one third of total bitcoin supply, or 55% of circulating bitcoin sit in wallets (with more than BTC 200 in each) that have never made an outgoing transaction. In addition, 27% of these wallets have continued to accumulate coins during the bear market in anticipation of the next leg up in the bitcoin market. There are also a few possible explanations as to why so many bitcoin wallets have never made any outgoing transactions.  Aside from the fact that some of those walletts are owned by the cryptocurrency exchanges (at least 3.8% of the bitcoin supply is held in 5 such wallets), the most intriguing answer would be that the owners of these wallets are die-hard bitcoin hoarders. It could also be that the private keys to the wallets have been lost, owners have deceased, or through other means have become inaccessible.  According to the article, over 87% of existing bitcoins are stored in wallets with more than 10 bitcoins (worth over USD 60,000 as of press time). However, these fat wallets make up only 0.7% of all bitcoin wallet addresses, indicating that the vast majority of bitcoin wealth is held by a few long-term hodlers. Further, when looking at wallets with over 100 bitcoins, we are down to only 0.1% of all wallet addresses. These wallets hold roughly 62% of all circulating bitcoins. However, according to Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis company, between 2.3 and 3.7 million bitcoins are considered lost, meaning that the circulating bitcoin supply could be anywhere from 13% to 22% lower than official figures (more than 17 million bitcoins.)"
1," Despite sharply lower crypto prices this year, crypto hedge funds appear to remain optimistic on the space, with existing firms expanding their operations and new ones being opened.  Founded last year by a former investment manager at Goldman Sachs, BlockTower Capital is one fund that has expanded this year, hiring additional staff and opening a second office in New York in addition to its Connecticut headquarters, a source told Bloomberg. BlockTower’s new hires reportedly comes from diverse backgrounds, including venture capital, startup incubators, and investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, Nomura, and Bank of America. Among the fund’s investors is the famous American venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Further, the article went on to cite data from the Eurekahedge Crypto-Currency Hedge Fund Index, which confirms that crypto hedge funds on average has seen a decline in returns of 52.9% this year, compared with the 54% decline in bitcoin. That comes despite the fact that many hedge funds are holding a variety of smaller tokens and altcoins, which have seen even heavier selling this year than bitcoin. The relative outperformance by hedge funds against the broader market this year suggests that the hedging and active trading strategies employed by some of these firms have been working. The Eurekahedge Index is an equally weighted index of 16 hedge funds with positions in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In 2017, the index recorded a 1,709% gain, with an annualized return since inception of 152%. Through July 31, there were 96 new crypto hedge funds and venture capital funds, an annual pace of 165, as reported by Cryptonews.com. This would surpass the record 156 crypto funds launched in 2017. More than half of all crypto funds currently in existence have launched in just the last 18 months, according to Crypto Fund Research, a research company. However, the research goes on to show that while crypto funds are the fastest growing hedge fund strategy by number, overall assets are still quite meager, compared to traditional funds."
1," Bitcoin’s (BTC) drop to five-day lows on Monday has likely emboldened the bears, technical studies indicate. The leading cryptocurrency traded in a sideways manner over the weekend, neutralizing the immediate bullish outlook. However, the consolidation was expected to end with an upside break, as the short-term moving averages (MAs) turned bullish on Saturday, adding credence to positive relative strength index divergence (RSI). Instead, BTC dived out of the trading range in the US session yesterday and fell to a low of $6,203 – the lowest level since Sept. 12 – indicating the corrective rally from the recent lows near $6,100 has likely ended at Friday’s high of $6,600. More importantly, the drop witnessed yesterday signaled a revival of the sell-off from highs above $7,400 seen earlier this month. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,250 on Bitfinex – down 3 percent on a 24-hour basis.  The bear flag breakdown seen in the above chart is a bearish continuation pattern, meaning the sell-off from the Sept. 2 high of $7,429 has resumed and prices could fall as low as $5,000 (target as per the measured move method). However, that target looks far-fetched for now. Nevertheless, with RSI at 34.00 (bearish and well above the oversold level), the bear flag breakdown could yield a drop to the August low of $5,859 in the near-term. The bearish outlook would gain more credence if BTC finds acceptance below the key trendline support, as seen in the chart below.  As can be seen, the trendline connecting the June 24 low and Aug. 11 low capped the downside in BTC earlier this month and is living up to its reputation as a key support today. That said, the probability of a downside break is high this time, as BTC suffered a bear flag breakdown on the 4-hour chart and created a bearish outside-day candle yesterday, putting the bears back into the driver’s seat. A UTC close below the trendline support, currently seen at $6,214, would confirm a downside break of the large pennant pattern and accentuate the bearish pressure.

1," For a small but growing community of users in the Palestinian territories of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, bitcoin has become a lifeline. Ahmed Ismail, a financial analyst in Gaza, estimated there are at least 20 unofficial “exchange” offices there dealing cryptocurrency to local users. Ismail himself helps 30 clients use bitcoin to purchase investments abroad, such as stocks, since there aren’t any local alternatives for putting money to work. One such currency dealer in Gaza, Mohammed, told CoinDesk over the past four years he helped up to 50 families a month purchase an average of $500 worth of bitcoin each to send money abroad or shop online. “Bitcoin, in their opinion, is cheaper, safer, and quicker,” he said. “Nothing works with Palestinian banks. Bitcoin wallets are alternative banks.” While Palestine is not the only politically and economically isolated part of the world where cryptocurrency is making inroads, it’s somewhat unique among these markets in terms of the drivers – and limitations – to adoption. For example, Palestinians do not face the kind of hyperinflation that drives Venezuelans, Iranians and Turks to hodl a digital currency with a limited supply, since they don’t have a national currency at all, instead using stable foreign currencies. But another core property of public blockchain networks is particularly appealing in the Palestinian territories: censorship-resistance. Anyone can conduct a peer-to-peer bitcoin transaction. Once the transaction is paid for, it can’t be vetoed by an intermediary. This would appear to solve a real problem for a population with restricted access to the global economy amid the ongoing conflict with Israel. Even supporters in the West have had their bank accounts shut down for sending money to Palestinians. “There is no payment gateway, like PayPal, for entrepreneurs to receive payments internationally,” Laith Kassis, CEO of the nonprofit Palestine Techno Park in the West Bank, told CoinDesk. “So here comes solutions on blockchain with private nodes.” (The local alternative, PalPay, predominantly serves Bank of Palestine customers rather than offering a gateway to global commerce.) However, an electronic currency can only do so much in a place where power outages can be a daily occurrence and even traditional banks sometimes struggle to transact with much of the outside world. While sending or receiving bitcoin may be frictionless, on- and off-ramps just don’t exist in the Palestinian territories. There’s no way for Palestinians to get their Israeli shekels, U.S. dollars or Jordanian dinars to online crypto exchanges since none of them work with local banks. Hence, they must rely on dealers as liquidity gateways, and that adds friction back in. One Palestinian tech worker told CoinDesk that when she tried to cash out a bitcoin payment from a remote employer, she couldn’t get a fair fiat price from dealers in Gaza because crypto prices were soaring at the time. As such, Saifdean Ammous, the Palestinian-born author of “The Bitcoin Standard,” is skeptical about any claims that the cryptocurrency currently offers a solution to his homeland’s economic straits. “If the people who want to do the transaction don’t both have balances in bitcoin then you’re just adding extra layers of conversion from their home currency to bitcoin and back to the home currency,” said Ammous, who is a professor of economics at the Lebanese American University. “That’s never going to be a sustainable solution.” Another non-starter, in his view, is the Palestinian Monetary Authority‘s publicly touted plans to create a national cryptocurrency. Ammous said it “completely misses the point to think of bitcoin as a payment solution that can be added onto existing monetary systems.” He added: “Rather, it [bitcoin] is its own monetary system and it will have its own payment solutions.” Plus, Palestinian communities revolve around local trust networks and physical assets like cash, because high unemployment and poverty rates create urgent daily needs. According to World Bank estimates, 21 percent of Palestinians live below the poverty line on less than $5.50 a day. In that context, volatile and illiquid assets are predominately useful for cross-border transactions, but not everyday ones. On the other hand, tech industry optimists like Kassis take a different approach than Ammous or Ismail by engaging with the PMA. Kassis’s Techno Park hosted its first blockchain boot camp the first week of September, with 29 participants ranging from students to entrepreneurs and government officials. By the end of the five-day technical boot camp, several developers were working on new applications. Representatives of the PMA have participated in the center’s educational programming. “The whole ethos of decentralized ledgers plays into the [Palestinian] community’s need to talk peer-to-peer, that will enable Palestinian entrepreneurs to do business internationally,” Kassis said, adding: “I think blockchain and fintech has a huge potential to change the dynamics of our economy and solve many of the financial constraints [by] leveraging the decentralization of the network.” Kassis said he hopes upcoming programs like the Techno Park crypto hackathon later this year will leverage Diaspora connections to foster local expertise for institutional payment solutions. So far, the Techno Park’s blockchain seminars at four universities across the West Bank have discussed government-sponsored pilots, enterprise crypto services provided by companies like Ripple, and initial coin offerings, in addition to bitcoin. “It’s all about bringing awareness and creating new markets,” Kassis said. “The younger generation is more knowledgeable about crypto, more than the IT departments at banks.” And even if it’s too soon for bitcoin to make much difference now, Ammous said he believes that in the long term it has great potential to spark societal change. Ammous argues that governments, including those in the Middle East, have been able to fund destructive ideas, such as wars, precisely because of their ability to issue unbacked fiat via central banks. “The key thing is that the more it [bitcoin] grows, the more it will deprive governments of the ability to print more money,” Ammous said, concluding: “I think, in the long run, this is going to be a very good thing for everywhere in the world, particularly places in the Middle East.” Palestine image by Dominika Zarzycka; Shutterstock"
0," Since our market update last week, bitcoin has continued to trade higher and is currently sitting at the psychologically important USD 6,500 level. Other coins have largely followed bitcoin higher, and we have seen stable prices and low volatility across the board in the cryptocurrency market. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
The number one cryptocurrency by market cap has seen a decent recovery since the heavy sell-off two weeks ago, when the price plunged from USD 7,400 to USD 6,100 in just four days. In addition, bitcoin has managed to remain well above the lows in the USD 5,800 area from June, a sign that the market has stabilized overall and that the bears may finally have run out of steam.
For bitcoin, the USD 6,600 level marks the immediate resistance to the upside. If that level breaks, the previous market top at around USD 7,400 would become the next major resistance area.
Also, interesting to note about the bitcoin market is that the ratio between short and long trades is still at an unusually high level, according to data from the Bitfinex exchange. As we have seen in the past, a high short-to-long ratio may trigger sharp price increases. Ethereum
Similar to bitcoin, the price of ether has also traded up over the past week, since reaching a bottom of USD 167 on Coinbase on September 12. Following that, the price bounced back, gaining over 15% on September 13 alone.
As demonstrated by the sharp rise on that day, the USD 180 level appears to be an area with significant buying interest, thus creating a floor in the market for Ethereum (at least for now). To the upside, the previous consolidation area between USD 275 and USD 290 acts as the closest resistance level. Ripple
The price of the XRP token has formed what could be an interesting double bottom formation on the daily chart, which is normally a bullish sign. Since reaching the second bottom on September 11, XRP has traded slightly up followed by a sideways consolidation. For the market to indicate a reversal to a bullish trend, a short-term break above the USD 0.37 resistance would be needed. Litecoin
The litecoin market has been stuck in a prolonged downtrend with only very small corrective rallies since May this year. Although the selling has become less intense in recent months, the market has continued to make new lows – the very definition of a downward trend used in technical analysis.
Judging from the charts, Litecoin should break above the previous high around the USD 68 area, followed by a low that is above the previous market low at around USD 50 - USD 55 until we can say that a reversal has happened. Until that happens, the technical outlook on litecoin remains bearish.   _____

0," It seems that Michael Novogratz’s analysis of the new Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI) chart is not the only indicator pointing to a possible end of the bear market in bitcoin.  One indicator used by technical analysts in the market now shows “oversold” levels, indicating that a rally could follow. The indicator referenced in an article by Bloomberg is the Williams Percent Range, often referred to as Williams %R, which measures momentum in price by identifying overbought and oversold levels with readings between 0 and -100. Over the past week, the indicator has shown readings in oversold territories, below -80, although that has risen slightly to about -70 as of press time. Readings below -80 on the Williams %R have historically been good buying opportunities for bitcoin. The last time the indicator showed similar readings, in early August this year, bitcoin reacted by rallying over 20% during the month (green circle). It is worth noting, however, that technical indicators are prone to give false signals, and therefore should be interpreted with caution.  On Friday, former Wall Street banker turned cryptocurrency entrepreneur Michael Novogratz said that he believes the market has now retraced to the starting point of last year’s “massive rally/bubble,” while pointing out that strong market rallies historically have tended to retrace to the breakout point. Bitcoin price chart last week: Meanwhile, Juan Villaverde, an econometrician and mathematician who leads the Weiss Ratings team of analysts and computer programmers who created Weiss cryptocurrency ratings, suggested that the next bull cycle is still in the making.  According to Villaverde, the first few months of the next bull cycle could be slow and choppy, however, ""the next crash is bound to wipe out at least half of the gains.""  ""But as before, early investors will still come out ahead. Even those who just HODL should be sitting on some fat profits,"" the analyst estimated."
0," The price of ether (ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, sank nearly $30 today, effectively erasing half of the 35 percent rally recorded last week.  At press time, ETH is trading across exchanges at an average price of $196 – down $28 and 11 percent on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk’s Ether Price Index (EPI).   The development came after what was a record-setting week for the cryptocurrency when it recorded its highest daily trading volume in over 12 months, most of which came from buyers. The surge in investor interest helped fuel a more than 35 percent rally in price from its weekly low of $167 set on September 12, to a high of $228 recorded just three days later.  The 12-month high in ETH trading volume proved to be a short-lived record, as it was surpassed by sellers today amid a broader market downturn.  At the time of writing, six of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are recording 24-hour losses above 6 percent, including the likes of bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC), cardano (ADA) and monero (XMR). EOS is leading the pack, currently printing a daily loss of over 12 percent.  Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency, is faring better than most today, dropping only 4 percent on a 24-hour basis. That said, its current price of $6,223 is within arm’s reach of an annual low near $5,800.  The risk-off sentiment currently plaguing the market will only get worse if bitcoin’s annual low is surpassed, as it will reaffirm that the bears are getting stronger in an already overwhelmingly bearish market.  Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.

0," The corrective rally in bitcoin (BTC) could gather momentum if key resistance above $6,500 is crossed on the back of high volumes, according to technical charts. The leading cryptocurrency witnessed a symmetrical triangle breakout last week, opening doors for a stronger corrective rally towards $6,800–$7,000. However, despite the bullish setup, BTC was rejected near $6,600 on Friday and spent the weekend trading in a sideways manner in the range of $6,350–$6,550. As a result, the immediate bullish outlook has been neutralized. Further, trading volumes fell to a two-month low of $3.22 billion on Saturday, putting a question mark on the sustainability of the recovery from the recent lows near $6,100. That said, the corrective move could resume if the cryptocurrency sees a high volume bullish break from the three-day long narrowing price range. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,490 on Bitfinex – down 0.10 percent on a 24-hour basis. As can be seen, BTC has charted a narrowing price range over the weekend. A break above $6,540 (triangle resistance) would signal a continuation of the rally from the Sept. 8 low of $6,119. More importantly, it would strengthen the bullish case put forward by last week’s bullish relative strength index (RSI) divergence and symmetrical triangle breakout. On the other hand, a break below $6,380 (lower end of the narrowing price range) would signal an end of the corrective rally.  Over on the daily chart, the bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MA) indicates the path of least resistance in on the higher side. So, the cryptocurrency is more likely to extend the corrective rally in the short-run. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

0," Michael Novogratz, a former hedge-fund manager who is heavily invested in digital currencies, called a bottom on cryptocurrencies in a tweet, however, the community does not completely agree - but does hope that the bottom is here. This is the BGCI chart...I think we put in a low yesterday.   retouched the highs of late last year and the point of acceleration that led to the massive rally/bubble...     markets like to retrace to the breakout..we retraced the whole of the bubble.  #callingabottom pic.twitter.com/EasTBYgjSj The BGCI chart that Novogratz references is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto index, which measures the performance of the largest digital currencies traded in dollars. Although it is still too early to say whether his prediction is right or not, the market did rise within the past 24 hours: Bitcoin is up around 2% as of the time of writing, Ethereum jumped more than 10%, while the vast majority of other top 50 coins by market capitalization are also in green.  Top 10 coins in the last 24 hours: Novogratz’s opinion on the current state of the market is not too widely shared, although this could be because the community seems to be losing their naive optimism. “I think he doesn’t know any more than you do. But I like,” said Reddit user u/Bayminer. “Maybe. Maybe not,” concludes u/DelfinGuy. Even the replies to Novogratz’s original tweet include pessimism: “History doesn’t always repeat itself,” says @fathead___. Veteran digital currency analyst, Willy Woo, had earlier written about his own insight into the current market situation: Nice live chart by @unchainedcap from their article on HODL waves. To my eye, that yellow band flattening to a level similar or below the last HODL wave signifies the end of the bear and the next period of accumulation, guessing maybe 6-12 months away.  https://t.co/extiWAwlG8 pic.twitter.com/mGB3VpVRCM This could go hand in hand with Novogratz’s bottom tweet as the market recovers from last week’s Black Wednesday - but the fact is, nobody can know until it happens."
0," Japanese internet provider GMO Internet has spoken about a mysterious Northern European cryptocurrency mining facility that it operates – claiming the average yearly temperatures at the location are an icy 0°C (32 °F). Speaking at a blockchain conference in Shibuya, Tokyo this week, GMO representatives talked of the company’s latest mining project – claiming they constructed the facility “somewhere in Scandinavia” (although they refused to specify where) in temperatures as low as -10°C. The company states that despite leaky roofs, the facility is now operational, and mined some 568 bitcoins (USD 3.7 million) by July this year – although it did not disclose how much it had spent on construction costs, electricity bills and other expenses in the same period. Meanwhile, GMO stated that preparing the plant provided a serious challenge, with frequent blizzards, ankle-deep snow, icy roads and heavy rain hampering the building effort. The GMO team has installed 15,000 ASIC mining rigs in two warehouses at the site, with the hardware’s energy consumption roughly equal “to that of 33,500 households.” Per Japanese media outlet Crypto Watch, GMO said they chose Northern Europe because of the region’s low temperatures, which are advantageous for keeping mining equipment cool. The company also cited the fact that Scandinavia has become a leading renewable energy player as a major factor, as well as low electricity costs. According to various analysts, the break-even price for miners is in a range of USD 6.400 and USD 8.000 per bitcoin and varies depending on the miner’s efficiency. As bitcoin hash rate — which measures computing power - is growing, so does mining difficulty. ""The increased hash rate means people are here for the long-term because they’re happy to just accumulate what they have, potentially even run at a loss,” David Sapper, chief operating officer at cryptocurrency exchangeBlockbid Pty Ltd. in Melbourne told Bloomberg last month. At the same time, “they do sometimes have to clear house and dump.” However, Genesis Mining, a giant cloud mining operator, had to terminate customers who are unable to cover their “service fee” because of low mining profitability, as reported in August. GMO considers itself a pioneer in Japanese cryptocurrency, and operates the GMO Coin exchange in addition to mining projects and its IP activities. The firm has also allowed its staff to receive a portion of their wages in cryptocurrencies. Last month, the company enlisted Borussia Dortmund forward and national team football star Shinji Kagawa to head its new marketing push."
0," News outlets in Vietnam are claiming commercial banks have decided to discontinue cryptocurrency-related business at the behest of the country’s central bank. The central bank recently issued a directive on cryptocurrency transactions aimed at “strengthening control” over cryptocurrency trading and online gambling sites. Per Vietnamese news site Zing, the likes of PVComBank and Vietnam International Bank (VIB) are now taking steps, by refusing all cryptocurrency-related withdrawals, transfers and card transactions. According to InfoNet, the move coincides with the country’s Ministry of Public Security decision to step up its scrutiny of IT enterprises, with an emphasis on policing multi-level business ventures, cryptocurrencies and online sports betting. The Vietnamese government has previously expressed a wish to create a comprehensive system of regulations for cryptocurrencies and fintech enterprises, and hopes to have this in place before the year’s end. Vietnam-based lawyer Duane Morris claimed on his blog this week that a draft bill may even be forthcoming in the next few days. He wrote, “Rumor has it that the first draft will be released shortly, possibly this weekend.” Enthusiasm about cryptocurrencies, mining and blockchain technology has been growing exponentially in Vietnam with population of 93 million, but encountered a major setback earlier this year when two large bogus initial coin offerings (ICOs) led to a huge public backlash. In the aftermath, the government vowed to regulate, with six ministries instructed to prepare countermeasures. _____

0," Having dropped back from eight-day highs hit this morning, bitcoin (BTC) price could be in for a bout of consolidation before further upside unfolds. The cryptocurrency rose to $6,596 earlier today on Bitfinex – the highest level since Sep. 6 – adding credence to the short-term bullish reversal signaled by the symmetrical triangle breakout earlier this week. However, despite the strengthening bullish case, BTC quickly lost around $200 soon before press time. As if writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,450, having printed an intraday low of $6,355 a few minutes ago. While the sudden price pullback could force investors to question the sustainability of the corrective rally, the short-term technical charts continue to show that the path of least resistance is on the higher side.  BTC’s retreat from the highs near $6,600 is likely associated with the bearish divergence of the relative strength index seen in the hourly chart. Indeed, the RSI has adopted a bearish bias, but it is premature to call an end of the technical recovery, as the major moving averages (MAs) – 50-hour, 100-hour, and 200-hour – are still trending north in favor of the bulls More importantly, the key MAs are capping the downside at press time. This leaves scope intact for a recovery to resistance at $6,800 (multiple daily highs).  On the daily chart, BTC closed (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA yesterday, neutralizing the bearish view put forward by the rising wedge breakdown on Sept. 5. However, the short-term MA is still sloping downwards. This, coupled with the bearish RSI divergence on the hourly chart could keep the cryptocurrency range-bound for the next 24 hours or so. It’s worth noting that technical recovery usually gathers speed after the short-term MAs bottom out – unless, of course, there is a major positive fundamental news.

1," Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) plans to offer its customers complex derivatives that will be tied to Bitcoin (BTC), Bloomberg reported this morning. The Morgan Stanley Bitcoin derivatives will push the investment bank in the running with its competition currently dabbing in the cryptocurrency space. According to a person familiar with the venture, Morgan Stanley, one of the world’s largest investment banks, is trying to create ways for its client to get involved in the digital currency market. Institutional investors have shown that they don’t want to actually own any Bitcoin but more so want to trade for or against the price of it. The US bank will deal with contracts that give its investors synthetic exposure to the performance of cryptocurrency, the individual involved in the matter told Bloomberg. The bank is already prepared to offer Bitcoin and plans on launching when institutional client demand is proven. Morgan Stanley investors will be able to go long or short using their so-called price return Bitcoin swaps. The investment bank will charge a spread for each transaction, the person said. >> OKEx Founder Released from Custody and Denies Fraud Many of Wall Street’s biggest banks are pushing ahead their plans to offer the derivatives tied to Bitcoin, despite the crypto market’s downturn in January. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) are also preparing new products that are tied to Bitcoin. Last week, there were rumors floating around that Goldman Sachs had abandoned its plans to build a crypto trading desk. This put the entire crypto market in a total tailspin, but two days later the bank’s CFO called the news “fake.” Once banks see a demand for products such as Bitcoin derivatives, they are more than equipped to start offering them. The question then remains is, when will this happen? Will it take a monumental rise in the digital currency to spark institutional interest again? We will soon find out.

1," Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, an insurance giant, and a widely respected figure in the space, said that crypto is not dead in spite of the current crash exceeding the dot-com crash of 2000.  “We’re going to see more widespread adoption, by both the private and public sector, of the blockchain technology and related technologies,” he told Yahoo Finance. History of the crypto market capitalization: El-Erian is also not taking the usual Wall Street approach to crypto, either, eschewing the “blockchain, not bitcoin” mantra usually heard from traditional economists. He maintains his opinion that bitcoin is best bought at USD 5,000. This is a reiteration of his stance in June, when he told CNBC that bitcoin should be bought at under USD 5,000. Back then, he said he saw bitcoin emerging as more of a tradeable commodity than a currency, but “doesn't expect it will get all the way back to USD 20,000.” Adoption is coming, but not as quickly as we would like, and not in the same way. “In terms of crypto, what we’re getting is the realization that adoption is not going to be as big and as quick as the proponents of crypto would like,” he says. “I think it’s going to be there, it’s going to last for a long time, it’s going to play a role in the ecosystem, but it’s not going to be the currency that a lot of proponents would like it to be.” Not everyone agrees with his sentiment. Neil Wilson, chief analyst at online CFD (contract for difference) and forex broker Markets.com, was quoted by Bloomberg as saying that, “it just shows what a massive, speculative bubble the whole crypto thing was […]” referring to the crash of 2018. Still, people who have been invested in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies over a longer period of time dismiss negative comparisons to the dot-com era by pointing to the Nasdaq Composite’s recovery to fresh highs 15 years later, and to the internet’s enormous impact on society. They also note that Bitcoin has rebounded from past crashes of similar magnitude. Moreover, Vice President of the European Commission, former Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis, said recently that “crypto-assets are here to stay,” while encouraging cooperation between the European Commission and the European Financial Stability Board (EFSB) or the G20 on crypto regulation. In either case, only 13% of financial leaders at more than 2,000 companies in more than 20 of the largest US metropolitan areas think that cryptocurrency will not become common for business transactions in the next five years, a recent survey showed. 87% respondents chose answers ranging from ""Not very common"" to ""Very common"", according to the survey. Also, the blockchain technology is currently placed at the “trough of disillusionment” on the Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies by Gartner Inc., an American research and advisory company. Additionally, according to the company, blockchain will reach the plateau of productivity - the end stage of mass adoption - in five to ten years. Meanwhile, Meltem Demirors, a cryptocurrency investor, Chief Strategy Officer at CoinShares, told Cryptonews.com that “long term, the biggest adoption challenges remain psychological.” ""We need confident investors who have long term conviction and a market sufficiently robust and diversified to endure lapses of conviction or faith. Until then, any sort of movement in the market will inevitably move price - and therefore, limit liquidity,"" she sain in an interview."
1," Just when you think you’ve seen it all, the dark web reappears to prove you wrong. Buying drugs, weapons and other highly illegal paraphernalia is practically old news at this point. But now, a marketplace called SadaqaCoins surfaced: it allows you to “anonymously” fund Jihadi, an Islamist militant movement, snipers buy buying them a 4x4 pickup, optics, or rifle . If the movie Four Lions was shot today, this marketplace would have surely made it into the script. The opening line of the marketplace is, “Never will you attain the good (reward) until you spend (in the way of Allah) from that which you love. And whatever you spend — indeed, Allah is Knowing of it,” a verse from the Qur’an which urges believers to help those in need instead of hoarding their wealth. The name comes from giving: sadaqah literally means “righteousness” and refers to voluntary charity. It is not obligatory and does not have to be material: according to some hadiths (sayings from the prophet), “a kind word and smile” can be considered sadaqah and the best form of it is “passing on knowledge.” SadaqaCoins, spotted by Benjamin Strick, an open-source analyst with an interest in privacy, blockchain, maps, terrorist activity, and conflict areas, moves away from this explanation and into terrorist territory: it is not only a way to directly fund jihad activity, but also a platform for “various projects from the Mujahidin, Muhajirin and Ansar, along with their associated financial requirements”, according to their site. It is eerily similar to Kickstarter for mujahideen, offering the possibility of either donating (currently accepting Bitcoin, Ethereum and Monero) or listing your own project. The marketplace has gone a step further, and boasts an official Twitter account. Their pinned tweet reads: “The SadaqaCoins Team is pleased to present a gift and service for the Ummah [Muslim community]. The believers now have the opportunity to advertise and support the latest projects. A considerable advantage (over other platforms) is that it our service is anonymous and secure.” I believe the site is authentic due to a number of reasons such as content on the group's Telegram and Twitter page. But more significantly, SadaqaCoins uses an elaborate system of itemized bitcoin addresses for each project. These are different to its overall donation address. pic.twitter.com/wj4nHYXv9x At the time of writing, its Bitcoin address, however, remains empty. ""This dark web 'Kickstarter for Jihadis' offers translations in German and Turkish. This should be an alarm to authorities as to the origins of Jihadi financing via Bitcoin from Europe,"" Strick stressed. As policing and counter-terrorism agencies increase their skills in investigating cyber-crime and cryptocurrency tracing, more investigations are proving that donations and purchases can be traced using data from the blockchain. Still, according to the Financial Action Task Force, the majority of donations for terrorist organizations is made in cash - don’t let the crypto naysayers tell you otherwise. And please don’t fund terrorism, with crypto or otherwise - that’s not the adoption we strive for."
1," The cryptocurrency market has been making history for all the wrong reasons as of late, most notably by recently surpassing the plunge of the infamous Dot-Com bubble in the early 2000’s. With that said, cryptocurrencies tend to make recoveries when all hope is seemingly lost, and today’s price action of the world’s second largest cryptocurrency, ether and many others is no exception.  At press time, several of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are reporting 24-hour gains above 10 percent, including monero (XMR), litecoin (LTC), and EOS. Ether (ETH) is leading the pack while boasting a 17 percent price increase. Further, the total market cap has edged back up over $200 billion, after falling lower earlier this week. Still, it’s too early to call any type of long-term bullish reversal in the market, but there are three encouraging signs cryptocurrencies may see much-needed relief at least in the short term. Until today, the price of ETH/USD had fallen more than 40 percent since September 5 and 85 percent from its all-time high north of $1,400 set last December.  Today though, tells a different story. Since the low of $167.32 yesterday, price has recovered more than 20 percent reaching a 24-high of $207.67, according to data from the Bitfinex Exchange.  ETH/USD Daily Chart  As seen in the above chart, the recent price recovery can be attributed to finding support on the lower trend line of a falling wedge, a bullish reversal pattern, in a historical support zone depicted by the green box.  Further, the daily RSI was showing bullish divergence, giving all the more reason for a relief rally to occur.  In order to provide confirmation of a larger trend reversal, price would need to close a daily, more preferably a weekly, candlestick above wedge resistance with a notable increase in volume.  A common method of estimating the breakout target of a falling wedge is to add the base range to the breakout point. Since the base range of this wedge is over $900, a long-term measured objective for price would be in the $1100 area if price were to break out near $230.  Many alternative currencies are built on the ethereum blockchain, so a strong recovery from ETH would likely translate to a recovery for others as well.  The future prospects for cryptocurrencies in general are heavily dependent on bitcoin (BTC) – the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Down 70 percent from the record high of $20,000 reached in December, BTC could scare the most seasoned investor. However, a closer look at the long duration technical chart reveals the cryptocurrency is silently charting a major bullish reversal pattern. Weekly chart  As can be seen, BTC’s recovery from the low of $5,859 in August established the first higher low pattern of the year, the previous low being $5,755 hit in June. Further, the recent sell-off ended at $6,119, meaning another higher low has been created. The trendline connecting the higher lows indicates long-term bearish exhaustion. Hence, there is reason to be optimistic as long as prices hold above the trendline. What bulls need now is for BTC to set a higher high by moving above the July high of $8,507. That would confirm a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and could yield a sustained rally above $10,000. Risk assets across the globe have picked up a bid in the last 24 hours on reports that the U.S. and China are heading back to the negotiating table. For instance, the AUD/JPY pair, which is widely considered as a risk barometer of global markets, is up 1 percent at press time. Meanwhile, the dollar index is down 0.24 percent. Clearly, investors are hoping that these talks would yield results, however, trade wars would end only if the U.S. officially drops tariffs. More importantly, the past experience suggests such talks tend to break down in a few days.  That said, the renewed hopes of the U.S.-China trade talks could keep the risk assets well bid in the short-term.  Further, Turkey hiked rates by 625 basis points today to save its stumbling currency and the move has pushed equity markets higher across the globe.  All of this will likely bode well for the cryptocurrencies as the investor community still considers bitcoin and other innovations as risk assets.

1," Bitcoin (BTC) is teasing a decent bullish move, having cleared crucial resistance a few hours ago. The leading cryptocurrency moved past $6,400 earlier today, signaling that bearish exhaustion – as indicated by Tuesday’s spinning bottom candle – is paving way for a corrective rally. Notably, the positive price action was preceded by a solid defense of the long-term trendline connecting the June low and Aug. 11 low and an upside break of the symmetrical triangle. As a result, the stage looks set for an upside move. However, caution is still the name of the game, as the bearish moving averages (MAs) could work as hurdles and complicate the recovery. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,450, having clocked a high of $6,490 earlier today, according to Bitfinex data.  The symmetrical triangle breakout, as seen in the above chart, indicates a bullish reversal, meaning the sell-off from the recent highs above $7,400 has ended and the bulls have regained control. Further, the 50-hour and 100-hour MAs are beginning to curl up in favor of the bulls. So, while there is a reason to be optimistic here, the downward sloping (bearish) 200-hour MA is warning the bulls against being too ambitious.  Over on the daily chart, the persistent bear failure to penetrate the lower end of the pennant pattern is finally yielding a bullish move. A UTC close today above $6,400 would further cement the short-term bullish case. However, as of writing, the downward sloping (bearish) 10-day moving average, is putting brakes on the price rally.

1," There was an increase in selling pressure on the cryptocurrency market during the past three sessions. Bitcoin slowly moved lower and broke the USD 6,250 support. BTC/USD is now trading well below the USD 6,400 pivot level and it could continue to move down. Ethereum remained in a downtrend and it tumbled to a new yearly low near USD 165. Other major altcoins like ripple, bitcoin cash and litecoin are also heading south. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price failed to stay above the USD 6,250 support and traded below USD 6,200. Later, BTC/USD recovered a few points and it is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) down 1.6% to USD 6,220. If sellers remain in control, the price could continue to decline towards the USD 6,100 and USD 6,050 levels.
On the upside, the USD 6,300 level is an initial resistance, above which the USD 6,400 pivot level is the next crucial hurdle for bitcoin buyers. Ethereum
Ethereum price was one of the worst performers since it moved below the USD 185 support. ETH/USD traded to a new yearly low and close to USD 165. 
It seems like the price may perhaps continue to decline and sellers could attempt to push the price towards the next major support at USD 150. On the upsides, resistances are visible near the USD 180 and 185 levels. Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash fell significantly and registered losses more than 12% to USD 410. BCH/USD broke the USD 450 support area to move further into a bearish zone. If buyers fail to defend the USD 400 support, there could be heavy losses in the near term.
Ripple price is down around 5% and it seems like the price is about to test the USD 0.250 support. If XRP/USD fails to hold the USD 0.250 support, the next target could be USD 0.240. Other altcoins market today
Many small cap altcoins declined heavily during the past few hours like BTCD, NAS, PPT, GAS, NANO, WTC, DGD, REP, FUN, VET, LSK, ZRX and PIVX. Out of these bitcoin diamond declined 15.5% and NAS by 15.3%. Overall, the crypto market remains under a lot of pressure, which may result in more losses in bitcoin and ethereum. If BTC/USD slides below the USD 6,100 and USD 6,000 support levels, there could be a solid rise in selling in the short term.

1," Bitcoin (BTC) could witness a minor corrective rally if the bulls’ persistent defense of key support leads to a break above the resistance at $6,400, technical charts indicate. The leading cryptocurrency suffered a downside break of the symmetrical triangle in the early U.S. session yesterday, signaling a revival of the sell-off from the recent highs above $7,400. Further, the bearish pattern bolstered the already negative setup, as represented by the rising wedge breakdown and the pennant breakdown on the line chart. As a result, BTC was looking likely to test $6,000 (February low) before the UTC close yesterday. Instead, it bounced back from $6,170 — the support of the trendline connecting the June low and Aug. 11 low — and closed largely unchanged on the day at $6,290. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,250 on Bitfinex and the trendline support is seen slightly higher at $6,180.  As seen in the above chart, the lower end of the pennant pattern – the trendline sloping upwards from the June low – is proving a tough nut to crack. This could be considered a sign of bearish exhaustion, given that the crucial support is holding ground after a 16 percent drop. That argument has merit since the cryptocurrency created a “spinning bottom” candle yesterday, signaling indecision in the marketplace. A UTC close today above $6,400 (previous day’s high) would validate the spinning bottom candle, opening doors to a stronger corrective rally toward $6,830 (10-week moving average). On the other hand, acceptance below the pennant support will likely accentuate the bear case. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

0," During the past few hours (UTC 08:30 AM), there were most consolidation moves in bitcoin price above the USD 6,250 support. BTC/USD seems to be struggling to clear the USD 6,400 resistance, increasing chances of a downside break in the near term. Similarly, ethereum remained below the USD 200 - USD 210 resistance zone with negative signs. Most major altcoins are trading in tight ranges with a tiny bearish angle. Going forward, the next move in bitcoin depends whether the price succeeds in clearing the USD 6,400 and USD 6,500 resistances. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price made another attempt to clear the USD 6,400 resistance. However, BTC/USD buyers failed to gain momentum, resulting in a rejection. On the downside, the USD 6,250 support remains a crucial barrier for sellers.
Should the price break the USD 6,250 support, there is a risk of an extended slide towards the USD 6,100 and USD 6,000 support levels. On the flip side, a close above USD 6,400 may possibly push the price above USD 6,500 in the short term. Ethereum
Ethereum price remained in a bearish zone below the USD 200 and USD 210 resistance levels. It seems like ETH/USD may continue to move down, and if it breaks USD 185, the next support is at USD 175.
On the upside, a break above the USD 210 pivot level is needed for a decent recovery towards USD 230 and USD 235 levels. Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash failed to break the USD 500 resistance and is currently down 2.5% to USD 270. If BCH/USD continues to move down, the price could test the USD 450 support zone. To recover, the price has to surpass the USD 490 and USD 500 resistance levels.
Ripple price is also down around 2.5% to USD 0.267. It seems like XRP/USD could continue to slide towards the USD 0.250 and USD 0.240 support levels in the near term. Other altcoins market today
Many small cap altcoins traded in a range during the past two sessions, including REP, MONA, LSK, BTCP, PIVX, ETC and NPXS. However, EMC and WAVES outperformed as they gained around 65% and 22% respectively. To sum up, bitcoin price is preparing for the next leg either above USD 6,400 or below USD 6,250. The current market sentiment is slightly bearish, but it won’t be easy for sellers to push the price below the USD 6,250 support in the short term. Similarly, ethereum may continue to find a strong buying interest near the USD 185 low.

0," Bitcoin (BTC) is being squeezed into a tight trading range with neither bulls nor bears having the upper hand, and a decisive move either way will likely set the tone for the next trend going forward. The $1,000 drop witnessed during a 24-hour period in the middle of the last week turned the tide in favor of the bears. As a result, the cryptocurrency was facing a risk of a drop to $6,000 over the weekend. Despite expectations, the sell-off unexpectedly ran out of steam at a low of $6,119 on Saturday. More importantly, the cryptocurrency has printed higher price lows in the last four days, signaling bearish exhaustion. Meanwhile, the bulls have not been exercising their buying power either, as indicated by the lower price highs around $6,400. So, it seems that the investor community is evenly split on the immediate prospects for the bitcoin market, leaving the cryptocurrency directionless. That said, the direction of the range breakout will likely play a big role in determining the short-term price trend. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,320 on Bitfinex, representing a 0.5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. Looking at the hourly chart, BTC is being squeezed between the two lines representing lower highs and higher lows. In technical parlance, this narrowing price range is referred to as the “symmetrical triangle”. A downside break of the range would add credence to the bearish pennant breakdown seen in the line chart and the rising wedge breakdown seen in the candlestick chart, with prices potentially dropping below $6,000 (February low). On the other hand, an upside break of the symmetrical triangle could allow a stronger corrective rally towards the 10-day moving average (MA), currently located at $6,660.  Over on the daily chart, the 5-day and 10-day MAs are trending south, indicating a bearish setup. The bears are also boosted by a rising wedge breakdown seen on Sep. 5. While either side could gain the upper hand going forward, prices are more likely to see a downside break of the symmetrical triangle, the hourly chart suggests.

1," American regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an immediate suspension order for trading in two Swedish cryptocurrency investment products over the weekend, claiming traders had become confused as to whether the products could be considered as exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The SEC is opposed to the use of ETFs as a means of investing in cryptocurrencies, and has attempted to ban them altogether from the United States market. A number of companies have been trying to find a way around the regulations, however, as many in the country would like to trade cryptocurrencies in the same way as conventional stocks and shares are bought and sold. One of the ways was Bitcoin-based ETN (exchange traded note) listed on Nasdaq Stockholm exchange, under the ticker CXBTF, as reported. However, now, per a statement on the SEC’s website, investors will now be frozen out of trading in XBT Provider AB’s Bitcoin Tracker One CXBTF.PQ CXBTF.PK and Ether Tracker One CETHF.PQ CETHF.PK until September 20 at the earliest. Although they are not listed on any United States stock exchange, XBT Provider AB’s products are both listed on a Nasdaq-registered exchange in Sweden, and over the counter (OTC) transactions are common in America. The SEC cited a “lack of current, consistent and accurate information” as its reason for action, and claimed “application materials submitted to enable the offer and sale of these financial products in the United States […] characterize [the products] as ETFs.” The SEC also alleges that “certain trading websites” are currently referring to the products as ETFs. ""During such trading suspension, however, a broker-dealer may engage in activities within the United States solely for the purpose of assisting non-broker-dealer customers with the liquidation of owned positions held as of the date of this order in a transaction (or series of transactions ending with a sale) effected on the Nasdaq Nordic or other trading platform located outside the United States or with non-US persons located outside the United States including the issuer,"" the SEC added.  ETNs are close cousins to ETFs (exchange traded funds), but there are some key differences. ETNs are structured products that are issued as senior debt notes, while ETFs represent a stake in an underlying commodity. ETNs are more like bonds in that they are unsecured. ETFs provide investments into a fund that holds the assets it tracks, like stocks, bonds or gold. Meanwhile, now all eyes are still on the much-discussed VanEck ETF that the SEC is expected to decide on by September 30."
1," Bitcoin’s (BTC) recovery from 25-day lows seen over the weekend has done little to alleviate the near-term bearish bias, technical studies indicate. The leading cryptocurrency fell to $6,119 on Bitfinex on Saturday – the lowest level since Aug. 14 – bolstering the bearish setup established by a sudden $1,000 drop witnessed during a 24-hour period in the middle of the last week. However, the drop to 3.5-week lows also pushed the intraday relative strength index (RSI) into oversold territory below 30.00. As a result, the sell-off has stalled in the last 36 hours, although corrective rallies have been shallow. Notably, the cryptocurrency’s failure to scale $6,400 in a convincing manner despite signs of bullish reversal on intraday charts indicates that bearish sentiment is still quite strong. Hence, the next big move is more likely to be on the downside. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,290, representing a 0.6 percent rise in a 24-hour basis. The rising wedge breakdown and the downward sloping 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs), as seen in the chart above, indicate the path of least resistance is to the downside. The RSI of 39.14 is also biased toward the bears.  As can be seen, BTC suffered a pennant breakdown on the daily line chart on Saturday, signaling a revival of the long-term bear market. Hence, prices could re-test the June lows below $5,800 in the next few days.  The bullish divergence of the RSI has set the stage for a stronger corrective rally, however, it is likely to happen only above the trendline hurdle, currently located at $6,420.

0," If you’ve been monitoring the cryptocurrency market on a daily or weekly basis, you probably noticed that the market took a big nosedive this week. This is mostly due to the rumor going around mainstream media about Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) putting a stop to its Bitcoin exchange desk—a rumor that the Goldman Sachs CFO put a stop to. The story originated from Business Insider. There are other speculations as to why the market dropped, but the overall consensus comes down to panic selling because the giant investment bank pulled its crypto plans. Goldman Sachs CFO, Marty Chavez, spoke out today at TechCrunch Disrupt and put an end to those rumors. “I was in New York yesterday, and I was co-chairing our risk committee, and I saw the news article,” Chavez told Tech Crunch. “It wasn’t like we announced anything or that anything had changed for us… I never thought I’d hear myself actually use this term, but I’d really have to describe that as fake news.” The CFO said that his bank is still considering how it will offer Bitcoin services to its clients. Goldman Sachs has been building a Bitcoin trading platform that is modeled on a commodities futures trading platform. This means that there is never any Bitcoin traded on the platform, but more the promise that the currency might move in the future. Chavez states that the next step for his bank is ‘non-deliverable forwards’ or derivatives. The exec explained that these would be over the counter derivatives. >> Robinhood Wants to Go Public—Trading Platform will Launch an IPO Chavez explained: “They’re settled in U.S. dollars and the reference price is the Bitcoin U.S. dollar price established by a set of exchanges, the same one that’s referenced in the futures contracts, and we’re working on that now because the clients wanted physical Bitcoin — something tremendously interesting and tremendously challenging. From the perspective of custody, we don’t yet see an institutional grade custody cases custodian solution for Bitcoin.” Yes, people. Even Business Insider gets things wrong too. Not to panic, Goldman Sachs isn’t bowing out of the crypto game any time soon. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© belchonock"
0," The CFO of Goldman Sachs, Marty Chavez, claims that the story about them postponing their plans for a crypto trading desk was “fake news” and that the bank is still considering how to do it, but that there is no timeline for it as of right now.  Talking at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference, he explained, “It wasn’t like we announced anything or that anything had changed for us… I never thought I’d hear myself actually use this term, but I’d really have to describe that as fake news.” Chavez further described that Goldman is working on Bitcoin futures and some other derivatives as their institutional clients are asking for it. As for physical bitcoin trading, he stressed that an institutional grade custodial solution for Bitcoin is first needed and they ""are interested in having that exist,"" but ""it's a long road."" A timeline, however, doesn’t exist. “It’s a long road and so I would just be speculating. Maybe someone who was thinking about our activities here got very excited that we would be making markets as principal and physical Bitcoin, and as they got into realizing that that’s part of the evolution but it’s not here yet,” Chavez explained. Meanwhile, the community is outraged that these ""fake news"" have helped to push the market lower. Reddit user u/SilverHoard writes, “People really need to be held accountable for spreading verified fake news. It's one thing to have a different opinion or make a mistake, but this is deliberate. And coincidentally just at the time someone takes out a massive and random short? It's fishy to say the least.” Others are angry at panic sellers: “The same people who scream about being in it for the tech and making a change in the world. The same people who cry we need to be decentralised and get away from big banks controlling us. These are the people who will sell at a LOSS the second some random news about an investment firm or bank is released. They want a decentralised global currency but hang on the words of these ""officials"" like some kind of Stockholm syndrome. Ridiculous. Relax,” writes u/xenzor.

0," The popular US-based fiat-to-crypto exchange Coinbase is considering if it should submit a proposal for a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF) on its own, Insider reported. Citing “people familiar with the matter,” the article said that Coinbase is currently in talks with blockchain technology experts at the giant Wall Street asset manager BlackRock about launching an ETF or other crypto related exchange traded product. BlackRock is the company behind iShares, one of the biggest issuers of ETFs in the US. According to one of the sources, BlackRock’s representatives have not yet given Coinbase any “concrete recommendations” on the matter. In the past, however, BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink has publicly stated that his firm’s clients do not want any crypto exposure, while even going as far as saying that he does not see any reason to prepare for the possibility of that happening in the future. With these previous comments from the BlackRock’s CEO in mind, it appears that BlackRock is not likely to be interested in becoming an issuer of a bitcoin ETF at this time. However, its team does possess valuable experience when it comes to launching ETFs, which Coinbase may be able to take advantage of, even by working with a different issuer to bring an ETF to market. The race to bring the first bitcoin-based ETF to market seems to be getting more intense by the day, with many previous attempts having already been rejected by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the regulatory body tasked with approving new ETFs in the US. It remains to be seen whether Coinbase will succeed with its ETF efforts in the foreseeable future. For now, however, all eyes are still on the much-discussed VanEck ETF that the SEC is expected to decide on by September 30.

0," The number of short orders placed on ether (ETH) reached a new all-time high during Friday’s trading session, according to data from the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex.  At approximately 10:00 UTC Friday, the number of shorts placed on ETH/USD, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, surpassed the prior mark of 202,854 to ultimately reach a new high of 208,689.  The new figure represents an 81.96 percent increase week-to-week and a 162 percent jump from mid-August.  The development follows an unfavorable week for the broader cryptocurrency market and ETH in particular. From September 5-6, bitcoin (BTC) fell more than $1100, accounting for a nearly 15 percent drop. In that time, over $40 billion was shed from the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies tend to follow bitcoin’s lead after a big move, and ETH was no exception. Three days ago, ETH was valued at $287 across exchanges but today is trading at $221, according to CoinDesk’s Ether Price Index (EPI). In all, the developments mark a more than 80 percent drop from ETH’s all-time high north of $1200, so it’s perhaps no surprise that investor confidence in ETH is at an all-time low.  When a short trade of this nature becomes overcrowded – as the new all-time high would suggest is the case – an astute investor has to consider the possibility of a “short squeeze.”  When short positions are stacked so high, a small increase in price could cause those shorting to close positions in order to avoid a losing trade. Since the only way to close a short is to buy back the cryptocurrency, it’s possible ETH could see a rapid price increase, also known as a “squeeze.” ETH/USD Shorts/Longs VS. Price  As seen in the above chart, an abundance of shorts failed to spark any type of short squeeze in June and July. At that time though, the longs were at a very low level, comparatively.  Looking at the data from a different angle, one could make the argument that short and long market conditions are more similar to that of last November and December, given the difference between the two is at very similar levels (depicted by the white line). What’s more, the relative strength index (RSI) is both diverging bullishly and printing low levels only seen in a few instances in years past. This suggests that the selling may be reaching an exhaustion point and that an upside rally remains a possibility.  While the idea of a short squeeze is comforting for bulls, it’s never a guarantee – and the lack of technical support levels below ETH/USD has certainly provided merit for the overcrowded trade.

0," Lithuania based cryptocurrency payment gateway CoinGate announced that they have integrated the Lightning Network (LN) payments system for bitcoin. It means that over 4,000 businesses actively accepting bitcoin through the CoinGate platform will immediately gain access to Lightning payments, to make bitcoin transactions faster and cheaper. According to the company, with LN payments, shoppers are able to pay with miniscule fees and get instant payment confirmations, at the same time enabling merchants to ship their goods virtually instantly without risk of chargebacks or fraud. CoinGate, a payment gateway for Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and 50 other cryptocurrencies, has been testing the Lightning Network integration with a group of 100 merchants, as reported. “We were pleasantly surprised when we came across tweets of our Lightning Network implementation at the Kasbah Bar in Oslo. You may have heard critics claiming, ‘you can’t buy coffee with Bitcoin’. Well, we’re not sure about coffee, but buying beer with Bitcoin within a second for zero fees is definitely possible in Oslo”, says Dmitrijus Borisenka, co-founder and CEO of CoinGate. Just @andread74 buying his second or third beer with bitcoin #lightningThis was a bit slower than the other transactions this evening, taking a whole six seconds before confirming. pic.twitter.com/ZKdcbiI4Db The post by the company further states the usefulness of the Lightning Network: “[it] introduces a range of benefits and potential use cases for Bitcoin, such as high-volume micro-transactions, high frequency and real-time trading without storing funds with third party exchanges, among others.”  However, the company reminds that Lightning Network is in its early days and more suited to advanced users and Bitcoin enthusiasts, ""but a huge community of developers is working behind the scenes on making it user-friendly and accessible to a wider audience"".  ""By implementing Lightning Network, CoinGate is dramatically reducing the technical barrier on the merchant’s side, essentially making it effortless, while users can enable or disable Lightning with a toggle of a switch,"" according to the company. The idea of the Lightning network is that transacting and settling would be done off-blockchain, so the fees are low and thanks to the implementation of smart contracts for security, the payments can be instant - no waiting time for block confirmation. Also, another important factor is its scalability, which is supposed to make it possible for millions to billions of transactions per second to take place across the network. After Lightning Network’s software lnd 0.4-beta version rolled out for the very first time in March, Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs, developer of the network, said that “Bitcoin enthusiasts have gotten excited about this, merchants are excited about this. It feels like we’re right on the edge of mass cryptocurrency adoption.” More good news Meanwhile, more positive news for crypto come from the cannabis publication High Times: it seems that they are accepting crypto for their current initial public offering (IPO) after all. Their representative Jon Cappetta told CoinDesk that the filing, stating that they would not be accepting bitcoin and ether, was made “to make the SEC [the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] happy.” “We're accepting [cryptocurrencies] as a payment option, but technically Fund America takes the bitcoin and ethereum,” Cappetta was quoted as saying. High Times, which has been a mouthpiece for the pro-cannabis community since 1974, had previously claimed that “with a magazine and online presence still going strong, many are eager to grab some shares.”"
0," If you haven’t checked cryptocurrency prices in the past 24 hours, you’re in for a shock: the market as a whole is down, many coins having lost at least 10%, but most of them often double than that. At the time of writing, out of the top 100 coins by market capitalization, even stablecoins have taken a nosedive. The community is struggling to explain this uncharacteristic phenomenon. A few main theories took hold of the community: the first is that the drop happened because of the news that Goldman Sachs is ditching plans for crypto. The second is that Bitcoin was being dumped on several cryptocurrency exchanges, most notably BitMEX.  Roughly half of this last $BTC dump's volume on @bitfinex was margin short sells after the iceberg at $6.9k was pulled: pic.twitter.com/dO5O8KSXTZ The third - and most prevailing one - is that this is simple market manipulation. Also, others are discussing whether it might be a bull trap, or a false signal indicating that a declining trend in a price of an asset has reversed and is heading upwards when, in fact, the price will continue to decline.  The manipulation theory brought out some interesting ideas: Twitter user @bechokoy_betts argues that “this is why decentralized markets don’t work in a sense.” Others argue that the volatility has nothing to do with decentralization, but that this volatility will drive out any possibility of a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF) approval soon. “How can we ever grow as a community or prove to the SEC [The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] or anyone the crypto market is safe? Think what you want, today’s drop is clearly market manipulation,” writes Reddit user u/cryptocrew72. However, the Reddit community is not so easily persuaded: user u/mrcartel708 simply says, “If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen,” to the approval of many others.  Still, everyone is a little uneasy in the face of the upcoming bitcoin ETF decision. This is where the theory about the Goldman Sachs decision comes into play: many believe that the market’s steep fall is in response to that, and that Wall Street is giving up on crypto. CNBC Television talked to experts about what Bitcoin’s next catalyst and whether the ETF still has a chance of happening. The biggest problem for Goldman, they say, is the fact that it would be hard for them to get institutional investors on board with crypto integration. Meanwhile, Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp., told Bloomberg that a lot of retail investors’ hopes for a bigger institutional presence were really being driven by Goldman Sachs: “This is just a negative, negative sign as far as liquidity goes.” According to him, the next key level to watch for Bitcoin is USD 5,000, while a drop below that threshold may cause losses to accelerate. “It will either rain tomorrow ... or it will not rain”  The second theory about crypto, especially Bitcoin, being dumped is the one that ties into both of the previous ones: no matter which reason initially brought the prices down, the dump likely followed as a result of panic selling, the community believes. However, those in favor of the manipulation theory believe that even the news of Goldman surfaced just in time to hide a dump by a whale, instead leaving the community to blame the market drop on Wall Street. Whatever the reason for the red market, people would like to know where the decline ends and whether brighter days can be expected. One of the most popular ways in traditional trading is through technical analysis (TA). However, famous crypto trader Ronnie Moas took to Twitter to poke fun at TAs, saying that, “on that chart BTC may even be overbought and poised for a reversal ... or maybe it is going higher ... or it will flat-line.” He explains that this is the same as saying, “It will either rain tomorrow ... or it will not rain.”  TA is like handing over your Autonomous car control based on the car's rear cameras. Other than just poking fun at the mental image of analysts scrambling around and trying to make sense of charts and graphs, the community is coming together through their sense of humor as well. “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything,” has become the new unofficial motto of the current drop - an appropriation of the recent controversial Nike ad that featured Colin Kaepernick, an American football player, and sparked a heated debate in the US. Another example is this gif, which pretty much sums up the state of the market right now.  Meanwhile, Tuur Demeester, a popular economist and bitcoin-investor, took a chance on Twitter to remind his previous forecast that new highs for bitcoin are unlikely this year.  In the same thread, he also expressed his negative opinion towards ether: Since I wrote this 2yrs ago, ETH retraced almost all of its gains vs. BTC. Ethereum today is bloated, centralized, with hardly credible scaling plans, while Bitcoin is more lean and robust than ever, growing in many directions via 2nd layer scaling and institutional adoption. pic.twitter.com/YNX4W3l7uf On a brighter note: the internet’s favorite joke crypto, Dogecoin, has overtaken OmiseGO and is currently the 21st coin by market cap. DOGE has lost relatively little: “only” 4.45%. Also, there is another way to look at the recent bloodbath in the market: Here for the tech, then for the money and finally for the drama."
0," Yesterday, we discussed an important resistance zone near USD 7,400. Bitcoin failed to surpass the stated resistance and tumbled more than USD 1,000 during the past three sessions. BTC/USD is down roughly 15% and broke key supports like USD 7,100, USD 6,800, USD 6,500 and USD 6,400. Similarly, there were heavy declines noted in major altcoins like ethereum, bitcoin cash, ripple, litecoin, eos, neo and ICON. It seems like the market sentiment turned bearish and the last fifteen days gains were trimmed in a single day. Meanwhile, a few main theories took hold of the community, who's trying to understand what's going on in the market - read about them here. Total market capitalization Bitcoin
The USD 7,400 resistance proved worth as bitcoin price reacted to the downside and declined heavily. BTC/USD sellers took control and pushed the price towards the USD 6,250 support. The price is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) consolidating gains above USD 6,250, but it remains at a risk of more losses.
On the downside, a break below the USD 6,250 support could push the price back towards the USD 6,000 handle. On the flip side, if the price corrects higher, it could face a strong resistance near the USD 6,500 and USD 6,600 levels. Ethereum
Ethereum price broke the last major support at USD 250 and traded to a new multi month low near USD 210. ETH/USD is under a lot of bearish pressure and it seems like sellers could push the price towards the USD 200 handle.
On the upside, buyers are likely to face a lot of selling interest close to the USD 240 and USD 250 levels in the near term.  Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash price trimmed most of its last week’s gain and declined more than USD 100. BCH/USD is down around 22% and it broke the USD 550 and USD 520 support levels. It is now trading near the USD 500 level with an immediate support at USD 480. On the upside, resistances are at USD 520 and 530.
Ripple price broke the USD 0.300 and 0.280 supports before buyers appeared near USD 0.265. XRP/USD is currently correcting higher towards the USD 0.288 and USD 0.295 resistance levels. Other altcoins market today
During the recent decline, many small cap altcoins tumbled between 20%-30%, including IOST, BCN, STRAT, BTCD, NPXS, NAS, WTC, BAT, ELF, GAS, NANO, GNT, DGB and DASH. Clearly, bitcoin and altcoins suffered heavy losses during the past few hours. The market sentiment changed to bearish and if BTC/USD fails to stay above the USD 6,250 and USD 6,000 support levels, there could be more declines in the coming days. More importantly, a close below USD 200 in ETH/USD may well put a lot of pressure on other altcoins.  _____

0," Bitcoin’s (BTC) double-digit drop has torn down the scaffolding of what had seemed to be a developing long-term bull market just days ago. That said, a bearish reversal is still not confirmed either, technical studies indicate. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,422 on Bitfinex – down 13 percent from the previous day’s high of $7,404. Notably, BTC has erased all the gains made over the last two weeks in a single day. Further, the sharp drop has poured cold water over the optimism generated by the falling channel breakout and the bullish turn of the weekly MACD. Still, it is premature to call a long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change, as the prices are holding well above the crucial support of $6,000.  As seen in the above chart, the bears have repeatedly failed in the last 11 weeks to secure a weekly close (Sunday’s UTC close) below $6,000 (Feb. 6 low), signaling the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 has run out of steam. Hence, the bears will likely feel emboldened if BTC closes the week below $6,000. One way to gauge whether BTC is likely to end this week below the significant support level is to study the line chart. This paints a better picture of the broader trend by focusing only on the UTC close, unlike the candlestick chart, which also takes into account the daily high and low.  As can be seen, BTC has charted a pennant pattern on the daily line chart. A UTC close below the pennant support of $6,340 would signal a revival of the long-term bear market. Thus, the probability of BTC ending the week below $6,000 would rise sharply on pennant breakdown. That said, the sell-off is now looking overstretched on the short-duration charts, and a bearish close is looking unlikely.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart is hovering at its lowest level since June 11, signaling extreme oversold conditions. A similar sentiment is being echoed by the hourly chart RSI. Hence, a minor corrective rally cannot be ruled out. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

Other coins followed suit, with many losing around 10% compared to the price 24 hours ago.  Total market capitalization: _______ Prices at UTC 12:33 PM Commenting on the sudden decline, CNBC Cryptotrader host Ran Neuner tweeted, “Brace yourselves for the ‘Bitcoin going to USD 3000’ tweets…” The community is worried: Twitter user @CryptoSantaAmit writes, “We've gone back 5 days in 60 minutes,” but others say to HODL on tight, because “This looks worse than it is,” in the words of @momotothek. Brace yourselves for the “Bitcoin going to $3000” tweets... pic.twitter.com/zL1DASbJDP Others are discussing whether it might be a bull trap, or a false signal indicating that a declining trend in a price of an asset has reversed and is heading upwards when, in fact, the price will continue to decline.  Before the drop, bitcoin traded further higher during the past three sessions and broke the USD 7,350 resistance. BTC/USD tested the next important resistance at USD 7,400 and it was consolidating gains.  And, as always, the crypto community took another opportunity to joke: Awesome... If it helps BTC bag holders who didn't sell in December, so they can feel better. 😎 pic.twitter.com/lMRbb7KnNa Meanwhile, Goldman has moved earlier plans to open a desk for trading cryptocurrencies further down a list of priorities for how it can participate in cryptocurrency markets, but the plans may be revived at a later point, Business Insider reported today, citing undisclosed sources familiar with the matter. This does not mean the giant is moving out of the cryptocurrency space for good: they are still working on a custody product for cryptocurrency holders, as Bloomberg reported last month. According to one of the sources, executives have come to the conclusion that many steps still need to be taken before a regulated bank would be allowed to trade cryptocurrencies - mostly outside of their control.

0," Bitcoin traded further higher during the past three sessions and broke the USD 7,350 resistance. BTC/USD tested the next important resistance at USD 7,400 and it is currently consolidating gains. To the topside, the USD 7,400 and USD 7,500 levels are crucial hurdles for buyers. Therefore, the next move depends whether buyers are able to push the price above these levels. On the other hand, there was a minor downward move in major altcoins like ethereum, bitcoin cash and ripple, but they all are still trading above key supports. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price gained more than 1% recently and tested the USD 7,400 resistance. BTC/USD is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) trading with bullish moves above the previous resistance (now support) at USD 7,350. However, buyers need to push the price above the USD 7,400 barrier and then USD 7,500. Both are important resistances for a move towards the USD 8,000 handle.
If buyers fail, there could be a downside correction towards the USD 7,250 and USD 7,050 support levels in the near term. Ethereum
Ethereum price could not settle above the USD 290 resistance and it slowly declined. ETH/USD is down around 1%, but it is still trading above the USD 275 support, which is a positive sign.
Buyers need to gain momentum above the USD 290 resistance for more upsides towards USD 300 and USD 310 in the short term.  Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash price remained confined in a tiny range above the USD 620 support. BCH/USD needs to break the USD 640 and USD 650 resistances to start a fresh upward move. On the other hand, a break below the USD 620 range support could ignite bearish moves in the near term towards USD 600 and USD 580.
Ripple price seems to be struggling to gain buying interest and it is currently down more than 1.2% to USD 0.328. XRP/USD could continue to move down towards the next supports at USD 0.325 and USD 0.323. Other altcoins market today
The market sentiment was mostly positive for small cap altcoins like dropil, STRAT and bytecoin, PIVX, MOAC, NPXS, GAS, MCO and PAY. Out of these dropil climbed around 17% and STRAT gained roughly 12%. To sum up, bitcoin price remains in an uptrend above the USD 7,250 support. However, buyers are likely to face a lot of selling interest near the USD 7,400 and USD 7,500 resistance levels. Should there be a close above USD 7,500, there could be solid gains in BTC and altcoins in the coming days.

1," Cryptocurrency enthusiasts and bulls have been hopeful that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will grant the first Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund) this year. However, these bulls have been left disappointed recently as the SEC has handed out a handful of rejections and postponements. Bill Barhydt, CEO of Bitcoin payment start-up Abra, told CNBC that it’s because the applications sent in haven’t fit the financial archetype that the SEC is looking for. “I think the issue with the SEC, quite frankly, is that the people who are doing the applications don’t fit the mold of who the SEC is used to approving,” Barhydt told CNBC today. The CEO states that he used to work for Goldman Sachs and made a point to address his clothing attire in comparison to how these ETF applications are being sent in. Many of the new tech start-ups and blockchain company executives have a much laxer work attire compared to those working on Wall Street. Barhydt states that he couldn’t just go into the SEC wearing what he’s wearing and expect them to accept an application for distributing ETFs. It has nothing to do with clothing, per say, but has everything to do with the reputation and foundation of the company applying to distribute bitcoin ETFs. So far this year, the financial watchdog has rejected multiple bitcoin ETF proposals. Bitcoin (BTC) futures were introduced back in mid-December, and many believe ETFs are the next vital step for transforming the crypto space into a mainstream industry. Abra’s CEO told CNBC that for an application to be approved by the SEC, it would take an applicant who “looks, feels, and smells” the way the SEC wants them to. >> Kingdom Trust Secures Crypto Insurance from Llyod’s of London “It’s going to happen in the next year, I would actually make a bet on it,” Barhydt said. “There is too much demand for it.” It seems the Abra exec is pretty confident in Bitcoin ETFs coming to the markets soon.

1," Bitcoin remained in a positive zone above the USD 7,000 pivot level. More importantly, BTC/USD made a few attempts to surpass the USD 7,300 - USD 7,350 resistance, but buyers failed so far. However, the price remains supported and it could soon make another bullish move. Major altcoins like ether, bitcoin cash and ripple remained confined in a range and it seems like they are preparing for the next move. ETH/USD must break USD 300 and BCH/USD needs to settle above USD 660 for more gains. Overall, the market sentiment remains bullish and there could be more gains in bitcoin above USD 7,300. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price corrected a few points recently, but buyers protected declines below the USD 7,180 level. BTC/USD is back above the USD 7,250 support and it is currently attempting to surpass the USD 7,300 - USD 7,350 resistance. If buyers succeed, the next resistance awaits near USD 7,500.
On the other hand, if the price fails again, it could slide below the USD 7,250 support. The next major support is USD 7,100 followed by the USD 7,000 pivot zone. Ethereum
Ethereum price extended its consolidation moves above the USD 280 level. ETH/USD seems to be preparing for the next ride, which could be above the USD 300 and 310 levels.
On the downside, the USD 280 level is an initial support. However, the most important support is USD 275, below which buyers are likely to struggle.  Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash price stayed above the USD 620 support and traded mostly in a range. BCH/USD seems to be facing key resistances at USD 650 and USD 660. Above these, the price is likely to test the USD 700 level. On the downside, below USD 620, the next supports is USD 600.
Ripple price is slowly moving down and is currently trading below the USD 0.335 level. If XRP/USD sellers push the price below the USD 0.330 support, there could be more losses in the near term towards USD 0.322. Other altcoins market today
Today, many small cap altcoins rallied and gained more than 10%, including holo, komodo, monero, NPXS, OMG, STRAT, dropil, RDD, MITH and VET. Overall, bitcoin buyers remain in control above the USD 7,000 pivot level. There could be a few swing moves in BTC/USD, but as long as the price is above USD 7,000, there may possibly be more upsides towards the USD 7,500 level. Similarly, ETH/USD could rise if it continues to stay above the USD 275 support. _____

1," The list of indicators signaling a long-term bullish reversal in bitcoin (BTC) continues to grow with each passing week. The latest to join the list is the MACD histogram, which has moved above zero – turned bullish – for the first time since January. The MACD, which oscillates above and below the zero line, is one of the most popular technical indicators used to determine a trend’s reversal and momentum. A bearish-to-bullish trend change is confirmed when the histogram moves above the zero line. On the other hand, a bearish reversal is confirmed when it dips below zero. The bullish turn of the MACD adds credence to BTC’s strong defense of the psychological support of $6,000 in the last 10 weeks. Further, it validates bearish exhaustion indicated by BTC’s long-tailed monthly candle and the record low net shorts in the BTC futures market. At press time, BTC is trading at $7,320 on Bitfinex, representing a 0.8 percent appreciation on a 24-hour basis.  As seen in the chart above, the histogram has moved above the zero line for the first time since January. More importantly, the bullish turn in the MACD is accompanied by a falling channel breakout (bullish pattern). So, it seems safe to say that the outlook as per the weekly chart is bullish. As a result, BTC could explore the upside towards the July highs above $8,500 in the next few weeks. While the long-term picture is looking rosy, the cryptocurrency could drop to $7,000 (psychological support) in the next day or two, if the wedge pattern seen in the chart below ends with a downside break.  The rising trendline has been breached, so BTC could dip below the wedge support of $7,230 in the next few hours. On the other hand, a high volume bullish breakout would signal a continuation of the rally from the August low of $5,859. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

1," Initial coin offering advisory firm Satis Group predicts Bitcoin’s price could reach USD 144,000 within the next decade and USD 96,000 in half that time, but the crypto community is getting less gullible. “Someone with a bias makes a guess,” is how Reddit user u/bahkins313 sums up the reaction from the rest of the community. These predictions were reached by starting at the assumption that the more tokens are in circulation, the less their value. The research also estimates a constant increase in price, but claims “conservative” estimates in general. In short, it relies on a price prediction based on underlying value rather than speculation. “Cryptoassets which apply unique value propositions within deep and viral markets” should spike, and these include Bitcoin, Monero and Decred among others, while Bcash will drop as it is a “cryptoasset which attempts to inherit brand recognition and provide minimal technological advantage to incumbents.” The prices that should see the biggest drop, according to the document, are Stellar, Ripple and Cardano; Monero is estimated to reach close to USD 40,000 within the decade, and Ethereum should see about a double increase in price, but neither a spike nor a drop like the others. The crypto community sarcastically calls this a “Monero shill” and generally consider it “a**talkery.” On Twitter, user @Mr_Rupee says, “The good part of making 10 year prediction is no one will remember to question you after 10 years....” Of course, there are always those shilling their own coins that they claim will replace existing ones. Some people simply call Satis Group “scammers.” Twitter user @0xPineapple writes, “No one has ever successfully applied quantity theory of money to cryptoassets and shown meaningful real world correlation. I suppose it could be an instructive thought exercise in the absence of proven frameworks. Are these guys pivoting away from ICO services?”, while @njderuiter says, “@SatisGroup is the same group that claimed 80% of ICOs were scams. Nobody bothered to check their flawed research, where factors they chose to define whether something would be labelled as such were either extremely vague, or simply ridiculous. But hey, it fits the narrative!” Still, Satis Group is hardly the only one with bullish predictions. Tim Draper, famous early investor in groundbreaking projects such as the internet, Tesla, Skype and Hotmail among others is famed for his prediction that BTC will reach USD 250,000 within four years. John McAfee, a self proclaimed “crypto visionary” and software tycoon, predicted that Bitcoin would reach USD 1 million by the end of 2020, or he will eat his… private parts. Tom Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, is more conservative, but still estimates BTC may go above USD 20,000 by the end of this year, while Phillip Nunn, a high-profile blockchain consultant, online influencer and popular public speaker, estimated that the end of the year will see BTC at USD 60,000.

The price rebounded and moved back above the USD 6,900 level. Major altcoins like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and litecoin also corrected lower and are currently consolidating in a range. Going forward, if bitcoin price climbs back above USD 7,000 and USD 7,080, there could be more upsides in the near term. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price declined below the USD 7,000 and USD 6,900 levels. However, BTC/USD held an important support area at USD 6,800 (the previous resistance) and bounced back.  Buyers remained in control and pushed the price back above USD 6,900 and USD 6,950.
On the upside, an initial resistance is USD 7,020, above which the price could face sellers near USD 7,080. Finally, a break above USD 7,080 will most likely clear the path for a fresh weekly high above the USD 7,150 level. Ethereum
Ethereum price declined below the USD 275 support and tested the USD 270 level. Later, ETH/USD recovered and is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) trading near the USD 280 level.

As long as BTC/USD is above this support, the price may slowly rise towards the USD 7,080 and USD 7,150 levels. On the other hand, ethereum may continue to struggle unless buyers push the price above the USD 300 level.

1," Bitcoin (BTC) is all set to end August with double digit-losses, but a closer look at the price action suggest better times lie ahead for the leading cryptocurrency. At time of writing, BTC is trading at $6,940 – down 10.7 percent from the month’s opening price of $7,727, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. However, losses would have been much bigger had prices not recovered from the six-week lows below $5,900 seen on Aug. 14. Indeed, the bitcoin market has witnessed a solid two-way business this month. Sellers dominated the first half as the markets reacted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) disapproval of a Winklevoss bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in late July. However, by mid-August, the bears had run out of steam and the technical charts were calling for a corrective rally. Accordingly, BTC picked up a bid and moved above $6,400 in the third week. Notably, the short-term bullish reversal signals gained more credence after the cryptocurrency shrugged off the SEC’s rejection of nine other ETF proposals on Aug. 22. Further, BTC/USD short positions in the futures market hit record lows, signaling the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 set in December likely ended around the psychological support of $6,000. Consequently, the emboldened bulls pushed BTC to highs above $7,000 earlier this week. So, while BTC is reporting a 10 percent monthly loss overall, the technical charts indicate there is a reason to be optimistic going forward.  As seen in the above chart (prices as per Bitfinex), a long wick (tail) is attached to the current monthly candle, which is widely considered a sign of trend weakness – that is, the bears failed in their attempt to push prices back to the June low of $5,755 and the bulls regained some lost ground. Further, the bears have failed three times in the last 10 weeks to keep the cryptocurrency below the support at $6,000. So, it seems safe to say the cryptocurrency has likely charted a long-term bottom around $6,000 and hence prices could revisit July highs above $8,500 in the next month or two.

BTC/USD traded below the USD 7,000 level, but it remains well bid near the USD 6,900 and USD 6,800 supports. Similarly, major altcoins like ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash retreated from weekly highs and are consolidating above important support levels. Going forward, there could be ranging moves in bitcoin and altcoins before buyers take control again. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price corrected lower and declined around 1.5% to USD 6,950. BTC/USD may decline further towards the next support at USD 6,900, below which the most important support is USD 6,800 (the previous resistance and a pivot zone).
Therefore, dips from the current levels towards the USD 6,800 support are likely to find a strong buying interest. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the USD 7,050 level. Above this, the price could make another attempt to surpass the USD 7,130 - USD 7,150 resistance. Ethereum
Ethereum price struggled a lot during the past two sessions and is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) down around 3%. ETH/USD is slowly declining toward the USD 280 support, which is a crucial zone for both sellers and buyers.
If the price fails to hold the USD 280 support, it might extend losses towards the USD 275 and USD 270 levels. On the upside, resistances are aligned near USD 288, USD 290 and USD 298.  Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash price remained stable above the USD 540 support and is currently trading in a range. BCH/USD must break the USD 570 resistance for a fresh upward move towards USD 600. On the other hand, a close below USD 540 may perhaps push the price back in a bearish zone.
Ripple price trimmed most of its gains and is currently down more than 3.5% to USD 0.331. The immediate support is USD 0.330, below which the price is likely to test the USD 0.320 support. Other altcoins market today
Most small cap altcoins corrected lower during the past two sessions, including nano, IOTA, ONT, LINK, IOST, NPXS, BCN, WAN and ELF. However, two altcoins, NOAH and DOGE gained traction recently and climbed around 41% and 20% respectively. Overall, it seems like bitcoin has started a short-term correction, but as long as BTC/USD is above the USD 6,800 support, it might to bounce back.

0," Russian enthusiasm for cryptocurrency mining appears to be intensifying – although there are plenty of risks still involved. As previously reported on Cryptonews.com, mining has become significantly less profitable in the past few months due to a range of factors, but this seems to have done very little to dampen the enthusiasm many Russians currently feel for cryptocurrencies and mining. The number of new companies created to mine tokens in Russia has risen by 15% since the start of this year, despite an estimated 90% drop in profitability. Earlier this week, the governor of the Leningrad Oblast (the area surrounding St Petersburg) claimed the province had opened a 4,000sqm mining facility kitted out with 3,000 units of mining equipment. The governor stated that the facility’s energy capacity was 20mW, and had cost over USD 7 million to construct. The development’s owners have claimed the mine is the country’s largest, and was built on the grounds of a former Soviet-era fertilizer factory that had stood vacant for 20 years. Meanwhile, CryptoUniverse, a Russian mining specialist that trades directly with Chinese mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain, has opened a sales office in Novosibirsk, Siberia. Per news outlet Novosibirsk Online, the company already has offices in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Irkutsk, and says it will now allow Novosibirsk-based customers to buy their mining hardware directly. Siberian electricity prices are among the lowest in the world. The federal district has recently seen a mine whose capacity could reach up to 120 megawatts thermal (mWt) open in Divnogorsk, whereas its infrastructure costs were expected to be around 3 billion rubles (USD 44 million).  However, in Ufa, the capital of the Russian federal subject Republic of Bashkortostan, police have arrested a 33-year-old man, accusing him of conning 14 Ufa residents aged 45 to 62 out of over a total of some USD 265,000. Per media outlet Pravda, the suspect claimed he was going to build a refuse processing plant and “fuel-free” electric generators – which could be used to power cryptocurrency mining hardware."
0," Bitcoin (BTC) bulls need to defend key support at $6,905 to avoid invalidation of the short-term bullish outlook, technical charts suggest. Having hit a peak of $7,139 Wednesday, the leading cryptocurrency is currently trading around $6,920 on Bitfinex – down 2 percent on a 24-hour basis. The drop does not come as a surprise, however, as the 21 percent rally witnessed in the last two weeks was looking overstretched yesterday. More notably, the short-term bull case would weaken if BTC finds acceptance below the 100-day moving average (MA) of $6,905.  BTC created a “spinning top” candle yesterday, which, when viewed against the backdrop of the 21 percent rally from the low of $8,507, likely represents bullish exhaustion. Looking ahead, a UTC close below the 100-day MA lined up at $6,905 would validate the spinning top candle and shift risk in favor of a downside break of the rising wedge. Acceptance below the wedge support would confirm a bullish-to-bearish trend change, that is, the rally from the low of $5,859 has ended and the bigger downtrend from the July high of $8,507 has resumed. In this case, BTC could revisit recent lows below $6,000. Hence, the bulls need to defend the 100-day MA of $6,905 to keep the short-term bullish outlook intact. That may be a tough call, though, as the short duration charts are pointing to an increased risk of further losses.  As seen in the above chart, BTC has breached the rising trendline in favor of the bears. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has taken out the ascending trendline support.

0," Bitcoin remained in an uptrend and extended gains above the USD 7,000 barrier. BTC/USD even moved above the USD 7,100 resistance and traded close to USD 7,150. Later, the price started consolidating gains and is currently placed above USD 7,000. Similarly, there were decent gains in major altcoins like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, EOS, IOTA and litecoin. The current market sentiment is stable, but prices may correct lower in the short term before a fresh upward move. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price accelerated higher and surged towards the USD 7,150 level. BTC/USD closed above the USD 7,000 level, which is a positive sign and indicating a bullish trend. If there is a downside correction, the broken resistances at USD 7,000 and USD 6,900 are likely to act as supports. 
On the upside, an initial resistance is USD 7,100, above which the price is likely to trade towards USD 7,200 and USD 7,220 during the coming sessions. On the other hand, a push below the USD 6,900 support could send the price towards the USD 6,750 support. Ethereum
Ethereum price moved slowly above the USD 290 resistance. However, gains in ETH/USD were limited and the pair even failed to test the USD 300 resistance.
The price is currently trading in a range above the USD 285 level, below which it might test the USD 278 support. On the upside, there are many resistances near the USD 296, USD 298 and USD 300 levels for buyers.  Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash price tested the USD 570 resistance before retreating back to USD 550. BCH/USD is currently holding the USD 550 support and it is likely to trade higher towards USD 560 and USD 570. On the downside, the most important support is USD 540 (the previous key resistance).
Ripple price traded above the USD 0.350 resistance and almost tested USD 0.360. XRP/USD is currently trading flat near the USD 0.343 level with key supports on the downside at USD 0.335 and USD 0.330. Other altcoins market today
Many small cap altcoins remained in the green zone, including HOT, ETP, MAID, dash, TTU, GNT and BCN. Out of these, HOT and ETP performed well with gains around 20% and 12% respectively. Overall, the recent rise in bitcoin price is encouraging, but it seems like BTC/USD could correct lower in the short term towards the USD 6,900 and USD 6,750 support levels. However, declines may well be limited and the price is likely to bounce back towards USD 7,150 and USD 7,220. _____

1," Bitcoin buyers finally had the upper hand as they succeeded in pushing the price above the USD 6,600 and USD 6,800 resistance levels. BTC/USD gained more than 3% and traded above the USD 6,900 level. Similarly, major altcoins like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and eos also traded higher and moved into the green zone. It seems like the market sentiment improved to favor buyers and once bitcoin price breaks USD 7,000, there could be additional gains in the near term. Technically, most indicators on the 2-hour and 4-hour charts turned positive, indicating more upsides in BTC/USD and altcoins. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price gained bullish momentum after it broke the USD 6,600 resistance and surged above the USD 6,800 resistance. BTC/USD traded close to the USD 6,950 level and is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) trading in a tiny range above USD 6,850.
The current price action is super bullish and it seems like the price may perhaps continue to move higher above the recent high and USD 6,950. The next major resistance is at USD 7,000, above which the price is likely to accelerate towards the USD 7,200 level. Supports on the downside are at USD 6,800 and USD 6,750. Ethereum
Ethereum price also followed bitcoin price and traded up around 4%. ETH/USD broke the USD 280 and USD 285 resistances to move into a short-term positive zone.
On the upside, the next key resistance for buyers is near the USD 300 level. If buyers succeed in clearing USD 300, the price is likely to accelerate towards USD 325 and USD 335.  Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash price was able to move above an important resistance at USD 540. BCH/USD is currently up around 3.6% and it is facing a strong sell zone near the USD 550 level. An hourly close above USD 550 may possibly push the price above the USD 570 level. Supports on the downside are at USD 520 and USD 500.
Ripple price performed well and climbed above the USD 0.342 level. The next resistance for XRP/USD is USD 0.350, above which the pair may break the USD 0.365 resistance. Other altcoins market today
Many small cap altcoins rallied recently and registered gains more than 10%, including dash, GBYTE, IOTA, gas, RDD, DGB, 0x, ETP, VET, neo, bitcoin private, ZEC and monero. To sum up, the recent rally in bitcoin above the USD 6,800 resistance has boosted the market sentiment. Going forward, if BTC/USD breaks the USD 7,000 barrier, it could really encourage buyers to push the price further higher. Technically, ripple and bitcoin cash are set to follow bitcoin more aggressively than ethereum. _____

1," There’s a little-known correlation that may provide some clues as to where bitcoin is headed next, according to famous bitcoin bull Tom Lee, who still estimates that bitcoin can surpass USD 20,000 this year.  Lee,  who serves as the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said that the performance of emerging market stocks has correlated closely with the price of bitcoin since the beginning of 2017. Comparing the two markets, Lee, speaking on CNBC, said that “both really essentially peaked early this year, and they both have been in a downward trend.” “When emerging markets do well, it’s because we’re in a ‘risk-on’ environment, and when it does poorly it’s because we’re in a ‘risk-off’ environment,” Lee explained, adding that he doesn’t believe bitcoin will rise until traders with a ‘risk-on’ mentality are back. Comparing the two charts below, a correlation can definitely be spotted, with bitcoin (bottom chart) peaking about a month before the MSCI Emerging Markets Index (top chart).  However, it could be argued that emerging market stocks have declined because their currencies have been in decline, such as the situation is with the Turkish lira. And as we have seen in both Turkey, and to an even greater extent in Venezuela, weaker national currencies tend to increase demand for bitcoin. While Lee agrees with this, he explained that the majority of bitcoin trading is not taking place in emerging markets, but rather in countries like South Korea, Japan, China, the US, and Europe. However, Lee now sees the markets finally turning to a point where both emerging market equities and bitcoin will be valued higher. Especially if the US dollar weakens going forward, Lee sees “big money and firepower on the sidelines” waiting to move into the crypto space, confirming his bitcoin price target for the end of the year. Meanwhile, Changpeng Zhao, founder and CEO of Binance, a major exchange, has also reminded the explosive bitcoin price jump in the H2 of 2017. In either case, it doesn’t mean that it will repeat this year, too.  2017 Sept: BTC price $3000, FUD / negative news abound.  3 months later: BTC price $20,000. _____ Watch Tom Lee discussing the Bitcoin market: Fundstrat's Tom Lee may have found the next leading indicator for bitcoin from CNBC."
1," Despite the push to get a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF) approved in the US this year, chances now seem slim, as little has changed since the rejection of the Winklevoss ETF. Speaking about the bitcoin futures contracts that the proposed ETFs intend to hold, Chris Matta, co-founder of Crescent Crypto Asset Management told Bloomberg that “the markets are small and the volumes on some of these exchanges are low, which makes it such that manipulation is possible.” “[…] That’s their major concern, and without having any sort of regulatory body stepping in and policing people doing that, it’s always a possibility. A bitcoin ETF will not start trading this year,” the crypto fund manager said. The only proposed ETF backed by “physical” bitcoins, the VanEck bitcoin ETF, is therefore widely considered to have a better chance at getting approved, given the fact that the market for “physical” bitcoins is much deeper and more liquid than the futures market. However, the decision on that ETF may be pushed as far back as February next year. As reported by Cryptonews.com, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will take a second look at its decision from last week to reject bitcoin ETF proposals from three US-based providers. The decision to review the rejections, that were made by SEC staff members, and not by the four commissioners at the SEC, appears to have been pushed by commissioner Hester Peirce, who tweeted that the decision is “stayed pending Commission review.” Hester Peirce, who was the only commissioner to vote in favor of the proposed Winklevoss bitcoin ETF, has over the recent months argued extensively for the approval of a bitcoin-based ETF. In a lengthy piece that explained her thinking, Peirce wrote that “I reject the role of gatekeeper of innovation.”"
1," The bearish sentiment in the bitcoin (BTC) futures market hit a record low last week, indicating that the worst of the leading cryptocurrency’s price plunge just might be in the past. The non-commercial futures contracts of bitcoin, traded by large speculators and hedge funds, totaled a net position of -1266 contracts in the week ended Aug. 21 – the lowest on record, according to the data released by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Friday. The futures data indicates that the speculators are the least bearish on BTC since the futures were first listed back in December. A negative total represents net short positions (bearish bets) and a positive tally indicates net long positions (bullish bets). The sharp drop in the bearish sentiment, as represented by the steady decline in the net short positions from the high of -1945 seen ten weeks ago to -1266, adds credence to the signs of bearish exhaustion indicated by BTC’s defense of $6,000 since mid-June. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,715 on Bitfinex.  As seen in the above chart, BTC printed lows below $6,000 three times in the last 10 weeks, but the drop was short-lived, that is, all three weekly candles closed (Sunday’s close as per UTC) above the psychological mark. So, it seems safe to say that for BTC, the path of least resistance is on the higher side. The short-term technical charts are also echoing similar sentiments.  The upward sloping 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs) indicate a short-term bullish setup. Further, the 50-day MA is about the cross the 100-day MA in a bull-friendly manner. The ascending trendline and the rising 50-candle MA and 100-candle MA favor a move higher toward $7,000. That said, BTC’s inability to cross the psychological hurdle of $6,800 over the weekend is a slight cause for concern. However, only a break below the channel support, currently seen at $6,600, would abort the short-term bullish view. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

1," If you count yourself among the victims of the infamous Mt Gox exchange hack, there’s good news for you: you can now file your rehabilitation claim. The filing can be done both online and offline by post, and the deadline is October 22nd, 2018.  Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee of Mt Gox, announced in a note that the online claim filing system is now up and running, but strictly for individuals: claims for corporate creditors will have to be filed at a later date. Users who lost their login credentials will have to use the offline method. This includes sending proofs to an address in Tokyo designated by the Mt Gox trustee.  A separate Q&A document says that, “The planned deadline for the Rehabilitation Trustee to submit a statement of approval or rejection to the court is January 24, 2019, but, at the current point in time, a definite date has not been determined.” Mt Gox online rehabilitation claim filing system can be found here. The process for civil rehabilitation has started back in June, when the exchange had been awarded permission for this act by the Tokyo District Court, whereas the petition was filed in November 2017. Launched in July 2010, by 2013 and into 2014 Mt Gox was handling over 70% of all bitcoin transactions worldwide, as the largest bitcoin intermediary and the world's leading bitcoin exchange, according to Wikipedia. Mt Gox announced that approximately 850,000 bitcoins belonging to customers and the company were missing and likely stolen, an amount valued at more than USD 450 million at the time. A few weeks later, around 200,000 were somehow found, and the exchange proceeded to sell huge amounts of cryptocurrency when markets were at their peak – many attributing the series of sell-offs to massive price drops."
1," Bitcoin stayed above the USD 6,250 support despite massive negative sentiment after yesterday’s US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejection news. BTC/USD declined, but it stayed above the USD 6,250 support and is currently correcting higher above the USD 6,400 level. Similarly, there was a decent support base formed for major altcoins like ethereum, ripple, EOS and bitcoin cash. If bitcoin price continues to hold the USD 6,400 and USD 6,250 supports, it could stage a solid rise in the coming days. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price stayed above the USD 6,250 support level and is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) rebounding. BTC/USD has already moved above the USD 6.400 resistance, which is a positive sign. Going forward, a break and close above the USD 6,600 level is likely to clear the path for more gains in the near term.
Above USD 6,600, the price may perhaps surge above the 6,800 level. On the downside, the USD 6,250 support holds a lot of significance, below which, the price might test USD 6,050. Ethereum
Ethereum price tested the USD 260 level and is currently correcting higher above the USD 270 level. If ETH/USD moves above the USD 280 - USD 285 zone, there could be a solid rise towards USD 300 and USD 310.
On the downside, an initial support is near the USD 260 level, below which, the price may well test the USD 250 low in the near term. Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash price is currently consolidating above the USD 520 level and it seems to be preparing for an upside move. BCH/USD has to move above the USD 540 and USD 550 resistance levels to climb further higher towards the USD 580 level. Supports are seen near USD 520 and USD 500.
Ripple price is slightly struggling and is currently trading near the USD 0.3220 level. A break above the USD 0.3350 level is needed for buyers to gain momentum above the USD 0.35 level. Other altcoins market today
Two small cap altcoins, THETA and CMT rallied today by 51% and 38%. Moreover, other coins like BCD, EMC, nano, PIVX and AION also gained more than 10%. Overall, the current market sentiment is positive for bitcoin above the USD 6,250 support area. If the price continues to move higher above USD 6,600, there could be solid bullish moves in BTC and altcoins in the coming days.

1," The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to take a second look at Wednesday’s decision to reject proposed bitcoin-based exchange traded funds (ETFs) from three providers, according to a tweet from pro-bitcoin ETF commissioner Hester Peirce. In English: the Commission (Chairman and Commissioners) delegates some tasks to its staff.  When the staff acts in such cases, it acts on behalf of the Commission.  The Commission may review the staff's action, as will now happen here. In the tweet, Peirce explained that the decision to reject the proposals from ETF providers GraniteShares, ProShares, and Direxion was not made by the commissioners, but instead by the SEC’s staff as a routine matter, and that the SEC’s four commissioners now intend to review the staff’s decision. In an official letter from the SEC, the secretary of the Commission wrote that the “[…] order is stayed until the Commission orders otherwise,” without specifying any timeline for the review. Important to point out is that all the ETFs in question this time are intended to be backed by bitcoin futures contracts, meaning they will not be linked to the market for physical bitcoins. On September 30, the SEC is set to announce if they will approve, disapprove, or further delay a decision on the much-discussed ETF proposal, which is geared towards institutional investors, from financial firm VanEck. So far, this is the only provider that has filed a proposal for an ETF backed by physical bitcoins, which is considered to be far more important. Hester Peirce became the crypto community’s favorite SEC commissioner back in July when she was the only commissioner to vote in favor of the proposed Winklevoss bitcoin ETF, which was rejected by a majority of the commissioners. Peirce later justified her vote by writing in a letter that “I reject the role of gatekeeper of innovation.” Today, the Republican SEC commissioner once again received praise from the crypto community for standing up for innovation. You're the best!  thanks for being a great voice to all of us in the CryptoCurrency space!  Cheers!"
1," UPDATE (20:00 UTC): Bitcoin’s trading range has now surpassed $160 for the day. The bitcoin market has gone comatose today with a key volatility reading hitting fresh yearly lows. The daily bitcoin volatility, as represented by the spread between the daily price high and price low (as per UTC), currently stands at $84 – the lowest level since July 9, 2017 – according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Back then, the spread was seen at $68. Assuming that this differential remains at $84 until 00:00 UTC hours, we can say that bitcoin’s daily volatility has hit a 13-month low Friday.  The reading is of particular importance for traders as the drop in the volatility is often a precursor to the big move in prices. For instance, the daily volatility jumped to $389 on July 10, after having hit a yearly low of $97.21 on July 8. On similar lines, the daily range spiked to $850 on June 10, after printing a low of $107 on June 7. The data gels well with technical theory, which states that the longer the period of consolidation (low volatility period), the more violent the breakout tends to be. Accordingly, we could be in for a big move in the next few days, possibly on the higher side as the technicals are biased toward the bulls and the BTC/USD shorts on Bitfinex are near record highs, meaning the cryptocurrency is vulnerable to a short covering rally. All in all, the bitcoin daily volatility has hit 13-month lows at a time when the path of least resistance for bitcoin is on the higher side. So, it seems safe to say a big bullish move is overdue. However, a break below the key support of $6,230 (Aug. 20 low) would invalidate the bullish view put forward by the technical studies.

1," The probability of a bullish move in bitcoin (BTC) has gone up in the last 24 hours. To start with, the leading cryptocurrency has remained well above the key support of $6,230 (Aug. 20 low) despite the ETF rejection, adding credence to our assessment that the cryptomarkets had already priced in the bad news. Further, the decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to review the rejection of the nine bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETF) could demoralize the bears and trigger an unwinding of the short positions. It is worth noting that the BTC/USD shorts on Bitfinex are hovering near record highs seen on April 12. So, there is a real risk of a significant short covering rally.  And last but not the least, the technical chart below indicates the path of least resistance remains to the upside while BTC is holding above the crucial rising trendline. At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,550 – up 1.6 percent on a 24-hour basis, having bottomed out at $5,859 on Aug. 14.  BTC continues to create higher lows (bullish pattern) along the rising trendline. The bullish crossover between the 50-candle and 100-candle moving averages (MA) also favors further gains in BTC. Also, an extended period of consolidation often paves way for a violent move, according to the technical theory. Hence, the bullish move could be sharp, similar to the one we saw on April 12, as the Bollinger bands (standard deviation of +2, -2 on 20-candle MA) have been flatlined since Aug. 11, meaning the cryptocurrency is lacking a clear bias for close to two weeks.

1," The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected nine applications for Bitcoin ETF proposals. The SEC published three separate orders yesterday, highlighting the rejections from the three different applicants. This ruling is a blow to Bitcoin bulls who’d hoped the products would have provided a breakthrough for institutional adoption. Last night, the SEC published its rejection of two proposals from ProShares, two from GraniteShares, and five other products from Direxion. The rejections come just one day ahead of the deadline stipulated for a pair of Bitcoin ETFs submitted by ProShares. Proshares was working with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ETF exchange NYSE Arca. The SEC said the proposals did not do enough to show they were “designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.” All applications denied were directly linked to Bitcoin futures contracts. The SEC said that none of the nine applications had enough information to show that the futures markets are of “significant size.” >> SEC ETF Delay “That failure is critical because, as explained below, the Exchange has failed to establish that other means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices will be sufficient, and therefore surveillance-sharing with a regulated market of significant size related to bitcoin is necessary,” the SEC wrote. In short, if the Bitcoin futures market is too small, the SEC fears it could be easily manipulated. Last December, the commodities trading venues CBOE and CME launched the first Bitcoin futures, but the daily trade volume still remains small. This isn’t the first SEC Bitcoin ETF rejection though. In July, the US Olympian Winklevoss Twins, who own the crypto exchange Gemini, were denied their Bitcoin ETF proposal as well. Unsurprisingly, the crypto market has dropped since the SEC ruling. At press time, the total cryptocurrency market is sitting just over $200 billion. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading below the $6,500 mark, and Ethereum (ETH) is just below $375. 98% of the coins within the top 100 cryptocurrencies are seeing losses this morning.

1," In a series of three separate decisions published on the website of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday, the community learned that proposals to set up a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF) from three ETF providers had been rejected. Despite this decision was expected, the price of bitcoin still reacted by trading lower overnight, essentially falling back to the level from before Wednesday’s short squeeze. The three ETF providers in question are GraniteShares, ProShares, and Direxion, all well-established providers of ETFs in the US. Each of them had filed proposals for several funds, offering both long and short exposure to the price of bitcoin. Important to point out is that all of the funds rejected were intended to be backed by bitcoin futures contracts, without holding any physical bitcoins. Considering the SECs past objections to these types of funds, it was already largely expected that these proposals would be rejected. A bitcoin futures-backed ETF would have no direct link to the underlying market for physical bitcoins, and the community is divided, discussing how an ETF could affect the Bitcoin ecosystem and what harm it might cause. On September 30, the SEC is set to announce if they will approve, disapprove, or further delay a decision on the much-discussed ETF proposal, which is geared towards institutional investors, from financial firm VanEck. So far, this is the only provider that has filed a proposal for an ETF backed by physical bitcoins, which is considered to be far more important. It is widely expected that the SEC will delay that decision until early 2019. Previously, the president of the Chicago Board Options Exchange said that a bitcoin ETF faces what can best be described as a “chicken-and-egg problem.” He explained that the SEC has rejected bitcoin ETFs because the bitcoin futures market is not a “market of significant size.” However, the best way increase trading volumes in the market would be to introduce an ETF based on it."
1," Tanzeel Akhtar is an independent British journalist whose work has been published in The Wall Street Journal, CNBC, FT Alphaville, Investing.com, Forbes, Euromoney and Citywire. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are having a hard time clearing the bar in the U.S., where nine applications were rejected by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yesterday. The SEC is now moving to review the decisions. Commissioner Hester Peirce tweeted: “In English: the Commission (Chairman and Commissioners) delegates some tasks to its staff. When the staff acts in such cases, it acts on behalf of the Commission. The Commission may review the staff’s action, as will now happen here.” If the products are ultimately approved, then the largest cryptocurrency by market value, bitcoin, would have likely seen a substantial price increase. For now, however, HODLers will have to sit tight and wait patiently with their coins shivering in cold storage a little longer. (The next major deadline is in September when VanEck and SolidX will have their joint proposal heard, though that deadline can be extended int0 2019.) In the meantime, though, that isn’t quelling speculation about how an ETF would benefit those who hold bitcoin as an investment. In a post on Medium from June, Ironwood’s Michael Strutton teases us some with his perspective on the potential of a bitcoin ETF, “If ETFs add 24 million U.S. investors, and the upward momentum adds 14 million from the rest of the world, then that adds $84 billion and $336 billion, respectively, to the market cap.” “Over the past six months, bitcoin’s market cap has swung from $326 billion to $110 billion. Adding $420 billion to the market cap could put bitcoin’s price range from $26,000 to $44,000,” he continued. The estimates, while just estimates, still showcase an underlying belief that an ETF will provide a boost for investors. Still, from yesterday’s market movements, it’s clear the opposite is true. Crypto prices are hypersensitive to government regulation and it came as no shock when prices tumbled last night as news broke that the SEC had rejected the applications. With so much capital at risk, the SEC has been fairly clear about its stance and the regulator is right to express concern about fraud and manipulation of bitcoin markets. It is important to spend an enormous amount of effort cataloguing the potential risks from all angles before approving a bitcoin ETF. However, crypto fans should not take the SEC’s decision personally. There is the need for a professional-grade market which has the liquidity and depth to support the hedging activities of a U.S.-based bitcoin ETF issuer. For perspective, it helps to take a step back and look at the U.S. ETFs market in general. Once-upon-a-time, new and exotic ETF products were always first to be launched in the U.S., with Europe and Asia propelled by the American market. After years of unbridled growth, the introduction of new ETFs have been running into hurdles as regulators within the securities industry crackdown. Still, there are tasks that the technology’s evangelists can take up in the meantime. CoinShares, chief strategy officer, Meltem Demirors, made an excellent point on CNBC in August, when she highlighted, “The narrative around bitcoin is still really hard to grasp,” she said. “Really the only metric we have for most cryptocurrencies is the price, and price is such an imperfect metric. What does actual utilization look like? That’s really the struggle for crypto right now,” Demirors added. The regulatory community has put forth a similar idea – that time is on the side of innovators. As SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce articulated in an argument in favor of a bitcoin ETF, saying: “Bitcoin is a new phenomenon, and its long-term viability is uncertain. It may succeed; it may fail.” Peirce added that she doesn’t believe the SEC to be positioned for either outcome, but that could change with time, and with more clarity as to the narrative surrounding the technology. Why do most bitcoin investors want a Bitcoin ETF? Today, the most obvious reason is so the prices rise and investors can ride the high again like in December. We can bet regulators will want to have more nuanced reasons for an approval. For now, investors need to take a step back and assess the risks involved. The SEC has been nothing but clear and the language used in each rejection is telling. Back down, sit tight and be patient. The SEC has your best interest at heart. Typewriter keys via Shutterstock"
1," Bitcoin is teasing a minor rally today, having defended key support at $6,230 despite a string of bad news. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,400 on Bitfinex – down 3 percent on a 24-hour basis. Meanwhile, 94 out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are flashing red, according to CoinMarketCap. The risk-off tone in the cryptocurrency markets is likely associated with the US Securities Exchange Commission’s (SEC) rejection of several proposals for bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Wednesday. Further, it was reported earlier today that China, one of the biggest sources of demand for cryptocurrencies, is planning to block access to more than 100 overseas crypto exchanges. Still, BTC has avoided a break below the rising trendline and is holding well above the support at $6,230 (Aug. 20 low), as seen in the chart below, forcing us to consider the possibility of a rally.  The chart also shows the 50-candle and 100-candle moving averages (MAs) are beginning to rise in favor of the bulls. So, it seems safe to say that the path of least resistance is to the upside. Only a UTC close below $6,230 would weaken the bull case. That said, the probability of a break below $6,230 is low, as the SEC ruling has not caught the market off guard – that is, the investor community was likely expecting the commission to deliver bad news after its previous ETF rejection in July. Following that, the bitcoin price crashed more than 30 percent in the three weeks to Aug. 14, indicating the market was pricing in yesterday’s negative news in advance.

0," If you’ve been wondering how many bitcoins Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, himself owns, you're not alone - a new research by the BitMEX exchange has attempted to answer exactly this question. Despite they recognize that their ""analysis is far from perfect"", the researchers estimate that Satoshi had mined up to 700,000 bitcoins in 2009, or less than previously estimated a million of coins. The BitMEX research blog specializes in analysis of the crypto space. This time, their attempt at finding out how much a single dominant miner could have generated back in the beginnings of the cryptocurrency was inspired by blockchain researcher Sergio Demian Lerner. In 2013, he claimed that Satoshi had mined a million bitcoins in 2009. “Our analysis is far from perfect and we used a variety of methods [...] We will have made many errors and we do not claim our methodology is robust or scientific. However, as far as we are aware, this is the first attempt to allocate every block in 2009 as belonging to the apparent single entity or not,” the blog states. What they found was that up to August 2009, there is a pattern indicating a single dominant miner, but after this period, the pattern breaks down. However, this pattern could also indicate several miners with similar setups: “Each miner is not independent, in the sense that they are likely to be running the same software or could be using the same popular hardware, which could produce the same pattern.” There is still strong evidence of a dominant miner in 2009. However, the blog goes on to say that the evidence is “far less robust than many have assumed.” Also, it is quite possible that the dominant miner was not Satoshi at all, “although we know Satoshi mined block 9, which we have allocated to the dominant miner in our analysis.” In short, even if Satoshi was the dominant miner from 2009 - he probably didn’t go for a whole million, as “600,000 to 700,000 bitcoin is a better estimate,” according to BitMEX. However, even if the number is more or less accurate, it would be even harder to find out how many coins Satoshi owns now.  ""Whoever the dominant miner was, it is of course possible the keys have been lost or discarded by now,"" the researchers added.

0," Bitcoin formed a crucial support near the USD 6,250 level and bounced back. BTC/USD climbed above key hurdles near the USD 6,500 and USD 6,600 levels to move into a positive zone. The price traded close to the USD 7,000 level and it is currently correcting lower. It seems there was a short squeeze in bitcoin considering shorts positions were near all-time highs. Similarly, major altcoins like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and eos bounced back and traded above a few important resistances.  Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price gained bullish momentum and traded above the USD 6,600 resistance. There was a break above the USD 6,900 level before sellers appeared. The price started a downside correction and traded below USD 6,800. 
However, there are any supports on the downside near the USD 6,600 level, which was a resistance earlier. Therefore, if the price continues to move down, buyers are likely to appear near the USD 6,600 and USD 6,500 levels. Ethereum
Ethereum price surged above the USD 275 and USD 290 resistance. However, ETH/USD sellers defended more gains above the USD 300 level. The price trimmed most of its gains and is currently trading near the USD 285 level (UTC 08:20 AM).
It seems like the price is trading in a range above the USD 275 level with key resistances near the USD 290 and USD 300 levels. Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash price surged above the USD 560 level and traded towards the USD 580 level. BCH/USD is currently up around 4% and is trading near the USD 550 level. On the downside, supports are sitting near USD 540 and USD 520 level.
Ripple price spiked, but it failed near the USD 0.350 level. XRP/USD is currently up around 3% to USD 0.338 and it could bounce back towards USD 0.345 and USD 0.350 in the near term. Other altcoins market today
The recent spike boosted the market sentiment, which helped many small cap altcoins like cortex, WTC, KNC, NULS, nano, VET, AOA, RHOC, PIVX and populous. Overall, bitcoin’s price recent bounce is encouraging, but it would be interesting to see if buyers can retain momentum or not. If the price remains above the USD 6,600 support, there could be more gains in BTC and altcoins in the near term.

0," In a move that several market observers described as a short-squeeze, the price of bitcoin spiked more than 5% during a period of only 5 minutes in the early hours of the Asian trading session on Wednesday. The price later pulled back slightly, but has still maintained the majority of the gains from the sudden spike. Today’s short squeeze was by many already expected to occur due to the unusually high number of bitcoin short positions in the market. On the Bitfinex exchange, the ratio of bitcoin short to bitcoin long positions reached 1.4 on August 15, the highest level since November last year. Since then, the short-to-long ratio has continued to climb, reaching a high of 1.5 on Tuesday. Today’s spike in bitcoin prices, however, was accompanied by a sharp fall in short positions, indicating that the move was at least partially driven by traders exiting their short positions. When traders exit their short positions, often referred to as short covering, they have to buy back bitcoins in the open market, which can sometimes cause large price increases. And with the short-to-long ratio still at very high levels not seen since last year, the action may not be over quite yet. According to a Bloomberg interview on Wednesday, Timothy Tam, CEO at cryptocurrency data analysis firm CoinFi, “when there’s a record number of shorts, if there’s a large explosive price movement up like this, it means people will need to cover their shorts quite quickly,” adding that “it’s almost like a domino effect.”"
0," With the next deadline for a decision on a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) looming around the corner, let’s take a closer look at what an ETF could mean for the bitcoin market and why the bitcoin community is divided. First of all, it’s important to realize that not all ETFs are the same. Out of the 10 ETFs currently being reviewed by the SEC, only one will actually hold physical bitcoins in its reserves. That one is the much-talked about VanEck bitcoin ETF that was filed through the CBOE exchange earlier this year. The other nine ETF proposals on the SECs table are not backed by bitcoin, but instead backed by futures contracts of bitcoin. In the US, bitcoin futures contracts are traded at two major futures exchanges in Chicago known as CBOE and CME.  What Is a Bitcoin Futures Contract? Futures contracts were originally designed for farmers and other commodity producers to lock in prices of the commodities they wished to trade at a future date. When that date came, the holder and the issuer of the contract would settle it by having the commodity physically delivered to the person holding the contract. Bitcoin futures, however, are structured in a way that has no link to the actual market for bitcoin. Instead of having bitcoins delivered to the person holding the contract when it expires, the contract is settled in cash, without any bitcoins ever changing hands. Despite this, some experts have claimed that bitcoin futures have caused greater volatility in the bitcoin market, in particular on the days the contracts expire. Do Futures-Based ETFs Matter? Although a futures-based ETF wouldn’t hold any bitcoins, it can still be argued that it is good for the bitcoin market because it spreads knowledge about bitcoin to new types of investors who may choose to buy physical bitcoins at some point in the future. It would also legitimize the asset even more in the eyes of traditional Wall Street investors and financial institutions, and most likely lead to the creation of more bitcoin-based investment products in the future. That said, most experts agree that an ETF backed by physical bitcoins would by far be the most impactful event for the price of bitcoin both in the short and long run. Community Is Divided Some members of the bitcoin community, including technologist and serial entrepreneur Andreas Antonopoulos, are against Wall Street money pouring into bitcoin in the form of an ETF. “I think it's a terrible idea. <...> ETFs fundamentally violate the underlying principle of peer-to-peer money, where each user is operating not through custodian, but has a direct control of their money, because they have direct control of their keys. Your keys - your bitcoin, not your keys - not your bitcoin,” Antonopoulous warned adding that Bitcoin ETF will become an instrument to manipulate bitcoin prices, scaling and forking debates.  Nick Szabo, a famous computer scientist, legal scholar and cryptographer, also shares the same viewpoint, arguing that it “might cause more problems than it’s worth.” I for one am not lobbying for an ETF or for Wall Street-managed money in general. It might cause more problems than it's worth. The recent sell-off by dumb money has or soon will deprecate many opinionated know-nothings in this space. We don't need new ones to take their place. https://t.co/s7OxZt9IrJ Others, however, argue that a regulated investment product such as an ETF is the only way for bitcoin to truly catch on as a mainstream asset class globally, saying that “people do not want self-custody.” Because most people do Not want to self custody. The only people in crypto now are power users, developers and traders. If you wan this to be a global thing, then they will want something that is easy and regulated. That’s facts. The next deadline for the SEC to decide on a bitcoin ETF is Thursday August 23, when it is set to decide the fate of a proposal from ProShares, a well-established provider of ETFs in the US. ProShares’ proposal includes two ETFs, one that would let investors bet on the bitcoin price going up, and another that would offer short exposure, meaning investors can profit when the bitcoin price goes down. Physical Futures Coming With the link between the bitcoin futures market and the physical market being weak at best, a new start-up dubbed Bakkt is trying to change this by introducing 1-day physically delivered bitcoin futures contracts in November this year. With our solution the buying and selling of bitcoin is fully collateralized or pre-funded. Our new daily bitcoin contract will not be traded on margin, use leverage or serve to create a paper claim on a real asset. The new company, set up by heavyweight financial institution Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) has already received investments from crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital, and is working with major brands like Microsoft, BCG, and Starbucks on developing the platform, which Wall Street veteran Mike Novogratz referred to as “the most important news in crypto this year.”"
0," It’s an understatement to say the current price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency pales when compared to its past glories – at $6,700, bitcoin is down roughly 60 percent from its all-time high. That said, market conditions aren’t the same as they have been in years past. Indeed, bitcoin’s 2017 boom has brought new attention, and with it, traders and investors who are left wondering if the asset can ever return to its former glory.  Certainly, there’s no shortage of ways to approach the question, but one effective method is to look at the charts for historical patterns that could speak to investor psychology, and perhaps, yield valuable hints and clues about future performance.  Applying these theories, a market might be expected to “bottom,” or reach a new low, after a speculative bubble bursts in a moment often referred to as “capitulation.” Consisting of extreme selling over a short time period, the infamous 2014 bitcoin bear market finally bottomed out after it lost more than 40 percent of its value in less than three days at the top of 2015. Since such an event could be measured and understood in real-time, some eagle-eyed investors picked up on the move, even drawing attention to it on social media. That’s because, to chart addicts known as technical analysts, all known information about a particular asset is reflected in its price action. So, in order to predict bitcoin’s future, taking a look at its price history is perhaps the best place to start.  It’s an inexact science, and there’s no guarantee history will ever repeat. That said, observing the bitcoin’s past price action yields three possibilities worth of being discussed and considered. While technical analysts only take price action into account, it’s impossible to ignore the implications a bitcoin ETF could have on prices of the cryptocurrency.  As an indication of the effect an ETF can have on prices of an asset, gold prices increased drastically in the years following the introduction of an ETF. Using this as a measure, it’s valid to assume bitcoin would succumb to a similar and explosive fate.  With several ETF proposals awaiting a decision, most importantly the VanEck-SolidX ETF on September 30, a trader must account for any possible outcome. The market is already overwhelmingly bearish, so the true devil’s advocate would play contrarian and account for the ETF’s trend-changing approval.  As shown in the above chart, ascending trend lines of support have played an important role throughout the history of bitcoin prices.  The first trendline took effect in 2012 when it provided reliable support for a strong uptrend from $2-$16. After surpassing $16, price action went completely parabolic, straying away from trendline until making a return at the end of 2014.  This time however, price broke through the support and immediate capitulation took place, selling off more than 40 percent of bitcoin’s price in three days.  Since the infamous capitulation and 2015 market bottom, price found a new ascending support (lower white line) that will look to once again come into play sooner than later.  The devil’s advocate claims “we’ve seen the worst” of the 2018 bear market, so he is expecting a bounce on or before the fast approaching trendline. The argument has merit, as several bitcoin ETF proposals will be decided upon in the next few weeks and an approval could be just enough to salvage the trend, avoiding large-scale capitulation entirely.  If there’s no bitcoin ETF approval, one could argue there’s no reason for bitcoin to resume its bullish uptrend until a market bottom occurs like it did in 2014-2015.  Here lies the second bear market ending scenario.  Looking at how dramatically price reacted to a breach of its first long-term ascending support in the chart, it’s reasonable to assume it would have a similar reaction if the current trendline breaks (middle white line). If this does occur, there are two locations that present optimal bottoms following substantial capitulation. The first “bottom zone” lies in the $5,000 area since it was the peak resistance level of the prior bull move, from $3,000 to $5,000.  Support and resistance lines experience an effect known as “polarity” when they are surpassed. When this occurs, resistance converts into support and vice versa because the party holding up or down prices has finally given up, which shifts control to the opposing party.  It’s important to note the $5,000 area has yet to be truly tested as support since it was initially breached as resistance. This suggests a test of the level as support is likely and elects it as a potential candidate for the market bottom. However, capitulation from current levels would not be overly severe for the $5,000 level to hold, perhaps leaving some to believe the market needs more extreme sell-offs in order to find a true bottom. That is where the next potential “bottom zone” of ~$3,000 could come into play.  Technically speaking, the $3,000 level is much stronger support than $5,000. Similar to the above zone, $3,000 marked the peak resistance of a prior bull move, except after this resistance broke, the same level was sufficiently tested and proved as support. What’s more, the $3,000 bottom zone would represent an 85 percent deprecation from bitcoin’s all-time high, a near identical peak-to-bottom percent difference as the 2014 bear market of 86.65 percent, according to figures from the Bitstamp exchange.  Perhaps here lies another devil’s advocate, the ultra-bearish contrarian.  Upon a close examination of the price level (~$240) where the first ascending support trend line was breached in Jan. 2015, it coincidentally also marks the exact peak of the prior “mega” bull run when price surged nearly 1,000 percent from $16 to $240.  In a sense, breaking both the trend line and prior bull run high was a “double whammy” to investors giving them no other choice than to lose complete hope, the necessary precursor to capitulation.  According to this theory, if the current ascending trend line breaks, price may not find its “bottom” until reaching the high of the prior “mega” bull run, which in this case lies in the $1,200 area.  If prices were to fall to this level, it’s last hope would be to eventually find a new ascending support for the entire “bull cycle” to repeat, an estimated outcome depicted by the dashed white line in the chart.

1," Bitcoin buyers failed once again to surpass the USD 6,500 and USD 6,600 resistance levels. BTC/USD declined and broke the USD 6,400 support to test the next support at USD 6,250 where buyers appeared. More importantly, there was a solid rise in selling pressure on ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash. ETH/USD broke the USD 295 and USD 285 support levels to move into a bearish zone. The current price action indicates that bitcoin and altcoins failed to gain momentum above key resistances (as discussed in yesterday’s market outlook), resulting in a bearish reaction. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price came under renewed selling pressure and declined below the USD 6,400 support. BTC/USD tested a crucial support near the USD 6,250 level, which acted as a solid buy zone. The price is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) correcting higher, but the broken supports at USD 6,400 and USD 6,500 are likely to act as resistances.
If buyers fail to push the price above the USD 6,500 resistance, it could decline once again. On the downside, the USD 6,250 support holds a lot of importance, below which, the price may perhaps test the USD 6,000 level. Ethereum
Ethereum declined sharply after sellers managed to push the price below the USD 300 support. ETH/USD dropped below the USD 290 and USD 285 support levels to move into a bearish zone.
The price tested the USD 270 level and it is currently rebounding. However, the previous supports at USD 285 and USD 290 are likely to act as major barriers for buyers. Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash price managed to stay above the USD 520 support. However, BCH/USD seems to be facing many hurdles on the upside near the USD 560 and USD 580 levels. On the flip side, a break below the USD 520 support could ignite bearish moves towards USD 500 and USD 480.
Ripple price tested the USD 0.320 support area and is currently recovering towards USD 0.340. Above this, XRP/USD may possibly test the USD 0.350 resistance in the near term. Other Altcoins Market Today
The market sentiment turned short-term bearish, pressuring many small cap altcoins like tezos, VERI, AOA, KCS, BTCP, kin, populous, XZC, funfair, cortex, RDD and RHOC (all declined between 8%-16%). Overall, bitcoin has to move above the USD 6,400 and USD 6,500 resistance levels to overcome selling pressure. If not, there is a risk of a downside break below USD 6,250 and USD 6,000 in the near term. _____

1," The number of short orders placed on bitcoin is less than 3 percent – or 1,196 orders – away from setting a new all-time high, according to data from cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. As of 16:00 UTC Tuesday, there are 39,524 short orders outstanding, marking its highest level in more than four months. Shorts have only been higher on one occasion: April 12, when the figure reached 40,719 orders.  Bitcoin shorts of this amount speaks volumes about the prevailing market sentiment being overwhelmingly bearish, given that investors continue to bet that the price of the cryptocurrency will sink further in the near term.  There is cause to caution the bears, however. Since more than 16,000 shorts were opened at a bitcoin price below $6,700 (Aug. 8th through today), a less than 4.5 percent increase in bitcoin’s current price of roughly $6,435 could cause a significant portion of the total shorts to cover, or have to buy BTC back in order to close their losing position. Such an occurrence can cause prices to quickly rise even further due to the increase in buy orders, an effect known as a “short squeeze.” A short squeeze of this nature is not without merit as a near-identical situation came to fruition on April 12, the same day shorts reached an all-time high. On that day, bitcoin opened at a price of $6,943 but ultimately reached a 24-hour high of $8,087 as a result of a significant amount of short orders needing to be closed.  As seen in the above chart, circumstances between April 12 and today are very similar. On both occasions, price traveled sideways in the mid-$6,000 range following a steep downswing in prices. This allowed for the emboldened bears to put up an abundance of short orders on Bitfinex, depicted by the red line indicator. What’s more, the relative strength index (RSI), an indicator used to identify “overbought” or “oversold” market conditions, is printing a near identical daily value (~44) as on April 12th.  Indeed, the stage is set for a massive short squeeze, but there is no guarantee bitcoin prices will rise enough to force those shorting to close their positions.  Until then, both bears and bulls are waiting eagerly and watching as the events unfold.  Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.

1," History often has a way of repeating itself. The current price pattern in the bitcoin market is eerily similar to the one observed in the run-up to a major rally that occurred on April 12. To start with, bitcoin charted a long-tailed candle on Aug. 14, similar to the one seen on Apr. 1, signaling the sell-off from the July 24 high of $8,507 has likely run its course. Further, the leading cryptocurrency has spent the last seven days trading in a sideways manner around $6,400. Back in April, the cryptocurrency traded around $6,800 in the first 11 days before rising sharply above $8,000 on April 12. More importantly, during the bitcoin price consolidation of early April, the BTC/USD shorts on Bitfinex jumped more than 44 percent to print a record high of 40,719 and fell sharply on April 12, meaning the big spike in BTC was likely fueled by the unwinding of short positions. Interestingly, the short positions on Bitfinex currently stand at $38,640 – the highest level April 12 – and are just short of the record high of 40,719, as seen in the chart below.   As seen in the daily chart above, BTC looks to be repeating the price action seen in early April. Even the relative strength index (RSI) is positioned exactly where it was ahead of April 12. So, the question now is will bitcoin repeat the history by producing a $1,000 rally in the next few days? In theory, a sharp rise in short positions during price consolidation is considered a sign the market is preparing for another round of sell-off. However, in BTC’s case, the consolidation is happening after a 30 percent drop, meaning the cryptocurrency is oversold. Add to that the extreme bearish positioning, as indicated by the near record high BTC/USD shorts, and there is always a risk of a short covering rally. So, it seems safe to say history will likely repeat itself. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing. Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; Charts by Trading View"
0," In a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of California, a 21-year-old bitcoin dealer was identified and “ordered held without bail” on charges of him operating an “illegal money transmitting business” in the United States. As part of his bitcoin exchange business, the young man, identified as Jacob Burrel Campos, accepted cash payments in person, through his bank account, and through MoneyGram, while failing to comply with anti-money laundering requirements. According to the document from the US Attorney’s Office, he had a “no questions asked” policy towards his customers, and charged a 5% exchange fee for his services. He is also accused of sending over USD 900,000 from his bank account to “a bank account in Taiwan in the name of Bitfinex,” and then using those funds to buy bitcoins in order to operate his business. For this, the young California man is charged with 28 counts of international money laundering, carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Jacob Burrel Campos was arrested on August 13 this year as he was entering the US from Mexico. Noting that Burrel has “citizenship in three countries, no steady employment in the United States, and the ability to access large sums of cash,” authorities concluded that there was a significant risk of him fleeing and that he should be held without bail. In another case earlier this year, a Texas man admitted that he had used customer deposits on a bitcoin platform he operated for his own personal expenses, and that he had lied to customers about a hack on his platform back in 2013. The former bitcoin exchange operator is now facing up to 20 years in prison under US federal laws."
0," Bitcoin (BTC) is stuck in a narrowing price range and the direction of the next breakout is far from certain. The leading cryptocurrency was expected to rise toward $7,000 over the weekend, having moved past a key technical hurdle on Friday. However, contrary to expectations, BTC failed to absorb supply around $6,600 in the last 48 hours.  Even so, the rejection at $6,600 has not proved costly, and BTC’s bears have struggled to bring the cryptocurrency below the psychological support of $6,300. BTC is now being squeezed into a tight $300 trading range and is changing hands at $6,400 on Bitfinex at press time – up 0.80 percent on a 24-hour basis.  As seen in the chart above, BTC has created a narrowing price range, popularly known as a pennant pattern, over the last five days.  As of writing, the pennant resistance (top end) is located at $6,595 and the support (lower end) is seen at $6,320.  A bullish breakout would be confirmed if the 4-hour candle closes above $6,595. That would add credence to the bullish relative strength index divergence (RSI) and a beach of a key falling trendline witnessed earlier this month and would open the doors to a stronger rally towards $7,000 (psychological hurdle).  However, the bears could feel emboldened if the 4-hour candle closes below $6,320. In this case, BTC could drop below $6,000 (February low). It’s worth noting that a downside break of the pennant would push the RSI below the rising channel support and that would only validate the bearish price pattern.   Over on the daily chart, a bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs) indicates the path of least resistance is to the upside.  That said, the overall bias as per the daily chart remains bearish as long as the cryptocurrency is trading below the ascending trendline drawn from the June 29 low and July 12 low. At press time, both the rising trendline and 100-day MA are located at $7,067.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

1," Bitcoin started a slow and steady rise after testing the USD 6,250 support area. BTC/USD is trading with positive signs above USD 6,400 and it seems like the price could accelerate above the USD 6,500 resistance in the near term. Similarly, ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin and neo traded higher with bullish moves. The current market sentiment is signaling more upsides as long as bitcoin price is trading above the USD 6,250 support. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price remained in an uptrend from the USD 6,000 swing low and it recently settled above USD 6,250. BTC/USD is currently up around 1% with the immediate resistance at USD 6,500 (UTC 08:20 AM). Above this, the price is likely to climb towards the USD 6,700 and USD 6,800 resistance levels.
On the other hand, if there is a downside correction, the USD 6,250 support zone could act as a strong barrier for sellers. Below this, the price will most likely retest the USD 6,000 support area. Ethereum
Ethereum is currently up more than 3% and is trading near the USD 300 - USD 305 resistance zone. If ETH/USD settles above the stated resistance zone, it could continue to rise towards the USD 330 level.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 290 followed by USD 284. Below this last, the price may perhaps test the USD 260 support level. Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash is slowly rising towards the USD 540 resistance. If BCH/USD clears the USD 540 resistance, it might accelerate above USD 550 to test the USD 565 resistance. On the downside, there are decent supports near the USD 520 and USD 505 levels.
Ripple price surging above the USD 0.300 resistance and it is currently up more than 7%. The next resistance for XRP/USD buyers is near the USD 0.325 level, above which, the price could test USD 0.340. Other altcoins market today
Many small cap altcoins rallied today by more than 20%, including cortex, VET, NPXS, nano, ONT, WTC, PPT, kin, verge, bitcoin private and AION. Out of these, cortex and VET were the best performers with 54% and 46% gains respectively. Overall, bitcoin is trading with many positive signs above USD 6,250. A successful close above USD 6,500 will most likely trigger more upsides in BTC/USD and altcoins in the coming sessions.

1," Following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's evasion of the Bitcoin ETF question, an alternative is now being offered to US investors. A Bitcoin-based ETN (exchange traded note) listed on Nasdaq Stockholm exchange is being quoted in dollars since Wednesday, under the ticker CXBTF. ETNs are close cousins to ETFs (exchange traded funds), but there are some key differences. ETNs are structured products that are issued as senior debt notes, while ETFs represent a stake in an underlying commodity. ETNs are more like bonds in that they are unsecured. ETFs provide investments into a fund that holds the assets it tracks, like stocks, bonds or gold. The Bitcoin ETN has been trading on the Swedish stock exchange since 2015, but was only offered in euros and kronas, Sweden’s native currency. As it is now quoted in dollars, this is an attempt to market it towards US investors - if investors can convince their brokerage account providers to make the Bitcoin ETN available on their platforms. “Everyone that’s investing in dollars can now get exposure to these products, whereas before, they were only available in euros or Swedish krona. Given the current climate on the regulatory front in the U.S., this is a big win for Bitcoin,” CEO of CoinShares Holdings, Ryan Radloff, told Bloomberg. The product is dubbed Bitcoin Tracker One, and according to Bloomberg, trading it is “similar to buying an American depositary receipt, in that traders will see a foreign-listed asset in US dollars.” Although trades will be done in dollars, everything else will take place in the Swedish market. Although it is speculated that a Bitcoin ETF would most likely send the price of the cryptocurrency upwards, the ETN announcement is not expected to have the same effect.  Also, as reported, the largest ETN trader in Europe, Amsterdam-based Flow Traders NV, is now making the first move into this market as it aims to profit from high-frequency trading of ETNs based on bitcoin and ethereum."
1," Cloud mining operator Genesis Mining is terminating customers who are unable to cover their “service fee” because of low mining profitability.  In an email to their clients, the company writes that the decline in bitcoin prices that started in January have coincided with “heavily rising difficulty” of bitcoin mining in April in May. “As a result,” the company writes, “some user contracts are now mining less than the daily maintenance fee requires to be covered, and thus they entered the 60 days grace period, after which open-ended contracts will get terminated.” Also, the company has offered a USD 105 discount to existing customers after upgrading to its premium service, known as Radiant. Cloud mining is the process of hosting mining hardware for clients in a remote location in exchange for a fixed fee usually denominated in fiat currency. This way, the cloud mining operator takes virtually no risk, while the client is left with the risk of the mining contract becoming unprofitable due to increasing mining difficulty or lower cryptocurrency prices. Although Genesis Mining’s FAQ section does specify that the company reserves the right to terminate a contract should the mining rewards of the contract be insufficient to cover the service fee, many users have voiced their frustration with the company. The company is now requesting existing users to upgrade their contracts in order to continue mining with Genesis, but has received mixed reactions from the community. Some are wondering why the company is now asking for more money to pay for the same hashrate as they had before: Strange you make it sound like I can upgrade my current btc contract, but in fact I’m paying paying twice for the same hashrate!? 🤔 the real deal would be if you gave us the option to convert our contracts without extra costs! #unbelievable Others, however, are questioning the company’s customer service: I am an early BTC customer! I'm so glad you can hear me! 😆SO HEAR THIS: MY TICKET #226915 REGARDING 0.1 BTC YOU ERASED FROM MY BALANCE WITHOUT SENDING TO MY WALLET IS OVER 1 YEAR OLD AND YOU STILL DIDN'T REFUND ME OR OFFERED A NEW CONTRACT IN THAT VALUE! DID YOU HEAR THAT? The company replied that “When you're asking us to upgrade you for free, technically you're asking us to connect you to the new set of miners we built out and unplug your current hardware. This isn't sustainable.” 3/3 With this offer we want our old customers to get a fair price for new capacities, but we also understand if this is not feasible for everyone. We really hope the Bitcoin price will recover, and with it, your open ended BTC contracts. Thank you. As bitcoin hash rate — which measures computing power - is growing, so does mining difficulty. Difficulty chart ______ Hash rate chart “The increased hash rate means people are here for the long-term because they’re happy to just accumulate what they have, potentially even run at a loss,” David Sapper, chief operating officer at cryptocurrency exchange Blockbid Pty Ltd. in Melbourne told Bloomberg. At the same time, “they do sometimes have to clear house and dump.” According to various analysts, the break-even price for miners is in a range of USD 6.400 and USD 8.000 per bitcoin and varies depending on the miner’s efficiency.

1," For bitcoin (BTC), the path of least resistance is to the upside, according to technical charts. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,430 on Bitfinex – up 9 percent from the Aug. 14 low of $5,859. However, BTC has failed three times in the last 72 hours to hold on to gains above $6,500, with the latest attempt to scale the psychological level failing a couple of minutes before press time. This may force investors to question the sustainability of the recent rally. But such concerns may be unfounded, as the bullish bias has only strengthened in the last 24 hours, as seen in the technical charts below. As a result, BTC could rise toward $7,000 (psychological resistance) over the weekend. BTC scaled the channel resistance (top end) earlier today, confirming a bullish breakout, that is, the sell-off from the July 25 high of $8,507 has ended and the bulls have regained control. A closer look at the chart reveals the top end of the channel has been playing a spoilsport since Wednesday. Hence, it seems safe to say the bulls are feeling emboldened, having crossed a key hurdle. The cryptocurrency has also found acceptance above the 50-candle moving average (MA) and looks set to test the 100-candle MA, currently located at $6,725.  The relative strength index has witnessed a bull flag breakout – a bullish continuation pattern – which indicates BTC could soon pick up a strong bid and jump to the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline of $6,715. Acceptance above that level would open the doors to $7,500 (target as per the measured height method).  The 5-day MA is beginning to rise in a bull-friendly manner and has almost crossed the 10-day MA from below (bullish crossover). This change of direction by the 5-day and 10-day MA points to a short-term bullish setup. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

1," Two days after Jim Cramer made bearish comments on Bitcoin, the BTC price has started to revive itself. A bullish reversal is not yet confirmed, as Bitcoin would have to break above key resistance for that to happen.  However, the BTC price has moved back to above $6,000, which indicates a trend reversal could very well be in progress.  And yet, Cramer has still thrown in the Bitcoin towel. He even did so on the day that Bitcoin crossed a high of $6,259. So what gives? It’s difficult to say, as the crypto market is somewhat divided this week. Some are saying it’s game-over for Bitcoin, while others are confident BTC is eyeing a new target for bull reversal. For those believing Bitcoin is coming to an end, we have Jim Cramer.  On Tuesday, Cramer, who is the co-founder of the TheStreet, said to his CNBC audience that Bitcoin nearing 2018 lows suggests that the possibility of recovery is becoming less likely. Here, the 63-year-old former hedge fund manager is likely talking about the February low of $6,000, which, if the BTC price falls during the rest of the week, is possible of being hit.  Jim Cramer didn’t outright state that Bitcoin is broken, which is a notion Tom Lee has denied this month. He even made it clear that he’s “not saying its time has passed,” but simply that there is something suggesting “the sun seems to be setting” on the virtual currency. But is he right?  At press time, Bitcoin is selling for $6,356.38, which puts the coin down 0.70% in the past twenty-four hours.  The gist is this: if Bitcoin can move past $6,675, then it’s safe to say a bullish trend reversal has arrived. Sounds like a faraway goal based on today’s BTC activity, but let us not forget the coin jumped to $6,649 on Wednesday. "
1," The ever going discussion on where bitcoin price might be headed next, has intensified in the past few days. With the market still in bearish territory, many traders have taken on short positions that would enable them to profit as the price continues to decline. Their idea is that since bitcoin has remained fairly stable over the past few days as the altcoins, including major coins like ether, litecoin, and EOS, have sold off heavily, it is bitcoin’s turn to fall next. Bitcoin price chart The relative strength that bitcoin has shown has also led to a spike in bitcoin’s overall dominance in the crypto market, recently reaching above 50% for the first time in 2018. Dominance rate Since the explosion in altcoin market capitalization occurred in mid-2017, bitcoin’s dominance rate has only reached the 50%-level for one brief period between late October and early December 2017. As such, traders may now be expecting to see bitcoin’s dominance fall again. However, many traders also know that when “everyone” in a market believes something is about to happen, history shows that the opposite instead tends to occur. Following that logic, a large number of short sellers in a market could in fact lead to higher prices – often in a very violent way. Bitcoin shorts reach record levels The total amount of BTC/USD short positions on the Bitfinex exchange is now reaching the highest levels in 12 months, while the short-to-long ratio is at its highest level since November 2017 at 1.3, as seen in the chart below: If the market starts to move upwards in the near future, many of these traders will exit their short positions by buying back bitcoins in the open market. As the price moves further up, even more short-sellers will get margin calls or hit their pre-set stop-loss levels, forcing them to cover their shorts, and creating a self-reinforcing mechanism that can cause sharp price increases. This is what traders refer to as a short squeeze. On Wednesday, Ran Neu-Ner, host of CNBC’s Cryptotrader show, also noted that bitcoin short positions are close to a 12-month high. He added that futures contracts traded at the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) are set to expire, which has previously caused extra volatility in the bitcoin market. Open short positions on Bitcoin are at a 12 month high today. There is also a CBOE futures close today. We could see a short squeeze again. pic.twitter.com/Yogyq7oAna Some, however, take the idea that “everyone” is now expecting a short squeeze one step further by questioning their logic in a poetic way: Shorts are up.Longs are down.A short squeeze expected,by everyone in town.What if the notion of a squeeze,is nothing but a tease?Hopium for the masses,before the $BTC floor collapses.Love,Zissou It remains to be seen if we will see a giant short squeeze in bitcoin, but don’t be surprised to see strong spikes in price if the market starts to move higher from the current low levels in the next few days."
1," Bitcoin is showing signs of life, but only a break above key resistance at $6,675 would confirm a bullish reversal, technical charts indicate. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,470 on Bitfinex – up 10 percent from the 6.5-week low of $5,859 hit on Aug. 14. However, the break below the key support of $6,000 (February low) was short-lived and prices moved back above $6,100 by UTC close, signaling bearish exhaustion. More importantly, the follow-through has been positive: BTC crossed Tuesday’s high of $6,259 and jumped to $6,649 yesterday, confirming that sellers have likely run dry and bargain hunters are finding the current price too attractive to pass up. Hence, it seems safe to say that a bullish trend reversal is in progress and would be confirmed if prices take out the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance of $6,675, as seen in the chart below. BTC is creating the right shoulder of a inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern on the hourly chart. A move above $6,675 would confirm the sell-off from the July high of $8,507 has ended and would open the doors to $7,490 (target as per the measured height method). That said, the daily and the 4-hour charts show that BTC could attempt a break above $6,675 in the next 24 hours.  As seen in the chart above, the cryptocurrency has pierced the descending trendline, meaning the sell-off from the high of $8,507 has ended. The relative strength index (RSI) has also adopted a bullish bias (above 50.00).  BTC created a bullish inverted hammer candle yesterday, adding credence to Tuesday’s long-tailed (bear exhaustion) candle and confirming the cryptocurrency has likely bottomed out at $5,859.

1," The New York-based magazineHigh Times, famed for its pro-cannabis approach, now announced that they would not accept bitcoin in their upcoming initial public offering (IPO) that seeks to raise up to USD 50 million.  The company had previously said that they hope the addition of cryptocurrencies will “enable a much broader group of investors worldwide” to participate. The cryptocurrencies that the company meant to accept were bitcoin and ether. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, High Times clarified that the announcement was a mistake and that they would not be accepting bitcoin. The filing does not mention ether at all. The filing states, “This press release was distributed in error as the Company will not be accepting bitcoin as payment for shares. As provided in the Company's subscription agreement related to the offering, the Company will only be accepting check, credit card, ACH or wire transfer as payment for subscription to shares.” High Times, which has been a mouthpiece for the pro-cannabis community since 1974, had previously claimed that “with a magazine and online presence still going strong, many are eager to grab some shares.” The first IPO that accepts cryptocurrencies could help crypto adoption, as the IPO market is measured in billions of dollars. For example, the US IPO market rebounded in 2017 as 133 domestic companies went public raising USD 30.4 billion, 33 more IPOs and 79% greater value than the previous year, according to Mergermarket, M&A intelligence, data and research company. Cryptonews.com has previously reported on the race to put cannabis on the blockchain, and how the two industries indeed have much in common. The blockchain is supposed to be helpful in in confirming the compliance of pot that's grown and distributed throughout the US, Canada, and other nations. It will also be helpful in creating a reliable record of customer purchases and preferences, so that growers will know just what kind of cannabis to cultivate and market."
1," Chris Concannon, president and COO of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), explained that there are still obstacles that must be overcomed before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves the first bitcoin-backed exchange traded fund (ETF). “As we chip away at their issues to make them less concerned, at some point they’ll be comfortable with an ETF,” Concannon told Bloomberg. Speaking about bitcoin futures, Concannon noted that trading in bitcoin futures is still low compared to mature assets such as gold or oil. Insufficient trading volume, in turn, makes the SEC hesitant to approve an ETF, although the introduction of an ETF backed by futures would significantly increase the trading volume in the underlying futures contracts. “It’s a chicken-and-egg problem,” he said. Back in June, the CBOE filed a proposal for an ETF on behalf of financial firm VanEck. This is the only such ETF that aims to be fully backed by physical bitcoins rather than bitcoin futures contracts. Some experts claim that bitcoin custody is the crucial issue for bitcoin ETF. Meanwhile, nine other ETFs backed by bitcoin futures are also pending decisions by the SEC. The fact that the ETF was filed through a veteran financial institution such as the CBOE, and that it will hold real bitcoins in its reserves, has made the entire cryptocurrency community particularly excited about the prospects of this particular ETF. CBOEs boss, however, offered his own perspective on the crypto market by saying: “I’ve learned that there’s been more articles than volume. It’s a little bit shocking to me the attention this market gets versus its size. The entire crypto market is a fifth of Apple.”"
1," The cryptocurrency market is flashing green Wednesday following a major downturn, with the total capitalization rising more than $11 billion on a 24-hour basis. The signs of a turnaround emerge in the wake of a rough patch for the market, during which it hit its lowest point for 2018, as CoinDesk previously reported. At press time, bitcoin, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is trading hands at an average of $6,349 – a considerable improvement from yesterday, when the price hit a low of $5,921.65, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Bitcoin hit a high of $6,612.73 during Wednesday’s session, BPI data shows.    A turnaround for the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH) is perhaps most notable given the severity of its recent market free fall. The price of ETH fell from $407 on August 7th to a low of $257 yesterday – a more than 36 percent week-to-week depreciation, according to CoinDesk’s Ether Price Index (EPI). Ether’s plummet made it next to impossible for many cryptocurrencies to show positive growth in BTC value. Sellers of the cryptocurrency have since taken a breather, allowing for a more than 12 percent relief rally in price to occur (by press-time prices). The EPI is reporting a price of roughly $289 at time of writing. The rest of the market immediately followed suit, bringing the total market capitalization at one point back above the $212 billion mark from a more than eight-month low. As of the time of writing, that figure is hovering around $205 billion.  All of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are currently reporting 24-hour gains above 4 percent with the exception of stellar lumens. What’s more, ETH, XRP, Monero, and EOS are all posting gains of above 8 percent, with ETH leading the pack for price growth in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.

0," Square just announced that with its Square Cash app, all users are now able to buy Bitcoin in all 50 US states. Red, white, and bitcoin. Now you can use Cash App to buy bitcoin in all 50 states. pic.twitter.com/D4fhVRz7WL — Cash App (@CashApp) August 13, 2018 Square was originally founded by Twitter’s CEO, Jack Dorsey. The Cash App initially rolled out its Bitcoin services months ago but had to go state-by-state to get approval. Recently, it was reported that Square also secured the so-called ‘BitLicense’ in New York, making it one of only a few cryptocurrency services that are allowed to operate within the state. Georgia, Hawaii, Wyoming, and New York have the strictest crypto regulations, but it seems the Square cash app finally won their approval. This is huge news for the cryptocurrency market, as buying Bitcoin can be a confusing task for most individuals. Making it easier for people to purchase and use is key to mass adoption of the crypto space. It seems Jack Dorsey knows this and is steps ahead of his competition. Announced by CNBC this morning. Square’s Cash app has surpassed Paypal’s Venmo for the first time. According to data composed by the Sensor Tower and Nomura Instinet, the Cash app had a total of 33.5 million downloads in the month of July, compared to Venmo’s 32.9 million. As a result of this news, Square’s stock rose this morning after the opening bell and its shares are up 726 percent since its IPO back in 2015. “If the Cash App continues to grow rapidly, the business could reach or even exceed $100 million in sales by 2020, even without deeper active user penetration,” Dolev said in a note to clients Tuesday. “With impressive user growth and ongoing decoupling from Bitcoin, we believe Square’s monetization efforts are increasingly bearing fruit.” The easier access to Bitcoin, the better it will be for the cryptocurrency industry. It seems both Square and its Cash App will continue to grow and this means positive movement in the crypto space. >> Crypto Retirement Funds Pose Too Much Risk, Says SEC: Don’t Do It Featured Image: Twitter"
0," With the bear market showing no signs of stopping - other than to offer a little hope and then trample all over it again - more HODLers are reconsidering their stance. The opinions on the merits of such an approach are more varied than ever, with representatives of each making a strong case for their view. In one corner are people who have given up on trying to HODL or are against this strategy in general. “One of the things I have disliked the most about the crypto sector is the idea that people should “hodl” or “hold on for dear life. I have written many times here at AVC that one should take profits when they are available and diversify an investment portfolio. The idea that an investor should hold on no matter what has always seemed ridiculous to me,” Fred Wilson, a New York-based famous venture capitalist, wrote in his blog AVC. He added that he can't say whether this is the ""long-awaited capitulation of the HODL crowd or not"", but ""capitulation would be a good thing for the crypto markets, releasing assets into the market that until now have been locked up by long-term holders.” Meanwhile, the social network Reddit is filled to bursting with posts such as: “The ‘HODL’ meme is a cancer in the cryptocurrency space,” or “You people HODLing-only, are your own worst enemy.” The most common argument is that HODLing doesn’t help the trading volume. “How do you expect to see volume and money coming in, when you don't want to contribute to it? It is literally the same thing as the bystander effect. ‘Oh I won't help, I'm sure someone else will’,” writes user u/PhillyCrypto. User u/niftythrow argues that, “HODL only works in a bull market.” The recently published survey showed that 70% of the respondents believe that hodling is more important than spending. Also, the survey found that with bitcoin, 73% spend it ‘almost never’, ethereum - 82%, and litecoin - 89%. 46% of the respondents are of the opinion that the lack of places o spend crypto contributed to the price decline. Meanwhile, others now argue that capitulating isn’t the way to go either. “If you can't stomach a negative asset, you're not for crypto,” says user u/cyrilbenson47. This is almost the same what Charlie Lee of Litecoin tweeted about a year ago: “If you can’t stomach a 90 percent drop in crypto, don’t adopt early.” Those that dropped out, being unable to stomach the losses, shared their stories as well: they mostly invested more than they could afford to lose - something that is incredibly easy to do - and the stress got the best of them. “You can’t put a price on stress levels and your mental health,” writes u/tksopinion. Through all the posts, the community is still trying to remain optimistic and give a little hope to those who are sick and tired of the bear run. How effective this approach will be remains to be seen. In the meantime, bitcoin and altcoins nosedive:"
0," Down two-thirds from its December all-time high of $20,000, bitcoin (BTC) now risks printing fresh 2018 lows below $5,755. The corrective rally seen over the weekend failed to penetrate the key rising trendline hurdle of $6,480 on Monday, allowing the bears to make a strong comeback. As a result, the leading cryptocurrency fell below $6,000 (February low) and extended the slide to $5,859 earlier today – the lowest level since June 29 – according to Bitfinex data. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,032 – down 6 percent in the last 24 hours. Despite sharp losses, bitcoin is the fourth best-performing cryptocurrency among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap. Other cryptocurrencies are reporting bigger losses. For instance, 92 out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have suffered double-digit losses on a 24-hour basis. Further, the bitcoin dominance rate, a measure of BTC’s market share, jumped to an eight-month high of 53.7 percent today. Hence, it seems safe to say that the cryptocurrency markets have turned risk-averse, that is, investors are venturing out of the high-risk alternative cryptocurrencies and into well-established cryptocurrencies like BTC, and then possibly on to fiat currency. Looking ahead, the downtrend in bitcoin prices could continue as the technical chart analysis is calling a deeper sell-off – although support at $5,650 could hold for now.  The bears are likely to be feeling emboldened following the bull failure at the descending trendline hurdle despite the bullish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) seen in the chart above. More importantly, the bullish RSI divergence has been invalidated (prices dropped below $6,000) within three days of confirmation, which indicates the bearish sentiment is quite strong. What’s more, the major moving averages (50-candle, 100-candle, and 200-candle) continue to trend south in favor of the bears. Thus, BTC could hit fresh yearly lows below $5,755 (June low) this week.  As the above chart shows, BTC could encounter support around $5,650 (trendline drawn from the February low of $6,000 and the June low of $5,755). BTC may, however, defend support at $5,650 in the short-term, as the cryptocurrency is looking oversold, having dropped more than 40 percent over the last three weeks. If the support at $5,650 is breached, though, then the lower end of the falling channel, currently located at $5,340, could come into play.

0," The price of bitcoin fell below $6,000 on Tuesday, a move that brought the world’s largest cryptocurrency within 2 percent of its 2018 low.  At press time, bitcoin is trading hands at $5,922, printing a 5 percent 24-hour depreciation, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, up slightly from a low of $5,785 set June 24.  Bitcoin is not alone in the sinking ship, however, as the broader market continues to suffer.  At press time, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is below $200 billion, its lowest figure yet seen in 2018. What’s more, many of the other big name cryptocurrencies already set their lowest prices of the year this past week.  Ether (ETH), the cryptocurrency that powers the ethereum blockchain is trading hands at $264 – its lowest price since November 2017. Likewise, The XRP price has fallen below $0.30, its lowest price of the year and a more than 90 percent depreciation from it’s all-time high over $3 set in December. Image via Shutterstock"
0," Falling prices have sent the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies back below $200 billion. Data from CoinMarketCap shows the total market cap slid to $189 billion on Tuesday, a move that follows successive days of market declines. The market cap first rose above $200 billion in November 2017, a development spurred at the time by the listing of bitcoin futures products. Leading the downward push is zilliqa, which has seen the value of its ZIL cryptocurrency fall by 35 percent in the past 24 hours.  The decline is accompanied by continued growth in the so-called bitcoin dominance rate, or the percentage of the total market cap that is contributed by the world’s largest cryptocurrency. As CoinDesk reported on August 11, the dominance rate rose above 50 percent for the first time in 2018. At press time, that figure is being reported as 54 percent, it’s highest annual total.

0," An Estonian crypto enthusiast and investor identified as German Neff has launched a new campaign aimed at finally finding out who Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, really is.  With the hashtag #findsatoshi, Neff has now taken to the popular Russian crowdfunding website Boomstarter where he is hoping to raise nearly a quarter of a million US dollars to help in the search of the Bitcoin creator. Although people have been searching for Satoshi’s true identity for years without getting any closer to the truth, Neff insists on finding him: “Satoshi needs to be found […] Was it really an enthusiast who gave the world an independent currency or was it a group of people pursuing scientific or purely selfish purposes? Or perhaps Bitcoin is an invention of a large company or an IT giant that decided to take a new direction? Can Bitcoin be the state invention, created with the purpose to control all transactions? There are many assumptions as to who might be behind this, but neither theory has been confirmed.” Neff claims he has been collecting information about Satoshi over the past three years. Having already raised USD 100,000, Neff’s target of a quarter million dollars could be within reach. Driven by his admirable determination, Mr. Neff plans on spending the money to hire private detectives from places like Japan, New York, London, and Russia in one of the biggest search efforts to date for the bitcoin creator. “We, the crypto-enthusiasts, are obliged to find out the truth in order to exist peacefully in this environment. Without the fear that tomorrow a man will come out from behind the curtains announcing that the circus is over and then will disappear again […] We have the right to know the identity of Satoshi,” Mr. Neff and his group wrote on the crowdfunding website.

0," With the Turkish lira extending its decline on Monday after falling more than 20% against the US dollar last week, more and more Turkish citizens are reportedly looking to bitcoin as a way to protect themselves against the falling currency. The most recent declines for the Turkish lira came as a result of a trade dispute with US President Donald Trump, who on Friday announced via Twitter that he had “authorized a doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum with respect to Turkey.”  As the two governments battle it out over sanctions and trade tariffs, ordinary citizens, however, are forced to look for ways to preserve whatever money they may have saved up.  A Reddit user, supposedly from Turkey wrote that awareness about bitcoin is now spreading quickly in Turkey, and that online discussion forums that used to deal with dollar exchange rates are now increasingly used to spread bitcoin charts and investment ideas. However, the same user added that Turkish people still need to get more educated on the issue, and suggested that social media campaigns aimed at increasing knowledge about bitcoin in the country could be very effective. Volume surges on Turkish exchanges According to data from Coinmarketcap.com, Turkish bitcoin exchange BTCTurk has seen an increase in trading volume of 110% over the past seven days, while local competitor Paribu is up by roughly 125% over the same time period. Peer-to-peer trading data also shows increased interest in bitcoin: Measured in Turkish Lira, bitcoin has gained roughly 65% since it bottomed in late June, with the sharpest increases seen over the past few days, according to price data from Bitfinex. And with the lira continuing to spiral downwards, the trend of more Turkish currency being converted into bitcoin is likely to continue. Meanwhile, the South African rand touched a two-year low amidst widespread worries in the market that the situation in Turkey could spill over to other emerging market currencies. The South African rand has long been under heavy pressure, and various media outlets have for months reported that the uncertain situation in the country has benefitted bitcoin, despite the government’s skepticism. Back in Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan over the weekend optimistically asked citizens of his country to convert US dollars and gold into Turkish lira as soon as possible to help the deteriorating situation for the country’s currency.  “Change the euros, the dollars and the gold that you are keeping beneath your pillows into lira at our banks. This is a domestic and national struggle,” Erdogan said, while referring to the US tariffs as an “economic war.”  However, other than telling citizens that the US have “their dollars” and we have “our god,” Erdogan offered little assurance to people who are wondering why they should choose to hold a currency that has depreciated by roughly 45% against the US dollar since the start of the year. Luckily for many people in Turkey, Turkish banks still accept dealings with bitcoin exchanges, meaning cryptocurrency can be bought for local currency on online exchanges. This differs from the situation in Iran, China, and other countries where cryptocurrency trading can happen through peer-to-peer marketplaces such as Localbitcoins.com due to government restrictions. As reported by Cryptonews.com, while cryptocurrencies may look like a refuge for people in struggling economies, there's still no concrete evidence of just how safe they'll be over the long term."
0," Adoption hasn’t kept up with the price growth of major cryptocurrencies, according to Chris Burniske, author and partner at the crypto-focused venture capital firm Placeholder. In a series of eight tweets on Sunday,  he explained his thoughts on the current bear market in crypto. 1/ Why is #crypto falling so much in 2018? Because in 2017 the market was up > 30x, but adoption (beyond investing & trading) wasn’t concurrently up 30x. Burniske, who became somewhat of a pioneer on the topic of cryptoasset valuation with his 2017 book Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond, further said that the market right now is about “10x above January 2017 prices,” while asking if adoption has also grown 10x since then. “On the bright side,” he wrote, crypto will eventually consolidate and we will enter “a new J-curve era.” 4/ On the bright side, as we eventually consolidate #crypto will be entering a new J-curve era 🙂 https://t.co/L4BLHBnC0U Burniske is not alone stressing the importance of adoption. Recently, Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of the Ethereum platform, said that “there's too much emphasis on BTC/ETH/whatever ETFs, and not enough emphasis on making it easier for people to buy $5 to $100 in cryptocurrency via cards at corner stores. The former is better for pumping price, but the latter is much better for actual adoption.” Adoption is a hot topic in the crypto universe. Recent market research has shown that the vast majority of people have no intention of using their cryptocurrency. Instead, they just want to hodl and wait until the prices go up so that they may buy more fiat later on. Meanwhile, Burniske ended his thread by asking what the best fundamental indicators for crypto prices would be, Twitter users responded with suggestions such as “Net capital inflows, GitHub [activity], and political instability,” while others offered “Google search volume” and cryptocurrency integration with merchants as useful metrics. Lastly, one creative Twitter user proposed “usage data of anti-depressants by crypto hodlers” as the most reliable metric to look at in order to understand crypto price movements. In his work on cryptoasset valuation, Chris Burniske has argued that merely looking at market cap can be misleading when it comes to cryptoassets, and that “network value-to-transactions ratio” is the best metric we have for valuing cryptoassets.

0," Bitcoin (BTC) jumped to seven-month highs against Turkey’s national currency, the lira (TRY), on Monday. The price spike comes after the U.S. imposed sanctions against Turkey on Friday for continuing to hold an American pastor in custody. The resultant economic shock-wave has seen the lira drop to a new lifetime low of 7.20 TRY against the U.S. dollar today, after already having dropped 27 percent last week. On a year-to-date basis, the lira is down more than 80 percent against the greenback. The crash in the lira looks very likely to be increasing bitcoin’s proposition as a safe-haven asset in Turkey, and the price of the cryptocurrency shot up to 47,192 TRY earlier today – the highest level since January 21, according to Bitfinex data. At press time, the figure had dropped slightly to around 44,000 TRY. Since August 8, BTC has appreciated against the lira by 31 percent and is also up by 67 percent from the June 24 low of 26,337 TRY. By comparison, the cryptocurrency’s U.S. dollar-denominated exchange rate is up just 12 percent from its low of $5,755 seen on June 24.  So what’s behind the sudden appeal of bitcoin for Turkish investors? The sharp slide in the lira has already pushed up inflation, which, along with a slump in spending power for TRY holders, has certainly boosted bitcoin’s appeal as a store of value. The increased interest is evident from the fact that Turkish cryptocurrency exchanges Paribu, Btcturk, and Koinim have witnessed a spike in trading volumes since Friday. As of writing, Paribu is reporting a 100 percent rise in trading volumes for the BTC/TRY trading pair. Looking forward, BTC could well rise further against the lira, as Turkey’s President Erdogan continues to oppose interest rate hikes to stabilize the currency and, rather than backing down, has referred to the President Trump’s decision to impose sanctions on Turkish steel and aluminum as an “attack“ on its economy.

0," Against expectations, bitcoin (BTC) defended support at $6,000 over the weekend, opening the doors for a stronger corrective rally above $6,480. Friday’s drop below $6,240 (bear flag breakdown) had created room for a drop to the June low of $5,755. Further, BTC closed below Thursday’s low of $6,183 on Friday, signaling a continuation of the sell-off from the July 25 high of $8,507. However, while the odds were stacked in favor of the bears, a break below $6,000 did not materialize. But it was close: the leading cryptocurrency printed a six-week low of $6,008 on Saturday, before rising to $6,500. At press time, price had moved a little lower to $6,450. Looking ahead, the corrective rally could be extended further towards $6,850 if the bulls can overcome solid-looking resistance at $6,480, as seen in the chart below.  On the 4-hour chart, BTC is currently working hard to scale the trendline hurdle of $6,480. A convincing break above that key resistance level would validate the bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by a bullish relative strength index (RSI) divergence over the weekend, and could be a springboard on to a stronger rally toward $6,850. That could still be a tough task, though, as the downward sloping (bearish) 50-candle moving average (MA) is currently located at $6,580, while the 100-candle MA is soon set to cross the 200-candle MA from above in favor of the bears. As a result, a repeated failure to take out trendline resistance could shift focus back to bearish MAs and weaken the bull case. BTC created an inverse head-and-shoulders-like pattern on the hourly chart over the weekend and cleared the neckline hurdle earlier today, adding credence to the bullish RSI divergence seen in the 4-hour chart. The bullish breakout has opened up upside toward $6,850 (target as per the measured height method). Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

1," It takes two to tango in the world of crypto trading, where a dynamic relationship between buyers and sellers is always on display in something called an order book. A tool that visualizes a real-time list of outstanding orders for a particular asset, order books represent the interests of buyers and sellers, offering a window into supply and demand. But while all order books serve the same purpose, their appearance can differ slightly among exchanges. That said, they are all built with the same features and functions. Examples from Coinbase Pro, Binance, Bitfinex and Kraken are shown below:  To become comfortable reading order books, it is essential to understand four main concepts: bid, ask, amount and price. This information is displayed on two sides of the order book known as the buy-side and sell-side. For the purposes of this explanation, we will be using the BTC/USD order book from one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Bitfinex. Although the two sides display opposing information, the concepts of amount (also referred to as size) and price are relevant to both. Simply put, the amount and price per order display the total units of the cryptocurrency looking to be traded and at what price each unit is valued. In the example below there is an open buy order in the amount of 20.24 at a price of $8218.50.  This means the entity who opened this order would like to purchase 20.24 units of bitcoin at a price of $8,218.50 per unit. In the Bitfinex order book, you will also see the terms “count” and “total.” The count refers to how many orders are combined at this price level to create the amount, whereas the total is simply a running total of the combined amounts. The buy side represents all open buy orders below the last traded price. This offer from the buyer is known as the “bid.” It effectively voices the trader’s interest, stating something like, “I am bidding on X units you own at a specific price in the hopes of purchasing them.” Once the bid is matched with an appropriate sell order, the trade can be facilitated. When there is an abundance of buy orders (demand) at a specific price level, something known as a buy wall is formed. Buy walls have an effect on the price of an asset because if the large order cannot be filled, neither can buy orders at a lower bid. The price will not be able to sink any further since the orders below the wall cannot be executed until the large order is fulfilled – in turn helping the wall act as a short-term support level.  In the example above, we can see a large order of 500.2 BTC units waiting to be filled with a bid of $6,263. Since the order is rather large (high demand) compared to what is being offered (low supply), the orders at a lower bid cannot be filled until this order is satisfied – creating a buy wall. In this case, the buy wall is helping the $6,263 price level of bitcoin act as short-term support. Conversely, the sell side contains all open sell orders above the last traded price. This price is known as the “ask.” It states, “I am asking someone to buy X units I own at a certain price.” The opposite of a buy wall is formed when there is an abundance of sell orders (supply) at a specific price level, known as a sell wall. If there is a very large sell order unlikely to be filled due to lack of demand at the specified price level, then sell orders at a higher price cannot be executed – therefore making the price level of the wall a short-term resistance. All in all, the order book gives a trader an opportunity to make more informed decisions based on the buy and sell interest of a particular cryptocurrency. Essentially, it provides a “behind the scenes” view into live-action supply and demand which may reveal order imbalances, market manipulation and support/resistance zones – all of which can be used to a savvy trader’s advantage.

1," Bitcoin (BTC) now makes up 50 percent of the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization. Shortly past 03:00 UTC on August 11, CoinMarketCap’s bitcoin dominance rate – an indicator that tracks the percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization contributed by the leading cryptocurrency – reached 50 percent for the first time since December 19th, 2017. At press time, bitcoin’s market capitalization now records $105,785,552,545, which is about $901 million more than the market capitalization of every other cryptocurrency combined. Chart via CoinMarketCap The above chart shows bitcoin’s dominance rate has been on a steady incline over the past few months, currently representing a 14 percent increase from May 1st. In the same time period the market dominance of all other cryptocurrencies have largely been on the decline. Conditions were much different the last time bitcoin’s market dominance was above 50 percent. On Dec. 19th, the average price of BTC was $17,605.81 across exchanges – an 65 percent higher price than the cryptocurrency’s value today, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.

0," Both Bitcoin bears and bulls will be watching the BTC price over the weekend. While some see a potential corrective rally occurring, others believe the cryptocurrency is at the end of its road. One Wall Street analyst believes the latter. In fact, Jeff deGraaf said it’s “game over” for Bitcoin. But is that true? Yesterday, CNBC reported that Jeff deGraaf of Renaissance Macro Research declared that Bitcoin is “permanently impaired.” He then added that investors should start betting against the cryptocurrency, but only if it breaks through its year-to-date support. There are a lot of people in the crypto community that cause panic when it’s not needed, but deGraaf is not one of those people. Being a respected Wall Street chart technician, the man knows the subject he is speaking on quite well. There’s no denying that the Bitcoin market has taken a hit over the past three weeks. After hitting a high of $8,450 in July, Bitcoin has dropped back down to the $6,000 level. But despite analysts like Jeff deGraaf thinking it’s game-over for Bitcoin, there are people like Tom Lee who remain confident that Bitcoin is not broken. In fact, the Bitcoin Misery Index appears to indicate so. The crypto market is one big game of speculation. People are always going to have different opinions on the direction of the market. Therefore, the best thing to do is to keep an eye on crypto prices yourself. Here’s what the numbers are telling us on Friday, August 10th. At press time, Bitcoin is selling for $6,474.43, which puts the coin down 0.26% in the past twenty-four hours. Today’s close is going to be very important. If Bitcoin can close above $6,628, then it’s likely that Tom Lee is correct when he said Bitcoin isn’t broken. However, if the BTC price closes below $6,183 today, then the words spoken by deGraaf yesterday are likely true. What do you think about what deGraaf said? Is it really game-over for Bitcoin? Moreover, where do you think the BTC price will close today? >> Golden Gate Ventures to Launch $10 Million Blockchain and Crypto Fund Featured Image: Depositphotos/© EdZbarzhyvetsky"
0," Tuesday’s delay of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision regarding the VanEck bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF) is not the central issue that the market should focus on, although it was a frustrating event for investors, Matthew Newton, market analyst at social trading platform eToro, stressed. In an emailed statement to Cryptonews.com, Newton said that “the lingering question mark for the SEC is around bitcoin custody,” adding that “to approve the decision, they’d need to do so in the knowledge that the ETF was backed by physical bitcoin – either stored by the CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange) or a third party.” He further said that the financial institutions now moving into the crypto space will have to decide whether they want to develop their own storage and custody solutions, or if they instead want to work with players in the crypto space that are already offering such services. “We could even start to see consolidation in the market with heavyweight finance houses acquiring crypto companies. Goldman Sachs has already begun deliberations over custody, so watch this space,” the market analyst said, referring to a recent report from Bloomberg that the veteran investment bank is looking into offering custody services for its clients. Also, according to Google Trends, public interest in the issue of bitcoin custody is growing again: Meanwhile, search interest for the term “bitcoin etf” reached its peak for the year in the last week of July: In either case, the search term “bitcoin etf” is much more popular than “bitcoin custody”: Ten Bitcoin ETFs Pending SEC Decision In addition to the filing by VanEck, made through CBOE, nine other bitcoin-based ETF applications are currently being reviewed by the SEC.  The SEC is required to make an initial decision on the applications within 45 days after they have been published in the US Federal Register. Given current rules, however, the regulator can push back its decisions several times, which means that we may not have a decision on VanEck’s ETF proposal until February next year. The next deadline for the SEC to decide on a bitcoin ETF is August 23, when it is set to decide the fate of a proposal from ProShares, a well-established provider of ETFs in the US. ProShares’ proposal includes two ETFs, one that would let investors bet on the bitcoin price going up, and another that would offer short exposure, meaning investors can profit when the bitcoin price goes down. However, rather than holding actual bitcoins, the ProShares ETF would be holding bitcoin futures contracts. Judging from the comments of eToro’s Matthew Newton and others, the other nine filings may have slim chances of getting an approval, given the fact that the VanEck ETF is the only one backed by physical bitcoins held in custody.  In Newton’s own words, “along with regulatory oversight, this question of custody will determine the next big move in the market.”"
0," Bitcoin’s (BTC) close today will likely decide the short-term trend in prices. The leading cryptocurrency snapped a three-day losing streak on Thursday as the 26 percent sell-off witnessed in the last three weeks was looking overstretched. What’s more important is that BTC traded yesterday within the high and low range of the previous day, indicating the bears have likely run out of steam and the bulls are still reluctant to enter the market at these levels. It seems safe to say that the bitcoin market has become indecisive in the last 24 hours. However, a stronger corrective rally could be seen over the weekend if prices find acceptance above the previous day’s high of $6,628, though it won’t be an easy task. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $6,350 on Bitfinex – down 4 percent from the highs seen yesterday. As seen in the above chart, BTC created an inside-day candle yesterday, signaling indecision among both bulls and the bears. A close (as per UTC) above $6,628 (previous day’s high) would confirm a short-term bear-to-bull trend change. On the other hand, if prices close today below $6,183 (Thursday’s low), then BTC could resume the sell-off toward the June low of $5,755. As of now, this scenario appears more likely as the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MA) are steeply sloping south, indicating strong bearish pressure.  As the above chart shows, BTC has created a bear flag – a bearish continuation pattern – which indicates the sell-off from the high of $7,130 (pole high) would resume if prices take out the flag support (lower end) of $6,240. A bear flag breakdown, if confirmed, would open the doors to $5,240 (target as per the measured height method), although the target looks far-fetched as of now. That said, it could easily yield a drop to the June low of $5,755. The relative strength index (RSI) has breached the rising trendline in favor of the bears. Hence, the probability of BTC witnessing a bear flag breakdown in the next few hours is high. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

1," Cryptocurrencies may generate higher risk-adjusted returns than stocks and other assets traditionally thought of as “safer,” according to a new study from Yale University.   The study, named “Risks and Returns of Cryptocurrencies” was carried out on three major cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin, Ripple and Ethereum – by calculating the Sharpe ratio, a measure for the performance of an asset adjusted for risk and volatility. The ratio provides a mathematical method to compare how different assets compensate the investor for the risk taken, making different assets more comparable. The price data examined for Bitcoin was the most comprehensive, spanning from 2011 to 2018. For Ripple and Ethereum, the price data began in 2012 and 2015, respectively. At the monthly frequency, the Sharpe ratios of bitcoin are similar to those of stocks for the comparable time period, although higher than the historical Sharpe ratios for stocks, the study found. Meanwhile, at the daily and weekly frequencies, the ratios are about 50% and 75% higher than those of stocks for the comparable time period.  The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better an asset is compensating an investor for the associated risk. The comparison of the Sharpe ratios
Stock* shows results for the whole sample between 1953/07 and 2018/04. Below are the Sharpe ratios for Ethereum and Ripple, as presented in the study: _______ _______ The two scholars behind the study, economist Aleh Tsyvinski and Ph.D. candidate Yukun Liu, further found that cryptocurrencies do not behave in a fashion similar to stocks, fiat currencies, or precious metals, and that it is therefore necessary to use other methods than those traditionally used to predict performance. Two trading strategies Two phenomena the researchers found to be useful in terms of predicting the performance of cryptocurrencies include the “momentum effect” and an effect they referred to as “investor attention.” Investor attention could essentially be thought of as the level of hype among people. For example, an abnormally high number of Google searches or tweets about positive things related to cryptocurrencies such as “buy bitcoin,” tends to generate higher returns in bitcoin. Likewise, high numbers of searches on things like “bitcoin hack” tends to lower returns for holders of that asset. Tsyvinski told CNBC in an interview that ""for weekly returns, the Google search proxy statistically significantly predicts 1-week and 2-week ahead returns."" The momentum effect is another phenomenon well-known in finance, which basically says that an asset that has gone up in price, tends to continue up, simply as a result of more and more investors jumping on the bandwagon.  To take advantage of the momentum effect in bitcoin, the two researchers developed a simple trading strategy that says a trader should buy bitcoin if its price increases more than 20% in the previous week, and sell seven days later. “This strategy generates outstanding returns and a very high Sharpe ratio,” the two were quoted by Yale University’s news portal as saying. Lastly, the pair claims to have debunked the myth that the cost of mining can predict cryptocurrency prices, as experts such as Tom Lee argues for. “We were surprised to see that it does not predict cryptocurrency returns,” the scholars said."
1," Canaan Creative, the world’s second largest maker of bitcoin mining machines, is bringing a new model to market that appears to beat the current competition from Bitmain’s Antminer S9. Canaan’s AvalonMiner A9 is reportedly capable of hashing rates of up to 30 TH/s, or more than double that of the current top model from Bitmain. In cryptocurrency mining, hash rate is the speed at which a mining machine can operate. A higher hash rate would allow a machine to get more mining rewards over a given period of time. The new bitcoin miner was announced at a Canaan press conference on Wednesday and later confirmed on the company’s Chinese WeChat account.  However, Steven Mosher, global head of sales and marketing at Canaan, revealed the details of the new miner in a Facebook post earlier, and added that the new miner will start shipping in the 4th quarter of this year: Mosher did not immediately respond to a request for more details. Some attendees at the press conference also took to Twitter to share pictures from the event held in Hangzhou, China: #avalon press conference of 7nm #bitcoin miner, price remain undisclosed. pic.twitter.com/gI3KsYRj6t According to cryptocompare.com, a machine with the same specifications as Canaan’s AvalonMiner A9 would be capable of mining BTC 0.4628 per year, or USD 2,939 at current exchange rates. With the new machine, Canaan will take the lead from fellow Chinese rival Bitmain, which is set to hold an initial public offering (IPO) on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in September. Earlier, it has been reported that Canaan has also applied for an IPO in Hong Kong this year. It is speculated that the amount raised through these IPOs will be a good indicator in the general interest in the future of mining and thus cryptocurrency in general.  Just last week, Canaan announced that they are bringing a TV set that doubles as a bitcoin miner to market. However, with a hashing power of 2.8 TH/s, the new TV is still a far cry from the company’s new flagship bitcoin miner. According to cryptocompare.com, a TV set with those specifications can mine BTC 0.04319 per year (USD 273)."
1," Malware tailored for bitcoin ATMs have been made available for sale on “the dark web” – the term used to describe underground websites selling various illegal goods and services, IT security firm Trend Micro claims. While regular ATMs have long been a target for criminals, fraud related to bitcoin ATMs have so far not become much of a thing. Now, according to the firm, it turns out that for about USD 25,000, criminals can purchase bitcoin ATM malware through online forums. The software reportedly allows a fraudster to receive bitcoins worth up to USD 6,750 each time it is used, by “exploiting a service vulnerability in the bitcoin ATM.” According to the seller, the malware ships with a card with a built-in chip and near field communication functionality (NFC) “ready-to-use,” and “does not require any physical access.” The same seller, which appears to be a well-respected member of an underground online forum, also offers various forms of malware for traditional bank ATMs, as well as forged documents on everything from taxes to credit reports.  The particular seller has reportedly received over 100 reviews from customers online, indicating that the expensive piece of malware has generated a substantial income for him, and that it is already being used in several locations around the world.  In conclusion, Trend Micro wrote that “as long as there is money to be made — and there is quite a bit of money in cryptocurrencies — cybercriminals will continue to devise tools and to expand to lucrative new markets.” At the press time, there were 3,522 Bitcoin ATM's around the world, according to coinatmradar.com data. 74% of them are in North America. Number of Bitcoin ATM Installed Over Time In the past, ransomware attacks involving payments in cryptocurrency have been a major problem worldwide. As Cryptonews.com reported on Tuesday, ransomware payments reached at least BTC 22,967 from 2013 to mid-2017, per a research report from TITANIUM, an international project focused on crime and terrorism involving virtual currencies and underground market transactions."
0," The latest Bitcoin news is that Bitcoin (BTC) has taken a major hit this week and has dragged the rest of the cryptocurrency market down with it. At press time, the total cryptocurrency market is sitting at just above $225 billion, which is $75 billion lower than what it was just two weeks ago. Within the last 24 hours, the crypto market has dropped almost $20 billion. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $6,509.67, down -8.50% in 24 hours. For the week, BTC price is down -14.47%, and for the month, Bitcoin price is down -5.15%. This month, Bitcoin had a brief rally that left many crypto enthusiasts hopeful for a brighter tomorrow, but it seems the coin has corrected again. A lot of you seem to think that the ETF approval is not necessary in order for the market to flourish once again. Think again! ETF approval is an absolute necessity to continued $BTC success. Total MC is as high as it’s going to get w/out. SEC ETF approval is the next catalyst. — WolfofCrypto (@bullishgentlemn) August 7, 2018 The Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC) has postponed its decision on approving Bitcoin’s ETF once again, a decision which is entirely being blamed for the market’s downfall. The CBOE, VanEck, and SolidX have all put in a request to offer Bitcoin ETFs and the SEC isn’t ready to make a decision on this just yet. If approved, many believe this could propel the cryptocurrency market to another level—very similar to what the Bitcoin futures were anticipated to do. Bitcoin ETFs would, in fact, help to bring in more institutional investors, where the real money is. Adoption is key to the longevity of cryptocurrency, and the SEC knows that the decision shouldn’t be made swiftly. It remains still unknown when Jay Clayton and the committee will come up with a decision, but we can expect the market to fall until they do. >> Opera Launching a Built-In Crypto Wallet for Its Desktop Web Browser Featured Image: mdkhalil1"
0," The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision regarding a highly anticipated application for a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF) filed by investment firm VanEck through the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). The SEC wrote in its statement that they have so far received more than 1,300 comments from the public on the proposed rule change that would be necessary in order to list the ETF on an exchange. Tuesday’s notice from the SEC would give the regulator until September 30 to decide on whether it will approve or disapprove the proposed rule change. Although many market commentators and investors had already expressed that they expected the decision to be pushed back several times, the market reacted by sending the bitcoin price further down. Bitcoin overnight broke through a technical support found at the USD 6,700 level and is currently (UTC 4:40 AM)  trading at around USD 6,500. Some people, including economist and early bitcoin investor Tuur Demeester, urges caution and warns the market that a bitcoin ETF may not be approved in the US until next year.  Also, as reported, Jake Chervinsky, a US-based lawyer at Kobre & Kim, a law firm, suggested that due to rulemaking procedures the SEC can, and probably, will delay its decision on the VanEck bitcoin ETF until February 21, 2019. Meanwhile, Demeester wrote in an opinion piece that “any anticipation of approval by September will likely be met with disappointment,” while still pointing out that an “ETF approval, even if it's delayed, would be a huge deal because it makes the asset extremely accessible for the retail investor.” Also, the popular crypto youtuber The Crypto Lark shares his view on Bitcoin ETF: #bitcoin $btc ETF delayed, market crashes, #mytwosatoshis https://t.co/ozKoad10OK"
0," The crypto markets are seeing red in a big way Wednesday as an ongoing rout is wiping away billions of dollars in value. As reported by CoinDesk, the collective market capitalization for all crypto assets hit a new low for the year earlier today – as it stands, the overall market cap is roughly $225 billion, representing a significant decline from the more than $800 billion witnessed in early January of this year. Among the developments driving the market turmoil: the fact that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided to punt a decision on a proposed bitcoin exchange-traded fund. As always, the devil is in the details – and these four statistics show a market in turmoil According to figures compiled by CoinDesk, as much as $51 billion in market cap was lost during the past seven days. CoinMarketCap figures indicate that as much as $30 billion or more in value was shed amid the day’s market action. This amount indicates a more than 18 percent decline within that time frame.  But the market capitalization data only tells part of the story. Perhaps most tellingly, all of the top 20 cryptocurrencies (indicated on sites like CoinMarketCap as well as OnChainFX), showed significant declines in the past 24 hours, accounting for an average loss of more than 14 percent during that period. Source: OnChainFX.com For bitcoin specifically, the past days haven’t been exactly forgiving either. The cryptocurrency has seen losses for ten out of the last eleven days – a series of events that have not occurred since September 2014. That extended period of price declines is fully on display in the graph below, pulled from Bitfinex, which shows the market sliding downward after climbing above $8,000 last month.  But the 11-day datapoint has another message: the recent bull run has basically evaporated, CoinDesk analysis shows. Today’s low represents a depreciation of 26.28 percent endured over the bearish stint. As a result, over 80 percent of the recent rally from bitcoin’s annual low has evaporated. In sum, bitcoin’s price rallied $2,705 from June 24th to July 24th, over $2,000 of which has since disappeared, according to data from Bitfinex. Image via Shutterstock; Chart via TradingView"
0," The total market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies just fell to its lowest point in 2018. The developments come after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed a decision on a proposed bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The news triggered a market reaction, ultimately sending the total value of all cryptocurrencies down to $227.8 billion on Wednesday – the lowest level since November 2017 – according to data from CoinMarketCap.  The drop to nine-month lows marks a 10.7 percent depreciation on a 24-hour basis. As of press time, the market capitalization had risen back slightly to $228.6 billion. Although the ETF decision is solely in regards to bitcoin, many alternative cryptocurrencies are printing worse losses than the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, signaling worsening risk sentiment in the market.  The rise in the bitcoin dominance rate – an indicator that tracks the percent of the total crypto market capitalization contributed by the leading cryptocurrency – to an eight-month high of 48.6 percent also suggests the investors are venturing out of alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin, and then possibly on to fiat currency.  The falling spread or difference between the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin and BTC’s market capitalization is also signaling reduced demand for high-risk alternative cryptocurrencies.  At press time, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding bitcoin is just over $118 billion – an 8.5 month low – whereas the total market cap of bitcoin is topping $111 billion, a figure last seen less than a month ago and above its annual low of $99,915,112,929, according to CoinMarketCap.  Meanwhile, the BTC dominance rate is hovering around 48.9 percent and could rise to 50 percent if the risk aversion worsens, boosting demand for well-established cryptocurrencies like BTC.

0," Bitcoin’s recent downtrend has deepened in the wake of a decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to delay a ruling on a keenly awaited bitcoin ETF. The leading cryptocurrency was expected to stage a minor corrective rally in the last 24 hours, having defended the key 50-day moving average (MA) support earlier this week. However, the sellers made a strong comeback above $7,100 after the SEC exercised its right to postpone the decision on whether to approve a rule that would allow Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) to offer shares of a bitcoin ETF issued by VanExk SolidX Bitcoin Trust. As a result, BTC closed (as per UTC) yesterday on a negative note at $6,719 and fell to $6,360 today – the lowest level since July 16. At press time, BTC is trading at $6,500 on Bitfinex. The 7.9 percent sell-off witnessed in the last 24 hours reinforces the view that a major part of the rally seen in July was likely fueled by speculation that a Bitcoin ETF could be approved by the US SEC within weeks. Further, the bear grip around bitcoin has strengthened in the last 24 hours as bitcoin’s drop to three-week lows below $6,400 means the cryptocurrency has retraced more than 70 percent of July’s rally to $8,507. Still, as the SEC has merely delayed its decision until September, there is still a chance that the ETF could be approved next month.  BTC’s break below the ascending trendline (drawn from the June 29 low and the July 12 low) has bolstered the already bearish technical setup. For example, the 5-day and 10-day MAs are sloping south in favor of the bears, and BTC is trading well below the long-term MAs (50-day, 100-day, and 200-day) – all suggesting the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, perhaps, the relative strength index (RSI) is holding below 50.00 (in bearish territory), but has yet to hit oversold territory (below 30.00). Hence, there is scope for a further drop towards $6,000, albeit after a minor bout of consolidation as the short-duration technical charts (below) are reporting oversold conditions.  On the 4-hour chart, the RSI has dropped below 30.00, signaling the sell-off is overdone. As a result, BTC could trade sideways within a falling channel over the next day or two.

0," Tom Lee has always remained optimistic about Bitcoin. True, the Tom Lee Bitcoin price target did change from $25 thousand to $20 thousand last month, but the Fundstrat co-founder is still confident. In fact, Lee remains confident because of what the Fundstrat Bitcoin Misery Index is indicating. On Monday, Tom Lee went against the Bitcoin bears, announcing that no, Bitcoin “isn’t broken,” even if it stays at the current price—which, at press time, is $7,120.73. He also said that Bitcoin is not broken if it’s holding at the current volatility levels. But why does Tom Lee think that? Well, it boils down to what the Bitcoin Misery Index is describing. Back in March, Fundstrat launched the Bitcoin Misery Index, which is essentially a way for investors to know if holders of the coin are ‘miserable’ or not. It’s all based on volatility and price. According to Lee, the Bitcoin Misery Index’s current number is 39, which means it is neither in ‘good’ territory nor ‘selling’ territory. If the index falls below 27, it means future returns are good. No one has to panic (like how people do in the crypto space when prices drop). However, if the index moves past 68%, then you know that it is ‘time to sell’ the cryptocurrency. Despite being higher than 27, Lee thinks the index shows that momentum is en route to recovery. In the interview, Lee pointed out that the crypto industry has seen good things come out recently, in terms of Bitcoin. For instance, the SEC has declared Bitcoin not to be a security. Not to mention the ICE announcing last week its intent to create an integrated virtual assets platform. Huge, considering ICE is the operator of dozens of exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange. There are three things I want to ask: first, do you agree with the $20 thousand Tom Lee price target? Two: Do you believe the Fundstrat Bitcoin Misery Index?

0," Between 2013 and mid-2017, ransomware payments reached at least BTC 22,967.54, which at current prices is more than USD 160 million, a recent study of 35 ransomware families claims. However, the study assumes that ransomware authors cashed out immediately after receiving victims’ payments, which left them with “only” USD 12.8 million in their pockets. The study, titled “Ransomware in the Bitcoin Ecosystem”,  has been released by the researchers who are part of TITANIUM, an international project focused on crime and terrorism involving virtual currencies and underground market transactions. The analysis indicates there are ""clear inequalities in the market, which could be considered as a top-heavy market in which only a few players are responsible for most of the ransom payments."" Below are the Top 15 ransomware families by received payments.  The Locky ransomware accounts for more than 50% of the ransomware payments and the first three families account for 86% of the market while the other 32 families share the remaining 12%, the researchers concluded.  Also, the study adds that the incoming transactions of 12 ransomware families range from very low payments up to USD 2,000. Three ransomware families have higher payments on average: DMALockerv3, GlobeImposter and SamSam. In January 2016, DMALockerv3 was known to ask for ransom payments of 15 BTC (which was equivalent to USD 6491.25). The SamSam ransomware was also known to ask ransoms based on the number of machines infected and the ransom could go from 1.7 BTC (at the time USD 4,600) to decrypt a given machine up to 12 BTC (at the time USD 32,800) to decrypt all machines infected. “Famous ransomware campaigns are likely to be a short-term, one-time deal, in which a ransomware author makes money quickly and then stops, possibly due to various forms of security interventions,” the authors said. Longitudinal payment trend per ransomware family: ""With over 500 known ransomware families, it has become one of the dominant cybercrime threats for law enforcement, security professionals and the public,"" the study says. However, it concludes “that the total ransom amounts gathered through ransomware attacks are relatively low compared to the hype surrounding this issue."" The study is co-authored by Masarah Paquet-Clouston, a security researcher from Canada’s GoSecure Research, Benoît Dupont, a professor from the International Centre for Comparative Criminology of the Université de Montréal, and Bernhard Haslhofer, a Senior Scientist at the Digital Insight Lab at the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT). The three-year TITANIUM project, which stands for Tools for the Investigation of Transactions in Underground Markets, was launched in May 2017, and is designed to develop a range of technical solutions to support the institutions tasked with combating crime and terrorism. The international consortium was formed by 14 law enforcement partners from Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, Spain, and the UK, with the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) also on the list. ""Activities in the second year [of the project] are mainly related to a first release of software components which will be evaluated in field labs,"" Michael Mürling, who is responsible for marketing and communications within the Center for Digital Safety and Security of the AIT, one of the project partners, told Cryptonews.com."
0," The number of people getting involved in cryptocurrency mining is skyrocketing in Russia. Per industry organization the Russian Association of Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain, the number of new companies created to mine Bitcoin and altcoins in the country has risen by 15% since the start of this year, with 75,000 organizations and 350,000 people in the country with population of 144 million now involved in the mining industry. However, profitability has nosedived in the same period. News outlet Segodnya quotes economist and bitcoin investor Tuur Demeester as stating that Russian mining profits may have decreased by a whopping 90% in the first half of 2018, due in no small part to increasing competition in the country. Yet declining profitability appears to be doing little to dampen the enthusiasm many Russians now have for cryptocurrency mining. RusCable reports that an energy provider in Vologda Oblast, in the north of the country, recently discovered a cryptocurrency mine operating in a 47sqm apartment in the city of Cherepovets. The provider, Vologdaenergo, says the apartment was uninhabited, but had been filled with mining hardware, using up some USD 360 worth of electricity a month. Electricity prices in the region are among the lowest in the world: 1 Kilowatt hour of electricity in Vologda Oblast typically costs between USD 0.03 and USD 0.06. As reported, not only in Russia bitcoin miners have seen their profitability plummet as of late, while some miners had to unload their coins to cover some of their losses. Also, with cryptocurrency mining consuming an ever-increasing amount of energy worldwide, some politicians are starting a push for higher electricity rates for miners, arguing that their activities offer “no utility for society.”"
0," The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed a decision on a proposed bitcoin ETF, pushing its final determination ahead by more than a month. In an order published on August 7, officials at the agency wrote that they were giving themselves more time to deliberate on whether to approve what would be the first exchange-traded product of its kind in the U.S. It’s also perhaps unsurprising, given that in the past, SEC officials have used the agency’s statutory powers to push back decisions on bitcoin ETFs. As the agency wrote: “Accordingly, the Commission … designates September 30, 2018, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change.” The proposed rule change from CBOE would, if approved, constitute a critical point on a path to listing a bitcoin ETF, in conjunction with money management firm VanEck and crypto startup SolidX. The companies submitted their proposal back in June, setting off a busy comment period that saw the crypto community rally in support. All told, more than 100 comments were submitted through mid-July. The choice to punt forward a final decision also comes days after SEC commissioners completed a review on a proposed bitcoin ETF from investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, whose multi-year effort was dashed after a majority of the SEC’s commissioners backed up the agency’s original March 2017 rejection. One commissioner, Hester Peirce, dissented from that decision, later telling CoinDesk in an interview that the move to block a bitcoin ETF is a disservice to both investors and innovators. As of press time, the price of bitcoin has not reacted, trading at around $7,060 according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).

0," Bitcoin looks primed for a minor rally, having defended a key moving average support in the last 72 hours. The 50-day moving average (MA), one of the most widely tracked technical indicators, was put to test in the previous two trading days. However, on both occasions, prices failed to penetrate the MA support by the daily close (as per UTC), signaling bearish exhaustion. Today, BTC is following a similar pattern. The leading cryptocurrency picked up a bid around the 50-day MA support of $6,938 earlier today and rose back above $7,000, raising prospects of a corrective rally. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $7,050 on Bitfinex – up 0.70 percent on a 24-hour basis. The solid defense of the 50-day MA support and the early signs of bullish reversal, as seen in the short-duration chart below, indicate scope for a stronger rally toward $7,400.  The above chart shows, the current 4-hour candle is hovering above the top end (resistance) of the falling channel (bearish pattern). A bullish breakout would be confirmed if the candle closes above the falling channel hurdle. In this case, BTC will likely rise toward the downward sloping (bearish) 100-candle MA, currently located at $7,438. This scenario appears likely as a bullish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) signals that the tide has turned in favor of a rally.  BTC created a bearish outside-day candle yesterday, meaning the day began with optimism and ended with pessimism. Still, BTC’s strong showing today backs up indications of bearish exhaustion seen yesterday. While there is a reason to be optimistic, the bulls can’t afford to lower their guard as the 5-day MA and 10-day MAs are still biased toward the bears. If prices close today (as per UTC) below $6,847 (low of the previous day’s bearish outside-day candle), the sell-off from the July high of $8,507 would resume, sending BTC below the rising trendline.

0," As one may find Bitcoin price forecasts for this year ranging from USD 22,000 to USD 60,000, Tuur Demeester, a popular economist and bitcoin-investor, warns that the number one digital currency may be headed for lower prices before the end of the year. However, China may help bitcoin, he adds. Despite many people having called a bottom in bitcoin prices at around the USD 5,700 level seen in June, Demeester argues that on-chain activity on the bitcoin network still does not support its current valuation.  Demeester, who first recommended bitcoin as an investment when it was at USD 5 in 2012, writes in the article that bitcoin miners have faced a decline in profitability of 90% over the course of 7 months. He goes on to explain that miners therefore are forced to sell off a large portion of their mining rewards just to cover their operating expenses. Bitcoin price chart: Next, Demeester predicts that we might have to wait until next year before a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund is approved in the US. Although he acknowledges that there has been a strong uptick in institutional interest for bitcoin this year, Demeester points out that most of that interest comes from trading firms and market makers. In other words, these are institutions that don’t necessarily hold bitcoin as an investment, but rather makes money off of the volatility or by making markets. “Institutions who are known to be long biased, such as mutual funds and pension funds are not ready to invest because they’re not yet comfortable with the available custody solutions,” Demeester argued in his article, shared with more than 170,000 of his followers on Twitter. Despite his no-so-positive outlook on price this year, Demeester also sees several positive developments that could trigger a price rally.  Among these is the possibility that we could see a new wave of Chinese capital flowing into bitcoin as a result of depreciation of the Chinese yuan this year. Due to capital controls in the country, bitcoin is an attractive option used by some people to move capital out of the country."
0," Market manipulation is still flourishing in the crypto world. The Wall Street Journal said it had identified 105 groups on chatting apps Telegram and Discord offering “trading signals,” a type of service that is often associated with pump-and-dumps. In total, the WSJ said that between January and the end of July it identified 175 “pump and dump” schemes involving 121 different digital coins, which show a sudden rise in price and an equally sudden fall minutes later. The report mentions coins such as version, cloakcoin, granitecoin, pesetacoin, stealth, and agrello.  Among the pump-and-dump groups examined by the newspaper, the biggest group – identified as “Big Pump Signal” - had more than 74,000 members in its Telegram channel. Since December, the group has reportedly initiated 26 pumps, totaling around USD 222 million in trading activity. For example, on July 1, after followers of Big Pump Signal were commanded to start buying a token called cloakcoin, the price jumped 50% to USD 5.77 on Binance, a major exchange, before dropping almost a dollar after two minutes, according to the report. In total, 6,700 trades worth USD 1.7 million were executed—compared with virtually no trading the hour before, it added, saying that one user claimed he made USD 1,400 on this pump without going “big”. Cloakcoin price chart: Many of the groups charge monthly fees of USD 50 to USD 250 or require members to evangelize the service for access to trading information, the WSJ said. Pump-and-dump schemes are among the oldest forms of fraud in financial markets and can happen either by traders talking up the price of a particular asset before they cash in on it, or by a group of traders getting together to buy an asset, driving up the price in the process. Once the price has reached the pumpers target, they rush to sell, leaving behind the unknowing traders who bought in. Although pump-and-dumps have long been outlawed in traditional financial markets, they still persist to some degree. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regularly goes after groups that profit from the activity, particularly in the very small so-called micro-cap stocks. In crypto, however, regulators have yet to bring up even a single case against the fraudsters behind these schemes. One problem faced by regulators is that it can be difficult to determine who has jurisdiction over the markets where the fraud takes place. As a largely unregulated market, crypto is traded without regard to national borders and by traders who sometimes stay anonymous, meaning it is an almost impossible task for regulators to take on. Essentially a zero-sum game, a pump-and-dump transfers money from those who jump on the bandwagon when they see the price of an asset gain momentum, to those who initiated the dump. In reality though, it is often only the initiator of the pump signal that is able to sell off the asset with a profit before it’s too late.  As reported, bitcoin price manipulation has already put trust in cryptocurrencies at risk. According to professor Neil Gandal and assistant professor Tyler Moore, exchanges should do more to mitigate this problem, for example by sharing information about the trading behavior of very large traders on their platforms. “The consequence of not taking steps in this direction is likely a loss of faith in cryptocurrencies,” the two scholars wrote in an article."
0," Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is trading in an indecisive manner after hitting 19-day lows below $6,900 on Sunday, but could pick up a bid on acceptance above $7,100, technical studies indicate. The leading cryptocurrency fell to $6,890 on Bitfinex yesterday – its lowest level since July 17 – before ending the day (as per UTC) on a flat note at $7,025. The price action indicates BTC lacks clear bias, but could also be considered a sign of bearish exhaustion, as the prices have already made a 21 percent slide from the recent high of $8,507. If the bulls are able to push prices above Sunday’s high of $7,090, then a minor corrective rally could be in the offing. On the other hand, a slide below the previous day’s low of $6,890 would revive the bearish view. At press time, BTC is trading at $6,975 – down 0.80 percent on a 24-hour basis.  The above chart shows, BTC created a doji candle (marking indecision) on Sunday at the 50-day moving average (MA) support, making today’s close (as per UTC) pivotal. A bull doji reversal would be confirmed if BTC closes today (as per UTC) above $7,090 (Sunday’s doji candle high). In this case, a corrective rally to the 100-day MA, currently located at $7,474, could be seen. Meanwhile, a close (as per UTC) below $6,890 (Sunday’s doji candle low) would signal a continuation of the sell-off from the July high of $8,507. If the bulls fail to force a rally soon, the focus would quickly shift back to the bearish factors: downward sloping 5-day and 10-day MAs, the breach of the key support of 100-day MA last week and a bearish relative strength index (RSI). Further, BTC’s close proximity to the all-important inverse head-and-shoulders neckline support (former resistance) of $6,820 is another big reason why the bulls need to make a quick comeback. A move below $6,820 would invalidate the bearish-to-bullish trend change confirmed by the inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on July 17 and would shift risk in favor of a drop below the rising trendline (yellow dotted line).  As seen on the above chart, the long-term bullish view has been invalidated by BTC’s close at $7,025 yesterday. BTC closed above the falling channel resistance in the previous week, *seeming to confirm* a long-run bearish-to-bullish trend change.  However, the breakout ended up being a bull trap [comma] as the cryptocurrency fell back inside the channel last week, invalidating the long-term bullish outlook Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

0," Tuur Demeester is an economist and investor.  The following article references an opinion and is for information purposes only. It is not intended to be investment advice. Seek a duly licensed professional for that. Despite an already six month cool-off period, for 2018 we see more sideways and downside potential in the bitcoin price due to sluggish retail demand, hesitation from institutions and a current market cap that seems too high relative to the activity occurring on available blockchains. Many investors and advisors are on record stating that $5,700 was the bottom in bitcoin for this year, and that higher prices lie ahead. While we are very bullish on bitcoin’s long-term prospects, we do heed caution for more short-term price optimism. To find the starting point of the historic parabolic rally in bitcoin that ended at $20,000 we have to go as far back as August 2015, when bitcoin traded at below $200. This past rally was a stupendous, historic move. Even in secular bull markets, the collective of economic actors need time to absorb the information embedded in its characteristic high volume rallies. As I’ve indicated in my 2018 outlook, I think chances are high for this year to be remembered as a shakeout year: a lemon market in altcoins, regulators catching up and infrastructure growing pains. Since January, the bitcoin mining hashrate (aggregate computations per second made to secure the network ) has tripled, which means that a huge amount of new or more efficient mining rigs have come online. In combination with declining prices, this means that miners who weren’t able to upgrade their machines or find cheaper electricity have been faced with a steep decline in profitability, a 90% drop in 7 months (altcoins have faced similar or steeper declines). With profit margins under heavy pressure, it’s not unlikely that miners are and will stay responsible for a significant amount of selling in the market.  Next, trading volumes are not dead, but still below those seen during last winter and spring. It’s unclear how much of the recent pick-up in volumes are the result of a short squeeze and how much is coming from new long-term buyers coming in. After last year’s FOMO, retail interest in bitcoin has now become very sluggish:  Next, here are some comments we’ve gathered from bitcoin analysts, market makers and Wall Street insiders: The first bitcoin ETF will likely not be approved before 2019. So any anticipation of approval by September will likely be met with disappointment. While institutional investors are certainly getting involved in bitcoin, the vast majority of the firms are trading firms who are looking to make markets regardless of price: they’re just as happy to take on short positions as they are to go long. Institutions who are known to be long-biased, such as mutual funds and pension funds are not ready to invest because they’re not yet comfortable with the available custody solutions. There’s also the NVM Ratio, which is designed to reflect early stage adoption, now suggesting that there’s now too little on-chain activity to justify bitcoin’s current market cap:  The assumption here is that bitcoin’s market value is mostly derived from it being a network that connects users around the world: the more people and entities use the bitcoin blockchain to settle transactions, the more it acquires the liquidity and utility that we’d expect from digital gold. The NVM ratio approximates that by measuring daily active addresses on the blockchain. Similar valuation models have been made for growth companies such as Facebook and Linkedin, where the number of monthly active users reasonably correlates with enterprise value. (There are several objections one could raise against the NVM Ratio: it doesn’t take into account transaction amounts nor the difference between old an new addresses, it doesn’t discount spam attacks, it doesn’t acknowledge limitations to the block size and neither does it consider institutions coming into the market who build derivatives on bitcoin that rely on a small amount of high-value cold storage addresses. More work is needed to refine valuation models. That said, even though bitcoin’s core value proposition is as a store of value, we do think we’re still in the early adoption phase, and hence using a valuation metric that reflects this adoption makes sense to us. In that context, we think the NVM’s on-chain activity based valuation method has merit.) The related NVT ratio, which tries to measure if the daily dollar value of all bitcoin transactions is relatively high or low versus the market cap, also suggests overvaluation. Finally, in the past few months, we’ve also seen a number of macro events that would appear to be bullish for bitcoin as a safe haven: the North Korea debacle, a spike in volatility, Chinese stocks breaking down, etc. However, these shocks didn’t move the meter for bitcoin. All this being said, lower bitcoin prices ahead are not a foregone conclusion: We think the market likely needs more time to absorb the recent 30-month rally, which could produce lower prices. We don’t foresee new all-time highs in bitcoin for 2018, and unless data starts suggesting differently, we are expecting mostly sideways or lower price action.

0," Bitcoin for coffee. It has a nice ring to it. But actually using Bitcoin (BTC) to buy coffee? Turns into a big mess real fast. However, that might be about to change. Starbucks just hinted that it might soon have a way to make using BTC to pay for coffee a whole lot easier for its loyalists. Currently, it’s possible to buy Starbucks coffee with Bitcoin, but it isn’t an easy process. The global coffee giant in the past teamed up with Square, which accepts Bitcoin. However, it isn’t as easy as whipping out your iPhone and paying with the Starbucks app or even your debit card. But will that be changing soon? According to Bloomberg, the beverage retailer has just teamed up with the world’s biggest exchange operator, Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE) to create Bakkt. Reports surfaced back in May of ICE working on a Bitcoin trading platform. This morning, ICE officially announced the creation of Bakkt. CEO of Bakkt, Kelly Loeffler, commented on her company in the press release and said: “Bakkt is designed to serve as a scalable on-ramp for institutional, merchant and consumer participation in digital assets by promoting greater efficiency, security, and utility. We are collaborating to build an open platform that helps unlock the transformative potential of digital assets across global markets and commerce.” In the press release, the company announced that it was working with Microsoft, BCG, and Starbucks on its new company Bakkt. It remains unknown how Bakkt plans on reducing the high fees associated with Bitcoin transactions, which make using Bitcoin for everyday purchases, like a cup of coffee, rather inconvenient. “As the flagship retailer, Starbucks will play a pivotal role in developing practical, trusted and regulated applications for consumers to convert their digital assets into US dollars for use at Starbucks,” said Starbucks Payments VP Maria Smith in a statement. “As a leader in Mobile Pay to our more than 15 million Starbucks Rewards members, Starbucks is committed to innovation for expanding payment options for our customers.” Many believe that this is big news for the cryptocurrency as the big question for most is, “Where can you spend it?” Currently, there seems to be some demand to make it easier to accept digital currencies, although Starbucks wouldn’t be the first retailer to accept them. Overstock.com started accepting Bitcoin back in 2014. Still, the high fees have yet to be addressed, so, we’ll just have to wait and see. Featured Image: Twitter"
0," Goldman Sachs appears to have mixed feelings towards Bitcoin. Earlier in 2018, the bank said it was planning on opening a BTC trading desk. Yesterday, a former Goldman Sachs executive said a Bitcoin ETF was possible. Yet, in the Goldman Sachs midyear economic-outlook report, Bitcoin was reported to decline even more than it has so far already this year. According to the bank’s investment strategy group, Bitcoin’s price has declined by 45% this year, and it’s not going to stop anytime soon. Why, though? Sure, we’ve all seen the price dips. However, we’ve also seen what it can do when BTC is having a good day. According to Goldman Sachs’ investment strategy group, there will be further declines in cryptocurrencies because they do not match the conventional expectations of what a currency is supposed to be. First, Bitcoin is not a medium of exchange, according to the bank. Second, cryptocurrencies are not a unit of measurement. And third, they are not a store of value. Yes and no. If you’re interested in the activity of broader financial assets, cryptocurrency declines shouldn’t impact your life too much. Why? Because “cryptocurrencies represent just 0.3% of world GDP as of mid-2018.” For the most part, the New York-based company has expressed bearish views on cryptocurrency, which lines up with the Goldman Sachs midyear economic-outlook report. Back in November, CEO Lloyd Blankfein said BTC is not a valid currency and is a way to “perpetrate fraud.” Then in January, the bank warned investors that Bitcoin was in bubble territory. Here’s where the different opinions come in. Fast forward to May of 2018 and Goldman Sachs announced its intent to launch Bitcoin futures contracts. Fast forward even more to August of 2018 and a former executive for the bank, Ali Hassan, said a Bitcoin ETF is very likely to happen. That said, Hassan did say that this will only happen once the digital asset proves it doesn’t pose a risk to investors.

NYSE Owner to Offer Federally Regulated Market for Bitcoin Featured Image: Depositphotos/© spaxiax"
0," Announced this morning is some pretty major news that Bitcoin bulls have been waiting for: Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)—the trading giant that owns the New York Stock Exchange—has a goal of breaking Bitcoin into mainstream currency and it plans to do this by forming a new company called Bakkt.  Bakkt is soon to be launched by Wall Street’s major player, but it also joins forces with some of America’s biggest companies, including Microsoft and Starbucks.  This morning ICE announced that its new company is expected to launch in November. Bakkt aims to offer a federally regulated market for Bitcoin, transforming Bitcoin into a trusted global currency with broad usage.  Yowza. As mentioned, ICE is not acting alone. The new venture also involves heavyweights in the form of Microsoft (technology), Starbucks (retail), and Boston Consulting Group (consulting). Responding to the news, Maria Smith—Vice President of Partnerships, and Payments for Starbucks—said the following about the coffee-chains involvement: “As the flagship retailer, Starbucks will play a pivotal role in developing practical, trusted and regulated applications for consumers to convert their digital assets into US dollars for use at Starbucks.” >> Crypto Daily News: Coinbase Adds British Pound and John McAfee’s “Unhackable Wallet” Gets Hacked The main goal of Bakkt is to make Bitcoin a secure offering for the biggest global financial institutions that now mostly shun it. It wants to create a path for these major money managers to offer Bitcoin mutual funds, pension funds, and ETFs as highly regulated, mainstream investments. ICE’s head of digital assets, Kelly Loeffler, will now serve as CEO of Bakkt. She had this to say regarding the company:  “Bakkt is designed to serve as a scalable on-ramp for institutional, merchant, and consumer participation in digital assets by promoting greater efficiency, security, and utility…We are collaborating to build an open platform that helps unlock the transformative potential of digital assets across global markets and commerce.” Currently, Bakkt is in preparation for launch in November.

0," With cryptocurrency mining consuming an ever-increasing amount of energy worldwide, some politicians are starting a push for higher electricity rates for miners, arguing that their activities offer “no utility for society.” Crypto mining facilities in many countries in Europe and North America enjoy the same discounted electricity rates as other data centers and traditional energy-intensive industries pay. However, some politicians are trying to include this topic in their agenda. The most recent example comes from Norway. In a segment aired by Norwegian public broadcaster NRK on Thursday, a local crypto mining firm known as KryptoVault AS were attacked by Lars Haltbrekken, a left-wing member of parliament in Norway, referring to mining as “an enormous waste of resources that perhaps could have been used for something reasonable instead.” KryptoVault’s representative, former member of parliament Gjermund Hagesæter, defended their activity by pointing out that the alternative for them and other miners in the country would be to move the mining operations to other countries with more polluting energy sources such as coal. Countries with plentiful and cheap energy coming from renewable sources have seen a large influx of crypto miners as of late, with Canada, the northeastern US, and the Nordic countries being among the most popular locations. The sentiment expressed in the debate is not unique to Norway, but can be found in countries all around the world. In March, Plattsburgh, a small town in New York State, banned the launch of new bitcoin mining firms for 18 months and in May it received a permission to impose extremely high-density load tariffs on bitcoin miners. While China is already known for its policy against bitcoin mining, in Iceland, the finance minister has warned that cryptocurrency mining could severely damage its economy.  Also, back in June, Hydro-Quebec, Canada’s biggest electricity provider, said it had temporarily suspended new requests from crypto miners after demand had reached a point where their ability to supply power to the region could be affected. Meanwhile, politicians are playing the bitcoin mining card at times when mining profitability decreased together with bitcoin prices this year. As reported by Cryptonews.com earlier, bitcoin miners have seen their profitability plummet as of late, while some miners had to unload their coins to cover some of their losses."
0," Bitcoin extended its decline and broke a key support at USD 7,400 level. BTC/USD tested an important technical support near USD 7,250 - USD 7,275, which prevented more declines. The price is currently (UTC 08:50 AM) recovering towards the USD 7,480 and USD 7,550 resistance levels. Major altcoins like ethereum, EOS and bitcoin cash are under a lot of pressure and they recently declined to new monthly lows. Bitcoin price chart: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price remained in a bearish zone and traded below the USD 7,550 and USD 7,400 support levels. However, BTC/USD tested a significant support near USD 7,275, which is likely to act as a crucial turning point. If the price starts recovering, it must clear the USD 7,550 resistance to move back in a positive zone. 
On the other hand, if the price fails to recover and breaks the USD 7,250 - USD 7,275 support, it could decline towards USD 7,000. Ethereum
Ethereum price traded to a new weekly and monthly low below USD 400. ETH/USD found support near USD 396 and later recovered. It is currently trading above USD 405 with an immediate resistance at USD 415. Above this, the next hurdle is at USD 425.
On the downside, the USD 396 - USD 400 zone holds the key support, below which, the price may perhaps slide towards USD 375. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price fell sharply and broke the USD 740 and USD 720 supports. BCH/USD tested the USD 700 support and is currently down more than 5%. If it slides further, the next support awaits at USD 675. On the upside, resistances are at USD 720 and USD 740.
Ripple price held the ground and declines were limited in XRP/USD. The pair is currently consolidating above USD 0.42 and it seems like it could correct higher in the near term. Other Altcoins Market Today
Almost all altcoins declined and posted losses, including Wanchain, Waves, WTC, PIVX, NAS, PundiX, LRC, TenX, LOOM, VeChain and Verge. The worst performer was WAN, which declined more than 20%. Overall, bitcoin is trading near a crucial support and a potential turning point. As long as BTC/USD stays above the USD 7,250 - USD 7,275 support zone, it is likely to stage a decent comeback in the near term. However, altcoins like ethereum, litecoin, EOS and bitcoin cash are likely to struggle to recover in the coming sessions."
0," With Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy proceedings now put on hold in Tokyo, a civil rehabilitation case has begun in which creditors are attempting to get back whatever is left from the collapse of the infamous exchange. In a revised version of a document dubbed “Basic Policy for the Rehabilitation Plan,” Japanese lawyers representing creditors of the Mt. Gox collapse proposed that remaining assets held by Mt. Gox should be distributed exclusively to creditors, not shareholders. Further, the lawyers propose that creditors who had bitcoins deposited on the Mt. Gox exchange at the time of the collapse, should be reimbursed in bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH).  “We are of the opinion that most of the assets, including approximately BTC 166,000 (USD 1.2bn) and 168,000 of BCH (USD 120m) and other derivatives currently held by Mt. Gox, should be paid to creditors at the time of the first payment,” according to the document. The group argues that this is the best option in order to avoid negatively affecting bitcoin prices on the open market, which could be a real possibility if the enormous pile of bitcoins held by Mt. Gox’s trustee first needs to be converted to fiat currencies. The group added that cash Mt. Gox already holds following earlier selling of BTC and BCH should be paid out to creditors in cash without first exchanging it back into cryptocurrency. With regards to altcoins, defined in the document as “cryptocurrency except for BTC and BCH,” the lawyers point out that it is “unrealistic” to repay altcoins to bitcoin creditors due to the limited number of exchanges that deals with altcoins. The document therefore proposes that altcoins should be exchanged to cash before it is paid out to creditors. The group further urges the trustee holding Mt. Gox’s assets to proceed with caution when it comes to making transactions with altcoins and selling them on the open market, citing concerns related to security and the possibility that a sale could cause “a sudden fall in the price of altcoins.” Launched in 2010, Mt. Gox handled more than 70% of bitcoin transactions worldwide at its peak, before collapsing in a spectacular fashion in 2014, causing losses amounting to hundreds of millions of US dollars."
0," If bitcoin is to one day replace the US dollar’s money supply – that is the total of all paper bills, coins, checks, etc. in circulation – its price would have to rise to at least USD 213,000, according to a new letter to clients sent out by Swiss banking giant UBS, cited by various media outlets. Joni Teves, UBS strategist, wrote in the letter that bitcoin in her view “is still too unstable and limited to become a viable means of payment or a mainstream asset class,” while also saying that the efforts by developers to address technical limitations such as scalability and speed have been “insufficient.” According to Teves, bitcoin will need additional regulatory support, as well as various consumer safeguards in order to become a future form of payment and a “legitimate asset class.”  Also, Teves found that 70% of big bitcoin price moves were results of speculative ""momentum-driven"" interest. Bitcoin price chart: The report further pointed out that bitcoin today can only process a fraction of the transaction volume that traditional payment providers like Visa can do.  However, solutions such as the Lightning network are emerging that would solve this problem. In this case, transacting and settling would be done off-blockchain, so the fees are low and thanks to the implementation of smart contracts for security, the payments can be instant - no waiting time for block confirmation. Also, another important factor is its scalability, which is supposed to make it possible for millions to billions of transactions per second to take place across the network.  Teves did not, however, address other key characteristics of bitcoin such as it being a censorship-resistant store of value, open to everyone, and free from inflation and government interference. Also, when all 21 million bitcoins are mined by the year 2140, the actual amount available to trade or spend will be significantly lower. As research by Chainalysis, a digital forensics firm that studies the bitcoin blockchain, announced last November, showed, 2.78-3.79 million bitcoins were already lost."
0," Bitcoin’s (BTC) price pullback from the recent highs above $8,500 is increasingly looking like a short-term bear market on the technical charts. The leading cryptocurrency fell to a two-week low of $7,282 earlier today on Biffinex and was last seen trading at $7,350 – down 3 percent on a 24-hour basis. The sell-off from the recent high of $8,507 had shown signs of exhaustion near $7,455 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the June low of $5,755) on Wednesday, raising prospects of a move higher to $8,000. However, BTC did not find takers on Thursday and the resulting failure to capitalize on the signs of bearish exhaustion ended up encouraging the bears to push the cryptocurrency down to two-week lows as expected. At press time, BTC has found acceptance below the key support of $7,455 and has retraced 40 percent of the rally from $5,755 to $8,507. What’s more, the cryptocurrency also closed yesterday below the former resistance-turned-support of the 100-day moving average (MA). As a result, BTC appears to have entered a short-term bear market. The price chart analysis shows the prices could drop further to $7,130. BTC closed below the 100-day MA yesterday, adding credence to the signs of a short-term bearish reversal: a bearish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs) and a downside break of the ascending trendline by the relative strength index (RSI). Moreover, the 100-day MA had acted as stiff resistance before it was taken out on July 23. It is worth noting that BTC rallied by $800 on the following day, boosting the 100-day MA’s appeal as a key technical level. Hence, the bears could be feeling emboldened, having cleared the 100-day MA support yesterday. Further, BTC has also dropped below $7,455 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement), which served as good support earlier this week. And last but not the least, the relative strength index (RSI) has dipped below 50.00 (in bearish territory). Clearly, the tide has turned in favor of the bears – at least for the short-term – and a further drop could be on the cards, albeit after a re-test of the 100-day MA of $7,583.  The RSI is hovering below 30.00, indicating oversold conditions and the chart also shows a bullish divergence of the RSI. Hence, a minor rally to $7,583–$7,600 cannot be ruled out, although the gains will likely be short-lived, courtesy of the bearish setup on the daily chart.

0," Bitcoin mining rig manufacturer Canaan Creative has reportedly come up with a creative new way for ordinary people to mine bitcoins by using their TV sets. With a hashing power of 2.8 trillion hashes per second, the company is betting on increased retail demand for bitcoin mining rigs, the South China Morning Post reported. However, the new TV set, known under the name AvalonMiner Inside, is still a far cry from the company’s most powerful bitcoin mining machine in terms of computing power – the AvalonMiner 841 with 13 trillion hashes per second, that retails for USD 618. The report did not specify, when the 43-inch TV set is going to be available in the market and how much it would cost. According to cryptocompare.com, a machine with a hashing power of 2.8 trillion hashes per second could mine BTC 0.04319 (USD 331 at current prices) per year. However, the report did not specify power consumption numbers. Canaan’s TV set can reportedly be controlled by voice commands and is able to calculate bitcoin mining profitability in real time. The new product is the first in a planned new range of blockchain-related home appliances from Canaan, the newspaper wrote. Although it is certainly a creative idea, early reactions from the bitcoin community reveals some skepticism. Beijing-based bitcoin analyst Xiao Lei was quoted in the article as saying “it looks more like a hype. It will be more meaningful if these companies are able to embed the mining function into existing major TV brands.” Canaan Creative is the world’s second biggest maker of bitcoin mining rigs, following Bitmain Technologies. Both companies are headquartered in Beijing, China. The news comes after Canaan earlier this year filed an application to list the company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, where the hardware maker is aiming to raise up to USD 1 billion through an initial public offering (IPO). Canaan reported revenues of USD 205 million last year, an increase of an astonishing 27 times from the year before. The company sold nearly 300,000 mining machines last year, with the US and Sweden being among its biggest markets.  According to figures from the company’s IPO application, Canaan’s mining machines accounted for approximately 20% of bitcoin hashing power globally in 2017."
0," Bitcoin found a strong buying interest near the USD 7,450 - USD 7,500 zone and started an upward move. BTC/USD is currently correcting higher with a minor bullish angle. However, there are many resistances near the USD 7,750 and USD 7,800 levels, waiting to prevent gains. Overall, it seems like bitcoin bears are losing grip, but bulls are struggling to take control. On the other hand, major altcoins like ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash remained in the red zone.  Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is trading flat near the USD 7,650 level with an immediate resistance at USD 7,700. Above this, BTC/USD could test a significant resistance near the USD 7,800 level, which is likely to protect more upsides in the short term. Should bitcoin bulls succeed in clearing the USD 7,800 wall, the price may recover nicely above USD 8,000.
Conversely, if the price fails to move above USD 7,700 and USD 7,800, it may perhaps resume its slide back towards the USD 7,500 and USD 7,400 support levels. Ethereum
Ethereum price extended its slide towards the USD 400 level and traded close to USD 405. ETH/USD is currently consolidating gains above USD 410, but it remains at a risk of more declines.
On the upside, the price needs to clear the USD 430 and USD 440 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. The next resistances are at USD 450 and USD 455. Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash price held the yesterday’s low near USD 735 and it mostly traded in a range above the USD 750 level. BCH/USD may possibly recover in the short term if buyers gain traction above the USD 780 resistance level. Supports are at USD 750 and USD 740.
Ripple price is stable near the USD 0.44 level with range moves. XRP/USD attempted a close above USD 0.45, but it failed to retain gains. It seems like the price is preparing for another attempt to clear the USD 0.45 and USD 0.46 resistances. Other altcoins market today
A few altcoins recovered during the past few hours, including KickCoin, ChainLink, TenX, ETP, Dropil, EMC, Bitcoin Private, Populous and DCR. Out of these, KickCoin and ChainLink performed really well with 25% and 12% gains respectively. To sum up, bitcoin price is currently in a recovery mode above USD 7,600. However, BTC/USD is likely to face a strong selling interest near the USD 7,800 resistance (the previous support)."
0," Having defended the key support of $7,455, the bitcoin bulls now need a quick move higher in order to neutralize the threat of a short-term bearish reversal. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,560 on Bitfinex – down 11 percent from the recent high of $8,507. However, that still marks a gain of more than 30 percent from the June 24 low of $5,755. So, it is safe to say the bullish trend is still intact. Further, BTC’s solid defense of $7,455 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the June low) seen in the last 28 hours has raised the prospect of a minor corrective rally. However, the bulls have little margin for error and the upside needs to gather traction soon as the short-duration technical studies have already adopted a bearish bias, as seen in the chart below. The bearish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs) indicates a short-term bearish setup. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has breached the key ascending trendline in favor of the bears.  The 50-hour, 100-hour, and 200-hour MAs are trending south and are located one below the other, indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. Meanwhile, the RSI has dropped below 50.00 (in bearish territory). Clearly, the short-term charts are aligned in favor of the bears. So, there is a real risk of BTC falling below the crucial support of $7,455 in the next 24 hours. Moreover, acceptance below that level would only bolster the already bearish setup discussed above and would confirm a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.

0," The internet delivers.  So here’s what happens. Paul Krugman is a big deal in the business world. He’s a Nobel Prize winner in Economics, Distinguished Professor of Economics at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and a columnist for The New York Times.
He’s also a crypto skeptic. In his latest column for the New York Times, he argues that cryptocurrency is at least 300 years behind the current, let’s call it traditional monetary system.  He says crypto is too expensive to create, transactions are frictive, costs of doing business are high. On the other hand, conventional money ‘generally does its job very well’, he argues.  “Transaction costs are low. The purchasing power of a dollar a year from now is highly predictable – orders of magnitude more predictable than that of a Bitcoin. Using a bank account means trusting a bank, but by and large banks justify that trust, far more so than the firms that hold cryptocurrency tokens.” He acknowledges, that he might be wrong and ends his article this way: ""If you want to argue that I’m wrong, please answer the question, what problem does cryptocurrency solve? Don’t just try to shout down the skeptics with a mixture of technobabble and libertarian derp."" The internet replied, in kind.  Truth be told, most of the answers revolved around discrediting Krugman, without really answering the question. Once again, people started pulling out his old predictions, like when he said that the internet’s effect on the economy by 2005 will be no greater than the fax machine’s. (Same argument was used in 2013, when Krugman wrote a piece called ""Bitcoin is Evil"". Later, he told Business Insider that ""the fact that people are throwing around my 98 quote actually shows that they don't get this point — that they're confusing technology with monetary economics."")   Others were straight-up savage, like this redditor who said: “That's a bullish sign, that guy is always wrong,” or one person on Twitter that stated “another old man yells at bitcoin.” But there were also more concrete answers. Some tried to keep it short and concise, for everyone to understand: “At the simplest level it solves irreversible value transfer at a distance without a middle man.” Others have stated that bitcoin can move hundreds of millions of dollars internationally, in under ten minutes, for less than a dollar in fees. “What are the comparable options with the traditional system?” they ask.  “Krugman claims fiat transaction cost are low. In reality the fiat payment systems cost us 2% of GDP, which is quite a huge amount in absolute terms. It makes the economy less efficient, payment cost are friction losses in an economy and eat up profits and revenue. 2% is about two thirds of annual growth rate, so current transaction cost are a real problem. Bitcoin can reduce that by at least one order of magnitude.”  CIO and Managing Partner of BlockTower Capital, a cryptocurrency investment firm, Ari Paul, answered the question on Twitter, saying: You wrote an article about being skeptical of the value of Bitcoin without even addressing its core value propositions: censorship resistance and judgement resistance.  These have trillions with a T demand as we can see by the size of the offshore banking system. While others suggested that someone has to tell Krugman about non-custodial wallets:  ""Using a bank account means trusting a bank, but by and large banks justify that trust, far more so than the firms that hold cryptocurrency tokens.""🤔 hmmm ... should someone tell him about non-custodial wallets? However, Krugman did not elaborate whether those replies answer his question."
0," After a week-long battle between bulls and bears about the next move for bitcoin prices, the bulls lost their grip on Tuesday, sending bitcoin down more than 5%. Early trading on Wednesday confirmed the move, shredding off another 2.5%, according to price data from Coinbase.  The most popular cryptocurrency has now broken out of the range it has been trading in since the latest price rally occurred on Tuesday last week. As of press time, bitcoin is trading around the USD 7,530 level on the same exchange.  Judging from technical analysis, the price is now close to the USD 7,350 - USD 7,450-area where it consolidated between July 18 and 22, which may provide crucial support for another leg up. The support area in the chart coincides with the 100-day moving average (blue line) - a widely followed trading indicator. Bitcoin prices have historically reacted in a strong way, both up and down, whenever this line is crossed. Also worth noting is that the popular Relative Strength Index (RSI) has now come down from “overbought” levels, as indicated by a reading above 70, to a “neutral” zone of about 50. With all the positive news of institutional interest in bitcoin that has come out recently, the next few days will be a crucial test of whether traders, just like the big players, believe that the bottom in bitcoin is already behind us."
0," Bitcoin’s price posted gains in the first month of the third quarter, snapping the longest losing streak it’s seen in nearly two years. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose 20 percent in July, having registered losses in the previous two months – the first instance of back-to-back monthly drops since August 2016. At press time, bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $7,580, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  At first instance, the rally seen in July may appear corrective in nature as BTC was looking oversold at the end of Q2, courtesy of a 58 percent drop in the first six months of the year. However, a detailed look at crypto market metrics reveals the July rally had substance. To start with, the BTC dominance rate surged in July as prices recovered from the yearly lows below 6,000, indicating the investors are likely betting on a sustained rally in BTC and are not merely buying the leading cryptocurrency to rotate money into other innovations.  Secondly, trading volumes showed signs of life, adding credence to BTC’s inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal. The average daily trading volume in July was $4.56 billion – up 5.11 percent compared to the average daily trading volume of $4.34 billion seen in June, according to CoinMarketCap data. Also, the average daily trading volume rose for the first time in July after three straight monthly declines. Clearly, BTC looks primed for further gains after July’s 20 percent price rise. Still, the bulls need to adopt a cautious stance as the major part of the rally was likely fueled by expectations that institutional money would flow into cryptocurrency waters if the US SEC approves bitcoin exchange-traded-funds (ETFs). Thus, a BTC rally could unravel if the SEC rejects proposals for ETF approval. We have already seen the trailer of what could happen if the SEC continues to play spoilsport. For instance, BTC prices fell sharply from $8,200 to $7,900 last Thursday on SEC’s rejection of the Winklevoss bitcoin ETF and more importantly, the bullish momentum has weakened since Friday. Looking ahead, BTC could continue to rise as increasing calls for bitcoin ETF will likely keep the cryptocurrency in demand. The technical studies are also biased toward the bulls.  Bitcoin cleared the falling channel last week, signaling the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached in December has ended. What bulls need now is a convincing move through the 50-week moving average (MA), currently located at $8,430. If scaled, the cryptocurrency will likely attack $10,000 in a couple of weeks.

0," Bitcoin (BTC) could be in for a minor bout of consolidation following an 11 percent drop from recent highs above $8,500. At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,570 on Bitfinex, having clocked a nine-day low of $7,469 earlier today. A minor correction was overdue, though, as BTC had looked overbought a week ago at the two-month high of $8,507. Things took a turn for the worse in the last 24 hours, as BTC’s overlong sideways action ended with a downside break and the bargain hunters failed to turn up at the key support of $7,800. As a result, the cryptocurrency ended up retracing more than 35 percent of the rally from the June 24 low of $5,755. Clearly, the tide has turned in favor of the bears in the last 24 hours, although oversold conditions and indecisiveness seen in the short duration charts will likely keep the cryptocurrency range-bound in the next 24 hours.  The above chart shows BTC has created a doji candle at the key support of $7,455 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement), indicating indecision in the market. A minor corrective rally to $7,800 could be on the cards if the current 4-hour candle closes above the previous doji candle’s high of $7,587. The relative strength index (RSI) is holding well below 30.00, signaling oversold conditions. So, this appears to be the most likely scenario. That said, the gains will likely be short-lived as 5-candle and 10-candle moving averages (MAs) are trending south, indicating a bearish setup. Further, the cryptocurrency has found acceptance below the key support of $7,815 (July 27 low), meaning the bears are in control. Acceptance below the immediate support of $7,456 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement) would strengthen the bear case, although oversold conditions are seen capping losses around $7,400.

0," Bitcoin bears may be in the midst of taking an upper-hand. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $7,536 on Bitfinex, down 6.9 percent on the day, a figure that also finds the price breaking a key support level at $7,800. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been largely confined to a narrow price range of $7,673–$7,800, since it broke $8,000 yesterday. However, mounting sell volume continues to apply downward pressure, presenting a bleak outlook for bulls looking to take back the reins. As such, bulls now are looking for 24-hour volume in excess of 2.4 billion, a threshold that would inspire hope of a reversal.   For those eyeing the charts, the extenuated bearish MACD demonstrates high price volatility and negative price action with the signal line (orange line) continuing to plow under. The above chart shows:  The hourly Relative Strength Index (RSI) tells of a fight currently playing out between the bulls and bears as it hangs at 23.142 at press time, presenting a possible weak bullish divergence before the closing period. If it drops below 22.745 it would expose the lowest levels in three weeks – since July 10. This would create a short-term rebound whereby price action would need to be reassessed.

0," Online bank Swissquote opened its banking doors to accommodate Bitcoin trading accounts for its clients in July of 2017. It was thought to be the first European online bank to do this. A year on, and Swissquote has revealed the fruits of its labor for adopting the cryptocurrency with a 44% surge in profits attributed to the “Crypto Boom” in the early half of 2018. According to Finews, the online bank’s massive growth in Q1 2018 was thanks to a “brisk demand” for crypto products and the eruption of the crypto markets earlier this year. >>CEO of Fatfish Internet: Crypto ETF Coming Soon, Despite Recent Rejections The profit was $26.01 million in the first half of 2018 representing a whopping 44% increase over the previous year. The bank sharply increased in trader activity and new customer accounts also.  But this is not the first time, the bank has seen its earnings soar because of Bitcoin. In January it was “swamped with interest” in Bitcoin trading as, according to Swissquote, “several thousand new account applications [were] being submitted every week.” >>IBM Blockchain Platform Targets Banks and Financial Institutions To be more precise, in the first half of 2018, the number of customer accounts in Swissquote’s commercial sector increased by 16,278. But not only an increase in accounts, the bank saw the average transaction amount grow to 11.8 transactions, which is a considerable jump when compared to the previous year’s one transaction over the same period. Since beginning its cryptocurrency adoption in 2017 with Bitcoin, Swissquote expanded its offering and by December 2017, it had added support for four other major cryptocurrencies; Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash. Last March, it introduced an exchange-traded product (ETP) that tracks a multi-cryptocurrency index. Swissquote’s crypto ETP is listed on the country’s largest stock exchange, the Six Swiss Exchange.

0," Private investors in the U.S. are still not showing serious signs of interest in bitcoin, according to a new report. However, it's the smaller investors, those whose investments are below 100,000 USD, who know more about the most popular cryptocurrency and are the most intrigued by it. But this comes with a twist - despite they're intrigued, they won't be buying bitcoin soon.  The report, courtesy of Wells Fargo, an American bank, and Gallup, an American management consulting company, draws a correlation between these smaller investors and their age, saying younger males are more familiar with cryptocurrencies than seniors and women. The report also says that younger males are also those who can’t afford to invest much – this is a category with less than 100,000 USD in investments.  This second quarter report is entitled Wells Fargo/Gallup Investor and Retirement Optimism Index survey, and was conducted in May, among almost 2,000 U.S. adults with 10,000 USD or more invested in stocks, bonds or mutual funds, within or outside a retirement savings account. The report paints a picture of a digital asset that’s yet to make significant gains among investors of any kind. It says that just three percent of men and one percent of women own bitcoin. Three percent of those aged 18 to 49, and one percent of those aged 50 and above. Bitcoin is more present among the wealthier population, but even there it’s fairly slim: just three percent of those earning 90,000 USD or more have bitcoin. Among those with lower income, just one percent.  So, what’s holding bitcoin back? According to this report, the risk factor. Three in four investors (75%) consider bitcoin to be a ‘very risky’ investment, with another 23% saying it’s ‘somewhat risky’. Just two percent consider it ‘not too risky’, leaving none saying it’s not risky at all.  The report concludes that most U.S. investors prefer to play it safe with their investments, opting for security over growth. But the younger generation, intrigued by the technology, might drive it forward, faster."
0," During the past three sessions, there were mostly range moves in bitcoin below the USD 8,250 resistance area. There were a couple of swing moves, but dips in BTC/USD were well bid around the USD 7,800 and USD 8,000 support levels. On the other hand, most major altcoins like ethereum, ripple, litecoin and bitcoin cash traded with a minor bearish angle and declined between 3% - 8%. Going forward, bitcoin may continue to trade in a range before buyers make an attempt to break the USD 8,250 resistance. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price struggled on many occasions to break the USD 8,250 and USD 8,300 resistance levels. BTC/USD declined, but it remained supported on the downside. It seems like the price is trading in a broad range of USD 7,800- USD 8,250 (UTC 08:30 AM). 
Therefore, it will either break the USD 8,250 resistance to accelerate higher or it could decline below the USD 7,800 support to extend the current correction wave. Ethereum
Ethereum price is down more than 3% and it broke the USD 465 and USD 450 support levels. ETH/USD is currently under pressure and it seems like it may perhaps decline further towards the USD 435 support.
On the upside, the previous support at USD 460 is now a key resistance for a recovery. Above this, the most important resistance is near USD 475. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price is also down more than 3% and is currently struggling to hold the USD 800 support. BCH/USD may continue to decline towards the USD 780 support, below which, the next major support awaits at USD 750. On the upside, the USD 830 and USD 840 levels are crucial hurdles for buyers.
Ripple price extended declines and broke an important support at USD 0.450. XRP/USD is now at a risk of more losses towards the USD 0.420 level in the near term. Resistances are at USD 0.450, USD 0.460 and USD 0.475. Other Altcoins Market Today
Almost all small cap altcoins declined recently, including Mithril, MOAC, ChainLink, Wanchain, ONT, WTC, ADA, ICON and IOST. However, Polymath performed well as it climbed by more than 30% and broke the USD 0.50 resistance. A major cryptocurrency exchange, Binance listed POLY, which ignited bullish moves. To sum up, bitcoin must stay above the range support at USD 7,800. If not, there is a risk of a bearish reaction. On the flip side, if BTC/USD starts an upward move, altcoins could recover from the red zone."
0," There are so many ways to raise awareness of cryptocurrency amongst the masses. You could let people buy stuff with crypto on the world's biggest online stores, or you could build a decentralized social network where people would be in control of their data and where they could get a small cut of the revenue from ads, in crypto. Or, you know, you could just shove a bitcoin into Kim Kardashian's hands and let her Instagram do the hard work.  That's basically what happened two days ago, during the First Annual City of Hope Charity Poker Tournament. Matthew Roszak, co-founder and chairman at blockchain technology company Bloq (among other things), gave Kim K a bitcoin to gamble with and obviously, she posted it on her Instagram story, while he took to Twitter.  Big fun at the First Annual @cityofhope Charity Poker Tournament — also gave @KimKardashian her very first #bitcoin — KardashianCoin, YeezyCoin? — check out #tokenizationofthings: https://t.co/hvWphu6Wxm pic.twitter.com/fOdxDe4jO7 ______ Not to underestimate Matthew and his 13,500 Twitter followers, but they are all (more or less) already acquainted with crypto. Among Kim K's 114 million followers, we bet there is at least 13,500 people that weren't aware of the revolutionary technology that cryptocurrencies are. The move pushed Reddit (and the media, too!) into a frenzy. Crypto subreddits were flowing with creative juices, with one person commenting “This was the confirmation I was looking for that I’ve made a sound financial decision,” while others were more interested in seeing the results. “Kim Kardashian could be the catalyst to get this bull market going,” and “This is better than you think it is,” were some of the comments.  Kim may not build a super revolutionary blockchain-based product that’s going to turn the market on its head, but even by mentioning it on Instagram, she’s created plenty of buzz which is always good for the market. One of the Redditors has made, perhaps the most precise of all comments: 
“This was posted more times than the global market cap.” “This was posted more times than the global market cap.” And that’s what it is all about. Now let’s wait for results."
0," Bitcoin’s 26 percent rally left many a cryptocurrency in the dust over the course of July. Indeed, the bitcoin dominance rate, a widely used indicator that tracks the percentage of the total crypto market cap contributed by bitcoin, rose to 48 percent, up from 42 percent, to record a 7-month high over the 31-day period, a function of money shifting from alternative cryptocurrencies into bitcoin.  That said, not every alternative cryptocurrency saw gains. Ether, the cryptocurrency that powers the ethereum blockchain, and the second-largest cryptocurrency by total value, as an example, recorded a monthly loss. A notable exception among the largest 25 cryptocurrencies reviewed by CoinDesk, however, was stellar’s XLM token, which was able to defy the odds and become the top monthly performer in its class. Fueled by interest from the most influential U.S. exchange, Coinbase, the news the startup is considering an XLM listing revved up investor interest, spiking 13 percent on the news. Still, it’s arguable that this simply helped galvanize stellar’s appeal after notable recent milestones. In recent months, teams seeking to launch initial coin offerings (ICOs), including social messenger Kik, have begun to utilize stellar’s technology. Also notable has been the team’s technical commitments, such as its prominent support for the scaling solution, lightning network, which developers say they aim to implement this year. Along the ride, stellar would go on to hold its gains, though, eventually displacing litecoin to become the world’s sixth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization – valued today just north of $5 billion. Monthly performance: +40 percent
All-time high: $0.90
Closing price on June 30: $0.19
Current market price: $0.27
Rank as per market capitalization: 6 XLM began its monthly ascent on July 13 (Coinbase news), reaching its monthly high of $0.36 12 days later when it showed a 93 percent gain from the month’s open of $0.19.  Still, the crypto asset cooled off during the last week of the July, dropping 11 percent, likely due to overextended technical charts and a wavering bitcoin price. When July came to a close, Stellar finalized its 40 percent month-to-month appreciation.  Price closed above the two-month long descending trendline (yellow) on July 14, a bullish signal seen in the chart above, and continued its journey past the 200 day exponential moving average to the 0.618 Fibonacci Retracement (from May high of $0.47). Its monthly high mark of $0.36 was set shortly after on July 25. The combination of resistances proved to be too strong as price failed to find acceptance above the levels, first hinted by bearish divergence in the daily RSI. Price consequently reversed over 24 percent to where it stands today just below $0.28.  Only a daily close below the long term trendline (blue) would return the immediate trend to bearish favor and suggest a move towards the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement located near $0.23. On the upside, a bounce off of the trendline could be seen as a successful throwback test and would add credence to the bullish trend change, setting sights back on the elusive $0.36 resistance.

0," Bitcoin’s price risks deeper losses below $8,000 as the bears seem to be winning a four-day-long tug-of-war with the bulls. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $7,950 on Bitfinex – down 2 percent in the last 24 hours – having clocked a low of $7,930 earlier today. The cryptocurrency has been largely restricted to a narrow range of $8,300–$8,050 since late Friday. Consequently, the Bollinger bandwidth – a volatility indicator – dropped today to the lowest level since October, as per the short duration technical chart. Hence, we could be in for a big move, as a prolonged period of low volatility (range-bound activity) usually makes way for a big move on either side. Further, the big move (if it does materialize) could happen to the downside as the bull case has weakened following BTC’s failure to capitalize on a descending broadening channel breakout witnessed on Friday.  The above chart shows: Clearly, the technical chart is aligned in favor of the bears. Further, the decline could be sharp, a key volatility gauge indicates.  The volatility, as represented by the Bollinger bandwidth (gap between the bands) on the 4-hour chart, fell today to its lowest level since October. As stated earlier, an extended period of low volatility is usually followed by a big move, which is seen happening to the downside. As a result, BTC could suffer a deeper drop below the $8,000 mark.

0," Kim Kardashian promotes Bitcoin: Reality television star Kim Kardashian-West announced to her 114 million Instagram (IG) followers that she staked a physical Bitcoin (BTC) in a charity poker event in LA last night. West’s sisters, Kendall Jenner and Khloe Kardashian, along with their mother Kris Jenner, hosted a table at yesterday’s ‘If Only’ Texas Hold’Em Charity Poker event. This charity event was geared towards raising funds for the City of Hope, a nonprofit clinical research and treatment center for cancer. During the poker event, Kim Kardashian West video recorded all of her poker chips showing how much she had put into the event. The next video showed that she had “moved onto Bitcoin.” Crypto entrepreneur Matt Roszak attended the City of Hope event and claimed that he gave Kardashian-West the physical Bitcoin shown in Kim’s IG pictures above.

Still, she holds 114 million followers on Instagram that have potentially just been introduced to Bitcoin for the very first time. The rest of the TV star’s IG story, however, had nothing to do with cryptocurrency and more to do with how “skinny” she looked—figures. We should see this as a win for crypto, despite the short mention and zero explanation. >> How To Invest in Bitcoin  According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin (BTC) didn’t see a spike in price within the last 24 hours as one would have expected from the celebrity endorsement. It may have been that Kim’s viewers had no idea how to even invest in Bitcoin. At press time, BTC is trading at $8,048.22 a coin, down -1.77%, in 24 hours. Featured Image: Twitter"
0," This past week, we saw a solid upward move in bitcoin price above the USD 8,000 level. BTC/USD pair traded towards USD 8,500 before correcting lower. It corrected below USD 8,000, found support near USD 7,800, and recovered back above USD 8,100. It seems like bitcoin is preparing for the next rally above the USD 8,250 and USD 8,300 resistance levels. Similarly, major altcoins like ethereum, ripple, EOS and bitcoin cash are trading above key supports and are likely to move higher in the coming sessions. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently trading (UTC 09:00 AM) in a tiny range near the USD 8,150 level with an immediate resistance at USD 8,250. Above this, BTC/USD must clear the USD 8,300 and USD 8,320 resistance levels to set the pace for a fresh upward move towards USD 8,500 or higher in the near term.
On the downside, the USD 8,050 support is a key hurdle for sellers, below which, the last swing at USD 7,800 is likely to hold losses in bitcoin. Ethereum
Ethereum price is trading in a contracting range below USD 475 resistance. ETH/USD is facing critical resistances near the USD 475 and USD 485 levels, above which, the price may rally above USD 515.
On the downside, there is a significant support near USD 450 - USD 455. Should there be a break below USD 450, the price may perhaps move back towards the USD 425 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price is forming a solid support near the USD 800 level. BCH/USD is slowly moving higher and is currently trading above the USD 820 level. A break above the USD 840 resistance will most likely clear the path for more upsides towards the USD 880 and USD 900 levels. Weekly supports are at USD 800, USD 750 and USD 720.
Ripple price is consolidating above the USD 0.450 support. It seems like XRP/USD is forming a base for a large upward move above USD 0.475 in the near term. Resistances are at USD 0.475, USD 0.480 and USD 0.500. Other Altcoins Market Today
Most small cap altcoins traded in range with tiny bullish moves. However, ChainLink and RChain are gaining bullish momentum and are up 10% and 5% respectively. A few other coins like AE, Verge, MCO and ETC are also gaining traction today. Overall, bitcoin is trading with a bullish bias and it could break higher above USD 8,300 and USD 8,500 in the coming days. Altcoins like ethereum and ripple may possibly follow a slow and steady bullish structure, targeting a recovery between 8-15%."
0," Bitcoin is as a “technological experiment” that is “much less risky at USD 7,800 or wherever it is today, than it was when it was at USD 100,” Bill Miller, the founder and chief investment officer of investment firm Miller Value Partners, said in a recent interview on Bloomberg TV.  The veteran investor – who claims to have bought bitcoin at an average price of about USD 300 – added that “for each day that it doesn’t blow up or gets regulated out of existence, more money is gonna flow into the ecosystem.” Speaking of altcoins, Miller said that “there are 1,600 cryptocurrencies out there, and I would say most of them are probably worthless […] I think bitcoin has the greatest probability of being successful,” adding that he sees Ethereum as a close second runner in this race. The investor also said that the best way to think of bitcoin is as a “non-correlated asset most similar to gold…except that it’s much more easily transportable than gold […] and it can actually be used to buy things.” Miller further explained that if bitcoin were to become a third as valuable as gold, central banks would start looking at it as another asset to potentially hold in the same way they hold gold today, adding “that would open the market up extremely significantly.”

0," Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is consolidating in a narrow range at press time and could regain bullish momentum above $8,350, technical charts indicate. The leading cryptocurrency moved back above $8,000 on Friday as expected and was seen rising to recent highs above $8,500 over the weekend. However, BTC has traded in a sideways manner in the last 60 hours. The upside has been capped around $8,300 and dips to $8,050 have been short-lived, according to Bitfinex data. Despite the bull breakout, the price consolidation has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook, yet it is still too early to call a bearish reversal. Further, buyers may feel emboldened if the $250 trading range is breached to the upside, resulting in a resumption of the rally. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,170 on Bitfinex.  BTC witnessed a descending broadening channel breakout on Friday – a continuation pattern – which signaled a revival of the rally and opened the doors to a re-test of $8,507 (July 24 high). However, the bullish move failed to materialize and the cryptocurrency ended up creating a sideways channel over the weekend, as seen in the above chart. An upside break of the sideways channel now would validate the descending broadening channel breakout and allow a rally to 200-day moving average (MA) of $8,468. On the other hand, a move back into the descending broadening channel could prove costly. That said, the probability of a bullish breakout of the sideways channel is high as the major moving averages are biased toward the bulls. For instance, the 50-candle, 100-candle, and 200-candle MA are trending north and located one below the other.  The relative strength index (RSI) is no longer reporting overbought conditions, meaning there is room for a rally to recent highs above $8,500 on the upside break of the sideways channel seen in the 4-hour chart. Further, the 10-day MA continues to rise in a bullish manner. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing. Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; Charts by Trading View"
0," If cryptocurrency is decentralizing the world of money, a new bitcoin wallet startup thinks it could also help decentralize the world of work. Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Misthos launched its multi-signature wallet Monday on top of Blockstack‘s decentralized application platform. One of the first enterprise products launched on Blockstack, the wallet is designed for project teams, investment partnerships and other ad hoc ventures to manage the divvying up of income (received as bitcoin) among their individual members. These organizations, which often form to carry out a specific objective before disbanding (more like a Hollywood production than a corporation), “want to have transparency into where their cash is going and want to be able to distribute their income in a fair way,” Misthos founder Justin Carter told CoinDesk. To that end, all proposed payouts from a venture using a Misthos wallet must be approved unanimously by the partners in that venture. Carter described this model as “moving away from an employee-employer relationship to a group consensus about who contributed value.” In other words, instead of a getting paid according to a salary or contract negotiated before taking on a job, the individual is compensated based on social consensus among the team. Misthos makes its money by collecting a 1.49 percent cut of the payouts. Similarly, proposals to add partners are subject to approval by all the existing participants, and in order to kick one person out, everyone else in the group must agree to it. Several partnerships are already using Misthos to distribute bitcoin among members, including the four-person team behind Munich-based bitcoin publication Coin Trainer. “It helps us create a transparent environment where contributions are rewarded fairly and democratically,” Marcel Kasper, one of the co-founders of Coin Trainer, told CoinDesk. Eventually, this collaborative model could be applied to managing fiat currency income for projects as well, but bitcoin was a natural starting point, Carter said. “We are starting to build out the product on bitcoin is because of the reduced friction, as we have no institutional dependencies,” he told CoinDesk, adding: “Crypto-first is about first developing a financial service for the new platform (cryptocurrencies). And once the overall experience is well-defined, adapting it to the old platforms, integrating with legacy financial institutions operating in fiat.” Misthos is part of a broader push across the cryptocurrency community to support less centralized employment models. Opolis, for example, is a professional employment organization (PEO) that handles outsourced human resources functions such as benefits and payroll for employers. However, it caters to a specialized clientele, including blockchain projects and startups, and has close ties to ConsenSys, the ethereum design studio. By the end of the month, roughly 300 Opolis users will be able to facilitate crypto or fiat payrolls, employee benefits, and tax documents through this one-stop-shop service provider. The company also runs an employment marketplace for recruiters and job seekers, and it has a grander vision of future “decentralized employment organizations,” or DEOs. John Paller, a co-founder of Opolis, told CoinDesk his platform is optimized for individual contractors instead of corporate hierarchies. “[Freelancers] can choose and vote on any benefits they want, any number of things, including things that are out of the scope of traditional options today,” he said. “For example, you could have part of your income go to a group investment model.” Both Misthos and Opolis use decentralized data solutions of some kind for worker IDs and credentials, making it easier to recruit, onboard and offboard collaborators. “There’s also storage that Blockstack provides, and part of that we’re leveraging,” Carter said of Misthos, which uses Blockstack IDs for logins and wallet management. “All the history of the ventures is all stored with the individual partners.” Stepping back, it’s easy to see why these entrepreneurs see an opportunity in offering solutions tailored for project-specific, flexible employment arrangements. These days many of the ecosystem’s leading developers prefer to work independently. Turnover at crypto startups is particularly high. Indeed, Wall Street veteran turned startup advisor Jill Carlson told CoinDesk a wide range of workers with soft skills could benefit from employment opportunities modeled after open source collaborations. In traditional freelance contract negotiations, “You have very little leverage,” Carlson said. “I want to be able to do this style of work but to scale it in some way.” On the other hand, Carlson also emphasized the importance of training and mentorship provided by traditional employers. To bring bitcoin’s ethos to the workplace, some collaboration will need to take place offline, face-to-face. “I do my best work when I’m with other people,” she said. Plus, in her view, it’s important to consider how crypto community politics, and arguments on social media platforms where “a lot of nuance is being lost,” could impact project governance on Misthos, which she nevertheless said offers a compelling idea for on-chain bounty management. Carter agreed that much of the social governance will take place off of the Misthos payroll platform. “The point Misthos steps in is for a form of documentation and execution,” he said. This is why Jude Nelson, lead blockchain engineer at Blockstack, told CoinDesk such democratic projects will require both on-chain and off-chain coordination. He concluded: “On-chain smart contracts are likely necessary for users of a dapp who don’t know each other. But since all partners in a Misthos venture must know one another before signing off on a payment, they are able to coordinate pay-outs off-chain without needing a potentially cumbersome on-chain smart contract.” Men and coins image via Shutterstock"
1," Bitcoin has had quite the year. It hasn’t all been good, with the digital currency dropping below the $6,000 price mark at the end of June. But recently Bitcoin has redeemed itself, witnessing strong gains over the last week. So that brings up the question of whether there are catalysts driving Bitcoin higher. If not now, could there be catalysts at a later date? Spencer Bogart, the co-founder of Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm, seems to think so. There is a better atmosphere in the crypto industry right now. For the first time in a while, people are looking at the BTC price and feeling hopeful, reminiscent. Erik Voorhees is one of these people. Welcome back $8000 🙂 #bitcoin — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) July 24, 2018  But that doesn’t mean Bitcoin is where it should be, nor is it close to previous levels, like its high of $19,783.21, achieved in December of last year. Spencer Bogart, a former Bitcoin analyst, recognizes this, and yet, he told CNBC on Wednesday that he still expects “to see new highs.” But how? If people are edging away from Bitcoin and towards other cryptocurrencies, how will Bitcoin move higher than $9,000? $10,000? Well, according to Bogart, there are a few potential catalysts driving Bitcoin higher. 1. A Potential Bitcoin ETF A few days ago, Bitwise announced that it had filed with the SEC for an ETF that would track less than a dozen cryptocurrencies, with one being Bitcoin. Members of the company said that at the rate the market is moving, there’s a chance the SEC would “allow a crypto ETF onto the market.” (However, given recent light, this may still not be happening any time soon.) 2. Increasing Currency Rates 3. Mastercard’s New Patent Earlier this month, Mastercard announced a new patent regarding Bitcoin transactions. As a result, consumers may one day be charging their purchases (coffee, shopping, travel, you name it!) on their credit cards using Bitcoin (BTC). 4. Global Trade Tensions Overall, Bogart considers Bitcoin to be a “tinderbox” at the moment. In his interview with CNBC, Bogart concluded that the Bitcoin (BTC) price is “waiting for reasons to go higher.” Is he right, though? Both about the catalysts driving Bitcoin higher and that the currency is “waiting” to soar? At press time, Bitcoin is selling for $8,202.29, which puts BTC down 0.08% in the past twenty-four hours. >> Crypto Daily News: Crypto Market Falls and CME Altcoin Futures Put On Hold Featured image: annca via Pixabay"
1," One technical indicator is pointing to the beginning of a new prolonged rally in bitcoin prices, according to research by Bloomberg.  The Directional Movement Index (DMI) is a tool traders use to assess the direction and strength of price movements in financial assets, and it is currently showing the largest positive divergence since the explosive rally of December last year. The strong DMI reading indicates that the current rally is more significant than previous rallies we have seen this year, possibly leading to a reversal in the overall bearish trend for bitcoin. Meanwhile, hedge fund manager Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek Capital Management said in an interview with TheStreet.com that he expects another correction in bitcoin prices before the end of the year. However, he also maintained his own bullish USD 25,000 bitcoin price prediction for the end of 2018, and a whopping USD 500,000 for the end of 2024. Speaking of bitcoin, Yusko said “it will have a parabolic move and then a crash, then a parabolic move and a crash, and that's the way technology is adopted.” #Bitcoin is #JustGettingWarmedUp$25,000 end of 2018$75,000 end of 2020$200,000 end of 2022$500,000 end of 2024 https://t.co/3ZarEFIRxH Bitcoin was up roughly 45% from the lows of late June, but has now pulled back to a level about 35% higher than those lows. The rally has been fueled partly by speculation that a bitcoin-backed exchange traded fund (ETF) will be approved later this year in the US."
1," Crypto investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twins best-known for their conflict with Mark Zuckerberg during Facebook’s early years, for the second time had an application for a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF) rejected by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin dipped below the USD 8,000-mark on Thursday evening following the news, in what can best be described as a healthy pullback following the strong surge in prices on Monday and Tuesday. Bitcoin price chart: On Thursday, the proposal filed through BATS BZX Exchange to list the “Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust” was voted down 3 to 1 by the SEC. The rejection marks the second time the Winklevoss twins have had a proposal for a bitcoin-backed ETF disapproved by the SEC. In response to the regulator’s concerns from earlier, the twins this time argued that bitcoin markets in general, including their own Gemini Exchange, are “uniquely resistant to manipulation.” The SEC listed in its decision “protection of investors and the public interest,” as well as insufficient “means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices” as key reasons for its conclusion. However, the commission also noted that the disapproval is not based on an evaluation of whether bitcoin “has utility or value” as an investment or not. In a statement, commissioner Hester M. Peirce, who voted against the decision to block the ETF, said: “More institutional participation would ameliorate many of the Commission’s concerns with the bitcoin market that underlie its disapproval order,” she said, adding that the ruling “sends a strong signal that innovation is unwelcome in our markets.” Despite this week’s disapproval, the ETF application with perhaps the best odds of receiving an approval is still under consideration by the SEC. That proposal, filed by financial firm VanEck through the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) – one of two futures exchanges where bitcoin is traded – is “nearly certain” to receive an approval, according to an anonymous former SEC employee. However, the recent bitcoin rally may turn out to do more harm than good for the prospects of getting an ETF approved by the SEC this year, another report suggested. An ETF would allow the average Joe to buy and sell bitcoin without having to go through an exchange – something that, as everyone hopes, would significantly improve adoption."
1," Cryptocurrency investment firm Pantera Capital reported a more than 10,000 percent lifetime return on Friday, coming five years after its formation. In an email, co-chief investment officers Dan Morehead (who is also CEO) and Joey Krug shared the figure as they celebrated the fund’s fifth anniversary. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they’re still bullish about bitcoin, particularly in the years since Pantera’s launch, noting that “the Fund’s lifetime return is 10,136.15% net of fees and expenses.” To that end, Morehead and Krug included two emails that the fund sent out in 2013 to illustrate that point. “We wanted to share the original logic – as it is equally compelling today,” Morehead and Krug wrote. At the time, an email sent by Morehead predicted that bitcoin – which was trading at $104 at the time – would see $5,000 because “bitcoin dominates cash, electronic fiat money, gold, bearer bonds, large stone discs, etc. It can do all of the things that each of those can. It’s the first global currency since gold. It’s the first borderless payment system ever.” Three months later, bitcoin was trading at $253 when Morehead again touted the principles behind the cryptocurrency. Morehead wrote at the time: “In my opinion, it’s like deciding whether to buy Microsoft back in the day at $0.20 a share. It was hard to do when the stock was just at $0.10. In the fullness of time…clearly a great trade. I believe bitcoin right now is just like that. The world’s first global currency since gold and the world’s only borderless payments system (frictionless to boot) at a market cap of $3bn? Now that Silk Road is gone, a new wave of sophisticated investors are entering.” Pantera, which has since launched its own hedge fund to invest in blockchain startups, plans to travel “over the next months to discuss Venture Fund III and the blockchain disruption.” “We have organized group lunches in many cities, should you want to meet other investors who share your interest in blockchain,” the officers wrote. Some of the firm’s recent investments include sharing economy startup Origin and “stablecoin” startup Basis. Bitcoins image via Shutterstock"
1," Bitcoin’s (BTC) drop below $8,000 yesterday may have tempered the positive mood in the market, but the broader outlook still remains bullish, technical charts indicate. The overnight drop in price came soon after the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) second rejection of the Winklevoss brothers’ application for a bitcoin ETF. While the decision may have soured the sentiment in the market, the price pullback was also likely a function of overbought conditions. Notably, the short-duration price chart had warned of a dip below $8,000 yesterday. At press time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading at $7,965 on Bitfinex, having clocked a three-day low of $7,848 earlier today. It is worth noting that BTC is still up 40 percent from the June 24 low of $5,755, despite the pullback from the two-month highs above $8,500. Thus, it is safe to say the bull market is intact.  The bearish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) seen in the above chart may have helped trigger a correction in prices. The drop saw the cryptocurrency beaching the rising channel yesterday, neutralizing the immediate bullish outlook and also establishing a lower highs and lower lows pattern (bearish setup). That said, the path of least resistance remains to the upside as the 50-candle, 100-candle, and 200-candle moving averages (MAs) are rising and located one above the other. The pullback has also allowed the RSI to position itself in a more bull-positive way, meaning it is no longer reporting overbought conditions.  Investors may feel tempted to question the validity of the long-term bullish breakout discussed yesterday as BTC has fallen back into a descending channel. However, asset prices tend to revisit key support levels (former resistance levels) immediately after a long-term bullish breakout due to overbought conditions. This is widely referred to as a “crowding out of weak hands” (that is, bulls with low-risk appetite) before a bigger rally. Hence, a long-term bullish breakout remains on the cards and would be confirmed if BTC makes a weekly close (as per UTC) above $8,050 (falling channel resistance) on Sunday. Meanwhile, BTC retains a short-term bullish outlook, as the 5-day and 10-day MAs continue to rise in favor of the bulls. What’s more, BTC is also trading well above the 50-day MA and 100-day MA hurdle. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

0," Bitcoin price chart: Bitcoin faced heavy offers near the USD 8,500 level, resulting in a tiny bearish reaction. BTC/USD declined below the USD 8,400 support and is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) consolidating near the USD 8,250 support. Conversely, there was a decent upward move in a few altcoins like ethereum, stellar, IOTA, EOS and XRP. Going forward, if bitcoin price resumes it uptrend, it would be interesting to see whether altcoins decline or continue to recover. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price corrected lower and moved below the USD 8,400 and USD 8,250 support levels. However, BTC/USD found a decent support near USD 8,100 and it is currently trading flat near the USD 8,250 level.
On the upside, an initial resistance is near USD 8,350, above which, the price must clear the USD 8,400 and USD 8,500 resistances to gain bullish momentum. On the downside, supports are seen near USD 8,200 and USD 8,100. Ethereum
Ethereum price recovered further and broke the USD 475 resistance. ETH/USD is currently trading up by roughly 1.6% to USD 482. A break above the USD 485 and USD 490 levels could clear the path for a break above USD 500 in the near term.
On the downside, there are many supports, starting with USD 470. However, there is a key support and buy zone forming near the USD 465 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price extended its consolidation phase and remained confined in a range above the USD 850 support. BCH/USD must break the USD 870 resistance to accelerate gains towards the USD 900 level in the near term. Supports are at USD 840 and USD 820.
Ripple price is slowly moving higher and is currently trading above the USD 0.460 level. XRP/USD is facing a crucial resistance near the USD 0.470 level, above which, it could surpass USD 0.485. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, many altcoins moved into the green zone. A few cryptocurrencies performed really well, including stratis, stellar and holo, up by 14%, 9% and 8% respectively. Moreover, komodo, PPT, PIVX, MANA and dropil also posted gains more than 5%. Overall, bitcoin price is currently in a correction phase, which may perhaps help altcoins in the short term. However, once BTC/USD starts moving higher, altcoins could decline once again. On the flip side, if both bitcoin and altcoins move higher, buyers will most likely gain bullish momentum."
0," With bitcoin futures contracts traded on CME Group’s exchange set to expire on Friday July 27, some traders may be wondering what to expect from the event. The expiry date on a futures contract is the day when the contract is settled. In the traditional commodities markets, for instance the market for sugar, this means that the trader holding the futures contract on this day better get ready to take physical delivery of 112,000 pounds of sugar – the standard contract size in this market. Some other futures markets, including bitcoin, instead settles the contract in cash on the expiry date, leaving the holder of that contract to do whatever he wants with the cash he receives.  In the past, the underlying markets for bitcoin have seen strong volatility and often some degree of selling following futures contracts expiry dates. This is a phenomenon known from both the stock market and foreign currencies, as large players in the market act to adjust their risk and holdings following the expiry. While generally a positive for the adoption of bitcoin as a mainstream investment asset, futures contracts have opened up the possibility for large investors to easily short bitcoin, meaning that they can profit from bitcoin moving lower in price. This has led some to claim that the futures market is negatively affecting bitcoin prices. Despite this, it is a reality that all markets consist of both bull and bears, and both sides are needed for the market to reflect true prices and be a place where buyers and sellers can meet and easily transact with each other. Bitcoin futures sees increased interest According to CME Group, interest in bitcoin futures trading is soaring, with trading volume up 93% in the second quarter of this year. Given the fact that mostly financial institutions and very big traders are active in the futures market, this points to a strong increase in institutional interest in bitcoin over the past few months. Bitcoin futures average daily volume in Q2 grew 93% over previous quarter, while open interest surpassed 2,400 contracts, a 58% increase. Learn more about trading #Bitcoin futures: https://t.co/adjWVWXBPQ pic.twitter.com/UQWC3nGGrI Back in June, Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, also blamed expiring futures contracts for the weakness seen in bitcoin at the time. Bitcoin had then just plunged from close to USD 7,700 to USD 6,300 over the course of 4 days.  However, the market later recovered, witnessing a jump up from a low of USD 5,800 on June 28 to around USD 8,200 at the time of writing."
0," Bitcoin miners sold off more coins than they mined over the past 24 hours, thus converting part of their holdings to cash, according to blockchain analytics providers, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. Miners historically have held a significant portion of their earnings in bitcoin in anticipation of future appreciation. This time, however, some observers believe miners are preparing for yet another downturn in bitcoin prices.  While observers disagree about the reasons behind the selling, some point out that miners likely can’t afford not to sell, given the unprofitability many of them have seen in their business over the past few months. ”I’d expect that at these relatively low price levels, miners are selling off all of their new takings - they can’t afford not to,” Nic Carter, co-founder of Coinmetrics, an open source analytics provider in the crypto space, told Bloomberg. According to an estimate from Bloomberg, most bitcoin miners need prices of around USD 8,000 to break-even in their business. Bitcoin broke through that level on Tuesday, after having traded in unprofitable territory since May. Bitcoin price chart: ____

0," Bitcoin’s (BTC) 45 percent month-on-month rally has likely put the leading cryptocurrency on the path to a long-term bull market, technical studies indicate. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,300 on Bitfinex, having clocked a two-month high of $8,507 on Tuesday. A month ago, it was all gloom and doom in the bitcoin market, as the cryptocurrency had created back-to-back long-term bearish chart patterns in the months of May and June. Consequently, BTC looked primed for a move lower to $5,000. However, the inverse head-and-shoulders breakout seen earlier this month confirmed a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change. Furthermore, the convincing break above $8,000 seen this week appears to have set the stage for a major bull run.  To start with, the pennant breakdown witnessed on June 9 had signaled a revival of the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017. However, the ensuing sell-off ran out of steam at $5,755 (June 24 low) and the subsequent recovery established a falling channel (bearish pattern marked by circles), which has been breached to the higher side this week. So, what we have is an upside break of the four-month-long falling channel, i.e. a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  The short-term outlook also remains bullish as indicated by the rising channel (higher highs and higher lows). Still, there is merit in being cautious as the above chart also shows a bearish relative strength index (RSI) divergence, which could yield a price pullback.

0," At the time of writing, the price of bitcoin sits at USD 8,254.49. That represents roughly a 42% jump, compared to some USD 5,800 where it sat a month ago. If you had bought bitcoin for 100 USD on June 25, 2018, that money would now be worth approximately 142 USD. Is it time to start kicking yourself because you didn't buy the dip? Nobody knows, this might as well be one of the final spasms before bitcoin kicks the bucket. Or, it might be the return to December glory, USD 20,000 and beyond. Whatever the case may be, it didn't take long for the media, and the crypto community, to take notice of the surge and act accordingly. The media are 'bullish', and pretty much everyone and their cats reported on the price jump.  The crypto public switched, almost immediately, from dark memes to WHEN MOON, WHEN LAMBO.   pic.twitter.com/k3cVRw6g63 The total Market capitalization is reaching 300 billion USD, and currently sits at 298.6bn (UTC 09:10 AM), according to Coinmarketcap.com. Trade volume, in the past 24 hours, jumped to 20bn USD, a figure it last saw on July 18. Meanwhile, BitMEX, a major crypto exchange, claims it has broken the industry record for bitcoin trading volume, with more than 1 million bitcoin traded on the platform in 24 hours for the period closing July 24, 2018. Also, bitcoin's dominance is growing, too: Percentage of total market capitalization (dominance): We can speculate all day as to what prompted this surge in price, but it's probably a little bit of everything. For example, Bitcoin ETF is making rounds in the media. While news from Facebook and Google are not likely to move the market, it still might help investor sentiment.   Meanwhile, Matthew Newton, analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, suggested on Tuesday that ""if bitcoin can close above USD 8,000 today, we could assume that we may have a good run toward USD 10,000.”  It's Wednesday and bitcoin is still above USD 8,000. “The short squeeze on the market that occurred after the pattern completed, caused some concern that we were seeing a repeat of what happened in April, when bitcoin failed to break USD 10,000. By soaring past those key barriers of resistance, it would seem history is not repeating itself and there’s real strength in the move,” he said.  In either case, remember these 10 dangerous traps for crypto traders, including FOMO (fear of missing out), before deciding your next move in the crypto market."
0," Bitcoin price chart: Bitcoin price extended gains once it settled above the USD 8,000 resistance. BTC/USD traded above the USD 8,250 resistance and even broke the USD 8,400 hurdle. It traded near USD 8,490 and is currently correcting lower. More importantly, there was an upward move in most major altcoins like ethereum, ripple, BCH, litecoin, IOTA and EOS. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price remained in a bullish trend and broke the USD 8,400 barrier. BTC/USD is currently correcting lower (UTC 08:30 AM), but dips remain well supported on the downside. An initial support is at USD 8,250, below which, the price could test the USD 8,100 level.
On the upside, it won’t be easy for buyers to surpass the USD 8,480 - USD 8,500 resistance area. Above this, the price will most likely start a fresh rally toward the USD 9,000 level. Ethereum
Ethereum price finally gained buyers and recovered above the USD 475 resistance. ETH/USD traded above the USD 485 level before retreating to USD 475. 
The pair is showing a few positive signs, but it must gain strength to retain upsides above the USD 480 and USD 500 resistance levels. Supports on the downside are at USD 470 and USD 460. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price extended gains above the USD 850 level. It traded towards the USD 875 level before retreating back to USD 850. An initial support on the downside is at USD 840, followed by USD 830. On the upside, a break above the USD 860 level could push the price towards USD 880 and USD 900.
Ripple price is showing a few signs of life above the USD 0.450 level. However, XRP/USD seems to be struggling to move past the USD 0.470 resistance, which is a major barrier for more gains. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins rallied recently like IOST, pundi x, zencash, polymath, ardor, ELF, LOOM and binance coin. Out of these, IOST and pundi x gained 34% and 20% respectively. To sum up, upsides in bitcoin were impressive, but technical indicators are signaling a short-term downward correction. However, dips remain attractive to buyers near the USD 8,250 and USD 8,100 levels. Once a correction phase is complete, BTC/USD will most likely resume its upside towards USD 8,500 and USD 8,800."
0," The recent bitcoin rally may turn out to do more harm than good for the prospects of getting a bitcoin-backed exchange traded fund (ETF) approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this year, a new report suggested. With the bitcoin market soaring again, some worry that the SEC will be hesitant to add fuel to the fire. “The SEC doesn’t want any part of adding to or influencing some speculative bubble,” said Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. He claims he’s now  “10 times more pessimistic” about a fund being approved.  In a letter from the SEC in January, valuation and volatility were cited as key concerns for the regulator regarding a bitcoin ETF. That letter, however, was written in the aftermath of the explosive growth that brought bitcoin to levels close to USD 20,000, a far cry from the situation in the market today. As reported by Cryptonews.com, in the letter, written by the SEC’s director Dalia Blass, the commission remained concerned over the funds which offer cryptocurrency related products rather than cryptocurrencies, where the risk of volatility would increase from the influence of underlying markets. A few other points mentioned in the letter:  The ETF application that bitcoin investors are most optimistic about was filed in June by New York-based VanEck through the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) – a company that certainly has a name for itself as being a heavyweight in the world of finance. However, Jake Chervinsky, a US-based lawyer at Kobre & Kim, a law firm, suggested that due to rulemaking procedures the SEC can, and probably will, delay its decision on the VanEck/SolidX commodity-backed bitcoin ETF until February 21, 2019. 0/ It kills me to tweet about SEC rulemaking procedures, but given the confusion on #crypto twitter today, it feels necessary.TL;DR -- the SEC can, and probably will, delay its decision on the VanEck/SolidX commodity-backed #bitcoin ETF until ~February 21, 2019.Thread. Bitcoin is currently up more than 40% since the lows in late June, partly driven by speculation that a bitcoin ETF would get approved in the US this year. An ETF is seen as an important step on the way to facilitate the mainstream adoption of bitcoin as an investment asset, much in the same way as futures contracts helped legitimize bitcoin as a trading asset last year. Meanwhile, the cryptoverse is growing restless, trying to persuade the SEC to approve a bitcoin ETF."
0," Bitcoin traders may have their eyes on a different kind of chart this week. That’s because Friday, July 27 is the date that bitcoin futures contracts offered by derivatives giant CME Group are scheduled to expire. A financial product that lets institutions and professional traders long or short the crypto asset (betting on its future performance), history shows the price of bitcoin drops 7.89 percent on average in the five days prior to a contract expiration. As such, data suggests the event could trigger a healthy pullback in prices for the cryptocurrency. Still, other factors may be at play this time around. Investor interest in the bitcoin futures market is seeing substantial growth – perhaps best depicted by a tweet from the CME Group which stated that their bitcoin futures product was up 93 percent in volume and 58 percent in open interest in Q2. CME futures continued their growth into Q3 including a record volume of contracts set this past Tuesday, equivalent to 64,390 bitcoins with a notional value of $530 million, according to another tweet from the CME Group. While the numbers are encouraging for widespread adoption of bitcoin investment, many have argued bitcoin futures negatively impact price. Prior to the introduction of bitcoin futures, there were few options for traditional investors to short the market, and this particular investment type has accomplished just that, allowing bears to speculate alongside the bulls. Again interest to what’s ahead is that the price of bitcoin has been on the rebound over the last few weeks where at press time, bitcoin is trading at $8,182 – printing a 41 percent increase from its annual low ($5,799) set less than a month ago, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. That said, the dramatic growth has led to overextended technical charts, including the highest daily RSI level since December, which could be a factor in helping history repeat.  As seen in the chart above, the price of bitcoin recorded a loss in the five days leading up to the expiry on four out of the six occasions where futures have expired. Most notably, in the days prior to the close of the January and March contracts, price fell 13.05 and 20.45 percent respectively (closing price on expiry day subtracted from opening price of fifth day prior). The average performance of the four negative occasions comes out to a depreciation of 12.82 percent while the remaining two occasions recorded a meager average gain of 1.69 percent.  Perhaps not coincidentally, Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $19,891 (on Bitfinex) on Dec. 17, 2017, the exact day CME introduced their first bitcoin futures product. Price has been on a steady decline ever since and figures currently reflect a 58 percent depreciation from the high mark. While it should not come as a surprise for prices to drop in a bear market, it will be interesting to see how future’s impact the price of bitcoin, if at all, if the cryptocurrency returns to its bullish glory.

0," Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has seen a $350 drop this morning from Tuesday’s two-month highs and may be headed for a short-term correction, technical charts suggest. As of writing, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $8,220 on Bitfinex down 3.5 percent from the high of $8,507 reached yesterday. Today’s dip is not surprising and could be extended further as BTC’s 40 percent rally from the seven-month low of $5,755 reached on June 24 is still looking overstretched, as per the relative strength index (RSI). The short duration charts have also aligned in favor of a deeper correction. However, the bullish reversal has likely revved up investor interest and bargain hunters who missed out on lower prices prior to the rally could step in prevent significant losses.  The 50-hour, 100-hour, and 200-hour moving averages (MAs) are trending north and are located one above the other, indicating the path of least resistance is to the upside. Consequently, these MAs could be the area of interest of the bargain hunter. As of writing, the 50-hour MA is located at $8,023. Meanwhile, the 100-hour MA, currently located at $7,736, almost coincides with the rising trendline, thus dip demand could be strong around that level.  The rising (bullish) 5-day MA and 10-day MA are located at $7,830 and $7,538, respectively. The 100-day MA, which acted as a stiff resistance last week, is seen offering strong support at $7,612. Clearly, the area between the $7,830 and $7,530 is packed with key moving average lines and could act as a strong support zone.

1," Bitcoin (BTC) price has climbed above the $8,100 mark for the first time today since mid-May. Bitcoin’s bull run this week is leading many to predict a return of its 2017 bull run that pushed BTC to almost $20,000. July 16th seems to have started this run when BlackRock, the world’s largest exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider, announced that its company had assembled a group to look into cryptocurrencies, more specifically, Bitcoin (BTC). This news immediately boosted BTC into the green with 4% gains. BlackRock, to date, has managed nearly $6.4 trillion in assets. News of potential institutional investors dipping their toes into the market has given cryptocurrencies a boost in the past. With the world’s largest ETF provider eyeing cryptocurrencies, it seems investors have gained more confidence in crypto. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still mulling over whether it will approve a Bitcoin ETF, which was first filed through the Chicago Board of Exchange (CBOE). If approved, a Bitcoin ETF would mean individuals would be able to buy Bitcoin without having to go through crypto exchanges, many of which have been having serious security issues and have been hacked (which may lead some people to be wary of using them). The ICO Journal reported late last week that it is highly likely that a Bitcoin ETF will be approved. “I would call [the likelihood of approval] 90% at this point. The crypto markets have moderated and regulators have watched the lack of drama surrounding bitcoin futures across several global exchanges,” one of the ICO Journal’s unnamed sources, from the CFTC, reportedly said. “The price moderation and adoption of a peer product is what the conversations have centered around. In January we were justifiably concerned about a bubble and the harm a quickly approved product could attract speculators and create losses that led to significant lawsuits. Now, those factors seem to be mitigated significantly.” However, new reports have surfaced that the SEC will be pushing back their decision until September. The Bitcoin (BTC) bull run has extended over ten days and doesn’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon. For the week, Bitcoin is up 20%. The largest cryptocurrency has also boosted the rest of the market, as mostly all coins in the top 25 are sitting in the green currently. Bitcoin’s dominance of the entire cryptocurrency market has just hit 47%, which hasn’t been reached since BTC skyrocketed to its all-time high price back in December 2017. A year ago, Bitcoin held a very similar percentage hold on the market at 47.9%. At press time, BTC is trading at $8,179 a coin, up 6.07% in 24 hours. For the week, BTC is up 20.86%, and for the month, the digital currency is up 39%. >> Bitcoin is Bullish but the G20’s Still Out on Regulation Featured Image: unsplash/© Bernard Hermant"
1," Everyone who is even remotely interested in cryptocurrencies, has its gaze fixed on the SEC (The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) in these past couple of days. For those of you who have been living under a rock lately, the date when the SEC gives its opinion on the proposed bitcoin ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is drawing closer.  An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, would allow the average Joe to buy and sell bitcoin without having to go through an exchange – something that, as everyone hopes, would significantly improve adoption.  The decision is estimated in the coming months, and it has prompted huge amounts of media attention and waves of internet memes. Google trends are showing that the general public's overall interest in the ETF has exploded, reaching highs it hasn't seen since late 2017. In the past, the SEC has turned down several ETF proposals. The cryptoverse hope that this time (a new proposal filed through the Chicago Board of Exchange (CBOE) by New York-based VanEck and blockchain platform SolidX) things might be different. The bitcoin ETF is ""nearly certain"" later this year, the ICO Journal reported, citing two undisclosed sources. One source is from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, while the second source is a former SEC employee who left the regulator two weeks ago. ""In January we were justifiably concerned about a bubble and the harm a quickly approved product could attract speculators and create losses that led to significant lawsuits. Now, those factors seem to be mitigated significantly,” according to the first source. While the second source expects a positive outcome in September, ""or if it gets strung out a little further it is simply a few ‘dotted i’s and crossed t’s’ are being finalized on larger regulatory language in the crypto space."" However, Bloomberg, for example, reports that we have bigger chances to land on Jupiter, than to see a bitcoin ETF launch in the US this year. According to the report, the SEC is tentative and slow, and it's just a matter of time before Canada steps in and scoops the pool. Bloomberg says the SEC asked the industry to withdraw original ETF requests, and sent out a letter to the fund industry, containing 31 questions about liquidity, valuation and security. It wants to have these answered before any new requests are filed.  ""Leveraged Bitcoin ETFs would almost certainly be the most volatile ETFs on the market and likely approved only after non-leveraged ones,"" it writes. ""Inverse ETFs would allow for the shorting of Bitcoin, without the risk of losing more than 100% of the investment."" At the same tame, the cryptoverse is growing restless.  This summer, the SEC asked the community for their comments about the Bitcoin ETF and it has received hundreds of replies.  A few examples below: Also, internet memes are mushrooming. While some are posting pictures of John F. Kennedy, clearly hinting at the moon, others are posting gifs of bitcoin killing altcoins, hinting at the recent price surge that does not seem to have affected the altcoins.

1," Bitcoin price chart: Bitcoin price remained in an uptrend and broke two important resistances at USD 7,800 and USD 8,000 (for the first time since May). BTC/USD traded towards the USD 8,050 level and is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) preparing for more gains. Conversely, many major altcoins struggled to recover, including ethereum, ripple, neo, litecoin, EOS and IOTA. “The short squeeze on the market that occurred after the pattern completed, caused some concern that we were seeing a repeat of what happened in April, when bitcoin failed to break USD 10,000. By soaring past those key barriers of resistance, it would seem history is not repeating itself and there’s real strength in the move. If bitcoin can close above USD 8,000 today, we could assume that we may have a good run toward USD 10,000,” Matthew Newton, analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, said in a daily market commentary.  Bitcoin
Bitcoin price rallied above the USD 8,000 to register more than 3% gains. The next resistance on the upside is at USD 8,180, above which, BTC/USD will most likely break the USD 8,250 level and trade towards the next hurdle at USD 8,400.
If the price corrects lower from the current levels, it may perhaps find support near USD 7,800, which was a resistance earlier. Below this, the next support and buy zone is near USD 7,650. Ethereum
Ethereum price remained in a bearish zone below the USD 475 resistance. However, ETH/USD buyers were able to defend losses near the USD 450 support.
The pair is currently trading near USD 470, but it must break the USD 475 resistance to start a decent recovery. The next resistance above USD 475 is at USD 490, followed by USD 500. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price remained supported near the USD 800 level. BCH/USD slowly moved higher and managed to break the USD 825 resistance. The next hurdle for buyers on the upside is near the USD 850-860 zone.
Ripple price is still in a negative zone and is trading below USD 0.460. XRP/USD must break the USD 0.460, USD 0.470 and USD 0.475 resistance levels to start a recovery in the near term. Supports are seen near USD 0.45 and USD 0.44. Other Altcoins Market Today
Most small cap altcoins traded in a range today and remained flat. However, holo and bitcoin private (BTCP) extended gains and moved up by more than 15%. BTCP is now facing a crucial hurdle on the upside near the USD 10.00 level.  Overall, bitcoin is climbing higher with many bullish signs. It seems like BTC/USD will most likely accelerate above the USD 8,150 level and test USD 8,400 in the coming sessions. More importantly, the market sentiment could boost once Ethereum surpasses the USD 475 resistance."
1," Bitcoin (BTC) has had a bullish start to the week, but the momentum could wane in the next few days, technical studies indicate. The leading cryptocurrency rose to a two-month high of $8,130 on Bitfinex today, having witnessed an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout last week. The 40 percent rally from the seven-month low of $5,755 reached on June 24 has put the bulls back in a commanding position. Hence, further gains could be on the cards, albeit after a brief pause or a price pullback as a key technical indicator is flashing overbought conditions. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $8,100 on Bitfinex.  Notably, the relative strength index (RSI), one of the most widely used momentum indicators, jumped above 70.00 (overbought zone) earlier today and is currently located at 74.56 – its highest level since December. So, it could be said that bitcoin is at its most overbought level in seven months. As a result, the cryptocurrency may find it hard to gain a foothold above the immediate resistance of $8,140 (pennant resistance) in the next few days and could see a minor price pullback. That said, a technical correction, if any, will likely be short-lived as the other tools are biased towards the bulls. For instance, the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are trending north, indicating a bullish setup. Meanwhile, the short duration charts are also calling a further price rally.  The broadening wedge breakout seen on the chart above indicates a continuation of the rally from the July 17 low of $6,740. Accordingly, the attention has now shifted to the significant price obstacle of the 200-day MA, currently located at $8,676.

1," Bitcoin’s price has climbed back above $8,000 for the first time in two months. According to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, the price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization jumped by $200 in just two hours on Wednesday and is changing hands at $8,015 as of press time – that’s a level not seen since May 24. The price of bitcoin had been declining since May 24 and reached a new year’s low at $5,785 on June 24, after which it started regaining momentum for a move back above $8,000, reflecting a nearly 40 percent increase since the June low. Data from Bitfinex shows the trading volume of bitcoin more than doubled amid the price move, having increased from $4.9 million to $12.6 million within just four hours on the exchange. That said, bitcoin is still down nearly 53 percent from the yearly high above $17,000 seen in January. Meanwhile, data shows that bitcoin’s market capitalization dominance has also increased significantly over the past two months. According to CoinMarketCap, bitcoin accounted for 37 percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization in mid-May. Yet that data has increased to 47 percent as of press time, pushing bitcoin’s dominance to a level not seen since late December. Notably, bitcoin is the only top 10 cryptocurrency by market cap that has seen growth over the past 24 hours, with other major cryptos all seeing declines of 1–5 percent, respectively.

1," This past week, there were decent gains in bitcoin. BTC/USD formed a solid support above the USD 7,200 level and remained in an uptrend. Recently, it broke a major resistance near USD 7,600 and the 100-day simple moving average, opening the doors for more gains. The next targets for buyers could be USD 8,000, USD 8,240 and USD 8,400 in the coming days. On the other hand, major altcoins like ethereum and ripple struggled to move higher and are currently trading near key resistance levels. Bitcoin price chart: ______
Total market capitalization (excluding Bitcoin): Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is gaining bullish momentum and it recently spiked above the USD 7,750 level. BTC/USD is now positioned well in a bullish zone and it will most likely accelerate gains towards USD 8,000 and USD 8,400. Above this last, the next major weekly resistance is at USD 8,800.
On the other hand, if the price corrects lower, it could find support near USD 7,600 and USD 7,500. Below this last, the next key weekly support is at USD 7,200. Ethereum
Ethereum declined this past week below the USD 485 and USD 470 support levels. ETH/USD even traded below the USD 450 support before stating a recovery.
However, the price is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) facing a tough resistance near USD 465 - USD 470. A break above this is required for a move towards USD 500. The next hurdle for buyers above USD 500 is at USD 515. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash performed better than ethereum and ripple. BCH/USD is currently trading up by more than 3% and is placed nicely above the USD 800 level. On the upside, weekly resistances are at USD 850 and 900. Supports on the downside are at USD 800, USD 785 and USD 750.
Ripple price settled below the USD 0.500 and USD 0.475 support levels. XRP/USD is currently trading in a range and is likely preparing for the next move either above USD 0.475 or below USD 0.460. Other Altcoins Market Today
Recently, many small cap altcoins performed well, including holo, bitcoin diamond, augur, dropil, nuls, MITH, VERI, KIN and digibyte. Out of these, holo and bitcoin diamond were the best performers with 34% and 30% gains respectively. Overall, the market sentiment improved lately and bitcoin price charts are showing many positive signs. A successful close above USD 8,000 could accelerate gains towards USD 8,400 or even 8,800 during this week."
1," Bitcoin’s (BTC) price clocked a two-month high of $7,820 today and looks set to extend gains further, a key cryptomarket gauge indicates. CoinMarketCap’s bitcoin dominance rate, an indicator that tracks the percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization contributed by the leading cryptocurrency, rose to 46 percent today — the highest level since December 20 — adding credence to BTC’s 20 percent rally seen in the last seven days. To start with, a rise in the BTC dominance rate essentially means the number one cryptocurrency is more in demand compared to the alternative cryptocurrencies.  The above chart shows: The fact that the BTC price rally from the seven-month lows below $6,000 is accompanied by the sharp rise in the dominance rate indicates the bargain hunters are likely betting on further sustainable gains in BTC prices and are not buying BTC to venture into alternative cryptocurrencies. In the latter case, the dominance rate of alternative cryptocurrencies over bitcoin rises sharply. This usually happens when BTC valuations start looking overstretched and in response investors begin rotating money into other innovations (as happened in late December 2017/early January). So, a sharp rise in the BTC dominance rate, as seen in the last four weeks, could be considered a sign of investor confidence in the current BTC price rally. Hence, BTC could soon find acceptance above the key 100-day moving average (MA) hurdle and cross the $8,000 mark in a convincing manner. At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,700 on Bitfinex — up 3.4 percent on a 24-hour basis.  The rally post-inverse head-and-shoulders breakout ran out of steam around the 100-day MA in the last five days, establishing the MA as a key technical resistance. A daily close (as per UTC) above the 100-day MA of $7,610 would further strengthen the bull grip and open the doors to 200-day MA, currently lined up at $8,720.  BTC is stuck in a broadening wedge — a continuation pattern, meaning an upside break would revive the rally from the July 17 low of $6,740 and open up upside towards the next major resistance located at $8,720 (200-day MA hurdle). The 50-candle, 100-candle, and 200-candle MAs are trending north and positioned one above the other in favor of the bulls. So, BTC is more likely to witness an upside breakout. That said, the bears could make a strong comeback if the broadening wedge is breached to the downside. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

1," You may have heard of a lagging or leading indicator before. Maybe your friends have tossed around terms like bullish or bearish divergences, oversold or overbought conditions and what signals you should use to enter or exit the market. While there are many tools that can assist with this, one often overlooked indicator is called the stochastic oscillator. Nothing unique to the world of blockchain, the stochastic is a momentum indicator that compares the closing price of the asset with its high-low range over a certain period of time, it’s a handy tool. Even better, it works no matter the volatility, even in the fast-moving market for cryptocurrencies. First, the particulars require a bit of math: Slow %K= 100 [Sum of the (C – L14) for the %K Slowing Period / Sum of the (H14 – L14) for the %K Slowing Period] Slow %D = SMA of Slow %K Where: Fortunately, crypto traders need not worry about the calculation part, as the trading platforms and chart softwares process the complex formula and produce a stochastic oscillator, as seen in the chart below. All you need to know is how to use the oscillator to maximize your efforts. To start with, the indicator can range from 0 to 100. The area above 80 represents overbought conditions, and the area below 20 indicates oversold conditions. So, price rallies usually stall after the stochastic reaches an overbought zone. On the other hand, stochastics reporting oversold conditions are widely considered a sign the bears have reached a point of exhaustion. Further, trend reversal signal occurs when the %K line and the %D line cross in the overbought (above 80.00) or oversold (below 20.00) region.  The above chart shows, bitcoin dropped 11% after the stochastic generated a sell signal on June 9. Further, it rallied more than 8 percent after the stochastic charted a buy signal on June 29 (green arrow). Note that stochastic tends to work best in broad trading ranges or slow-moving trends. Still, the stochastic is one tool of many. The difference between a leading indicator such as the stochastic or Relative Strength Index (RSI) and a lagging indicator such as Moving Averages or Bollinger Bands is that the leading indicators precede price movements, while lagging indicators follow price movements. Their usage also differs during trending and non-trending periods because lagging indicators tend to focus more on the trend and produce fewer buy and sell signals than their leading counterparts.

1," The chives growing in one crypto tycoon’s California mansion carry a hidden message. Guo Hongcai, a beef salesman turned early bitcoin adopter from China’s Shanxi province, is one of many freshly minted millionaires funneling parts of their wealth out of the country by purchasing real estate abroad. In April, Hongcai sold 500 bitcoin in the U.S. then used that money to buy a 100,000-square-foot mansion in Los Gatos, a 90-minute drive from San Francisco, California. His Rolls-Royce, also purchased with the fruits of bitcoin arbitrage, sits in the driveway close to a small chives garden. “It’s very normal to sell bitcoin in the U.S. After selling bitcoin, you can just buy anything you want,” he told CoinDesk. Guo calls this secondary residence his “Mansion of Chives,” because the vegetable is also Chinese slang for crypto investors who prove vulnerable to big sell-offs. As Chinese regulators clamp down on industry business on the mainland, crypto millionaires are turning to foreign real estate markets to diversify their holdings. Some purchase property directly with crypto, others like Hongcai use bitcoin to gain foreign currencies without going through a bank. The founders of the U.S. crypto real estate startup Slice told CoinDesk roughly one-third of their prospective users hail from Asia, figures which include Chinese investors seeking tokenized property rights through Hong Kong securities brokers. According to the South China Morning Post, real estate purchased in Hong Kong doesn’t require the same taxes and documentation as other financial assets held abroad. Chinese investment in foreign real estate, often through Hong Kong brokers, has been rising for years. Now early bitcoin adopters are utilizing new wealth for familiar patterns. “The requests we have from them start at $50,000 or $100,000 up to, the latest one was $3 to $4 million for Silicon Valley,” Natalia Karayaneva, CEO of Propy, another crypto-powered real estate marketplace, told CoinDesk. She added: “We’re seeing that more and more people are willing to buy properties with cryptocurrencies because it’s getting easier to get their money out of the country using bitcoin, rather than establishing a bank account based in Hong Kong and getting their money out of the country using business channels.” According to Karayaneva, the U.S. and the U.K. are the most sought-after locations for real estate, especially fintech hubs like London or California’s Bay Area. “They were mostly interested in residential properties next to good education, like Stanford,” she said. “Also, they want to diversify. They want to have parts of their assets abroad in more stable countries.” So far, around half of the traffic to Propy’s website comes from China, out of 50,000 monthly views. It’s a trend that has implications far beyond China, though, especially in California, where, according to statistics gathered over a decade by ATTOM Data Solutions, nearly a quarter of all single-family homes are now purchased in all-cash transactions without a mortgage. According to CEO Roy Dekel at SetSchedule, a California-based startup helping licensed real estate agents connect with buyers and homeowners, it’s more common for Chinese bitcoin veterans to convert cryptocurrency into cash than to buy property directly with it. “We have noticed a drop in Chinese interest, but certain cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York remain strong,” he told CoinDesk. “The ultra-wealthy Chinese have used this source as a diversification of investment.” On the other hand, Dekel also noticed “many blockchain enthusiasts” are buying second homes or investment properties, leading to an uptick in sellers interested in accepting cryptocurrencies directly from international buyers. Since platforms like Propy are compliant across jurisdictions, the reason behind this trend may go beyond tax evasion, speaking to real pain points in legitimate markets. In January, The New York Times asserted that China’s exorbitant housing market is “like a casino.” Further, Reuters reported property development restrictions continue to tighten, such as reduced subsidies for housing developers. “In Beijing, only last year they saw a 40 percent rise in price,” Karayaneva said. “Historically, real estate investors from China are very active abroad because their own property market is going crazy.” All things considered, Chinese buyers are hardly the only ones purchasing property with cryptocurrency. In 2017, Europeans used bitcoin to buy luxury apartments in Dubai’s Aston Crypto Plaza, a project spearheaded by British Baroness Michelle Mone. Wherever it’s taking place, though, it has become increasingly clear that crypto wealth could have a real impact on global real estate patterns. Door image via Shutterstock"
1," When it comes to making big money in trading, the trend is your friend. But spotting the trend when it is in the nascent stage is challenging, and running along with it right up to the top is an even bigger challenge. That’s because asset prices rarely see a 90-degree rally or collapse. More often than not, trends (bullish/bearish) will pause briefly to allow traders or investors who missed the initial move (higher or lower) to join the bandwagon. If the participation increases, the asset price extends the bull or bear run, or else a trend reversal may occur. A trader can spot trend extensions with the help of bullish or bearish continuation patterns, which occur in a variety of easily identifiable shapes, some of the most popular of which are known as bull and bear flags. A bull flag is appropriately spotted in an uptrend when the price is likely to continue upward, while the bear flag is conversely spotted in a downtrend when the price is likely to sink further. (While the implication of the pattern is far more important than its name, the “flag” terminology derives from its visual similarity to the fabric you’d see hanging outside a government building.)  Each flag pattern consists of two main components: the pole and flag. The “pole” represents a strong impulsive move (higher/lower) and is backed by a surge in trading volume and the subsequent pause or consolidation the “flag,” which looks like a falling or rising channel. The flag pattern can be invaluable for a trader in that there are clear points of success and failure to profit or mitigate risk from. If resistance breaks in a bull flag, the trader can be confident price will continue upwards roughly the length of the pole (popularly known as measured height method). If support of the bull flag is breached, the trader knows the pattern is invalid and continuation is unlikely. The exact opposite is the case for a bear flag. An asset usually mimics the pole after a bull flag breakout or bear flag breakdown. So, the target is derived as follows: The real world demonstrations of both flag types are depicted below. The Bull Flag  The cryptocurrency cleared the flag resistance on Feb. 20, 2017, signaling a continuation of the rally from the $917 low of the pole and opened upside towards $1,228 (target as per measured height method, i.e. pole height ($157) added to breakout price). Guess what, bitcoin came just $10 shy of price target on Feb. 24, 2017.  In this case, ether broke the flag support on Mar. 17, 2018 suggesting continued depreciation from the $699 pole high and set scope for $463 (target as per measured height method, i.e. pole height ($133) deduced from breakdown price). Surprise, surprise, ether was just $12 shy of reaching the exact price target on March 18, 2018. Bull flags and bear flags can be a trader’s friend in strongly trending markets, but they do not always perform as advertised. In some cases, the pattern can present a trap known as a “false breakout” when price breaches the boundary of the flag and quickly retraces. Waiting for a candlestick to close outside of the flag tends to add credence to the breakout, and can help the trader mitigate risk. As a trader, you would want to avoid betting or punting on an asset price if the bull flag breakout of bear flag breakout is not backed by strong volumes. A low volume move usually ends up trapping investors on the wrong side of the market. Further, using indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to gauge scope for a rally following a breakout can help boost traders’ success rates.

0," “Has Bitcoin bottomed yet?” seems to be a favorite question of those frantically trying to predict the price of the most popular cryptocurrency - perhaps all of us. It seems like no expert agrees - some say it has bottomed, others say it hasn’t, while there’s always that group that says Bitcoin has no intrinsic value at all, so the point is moot. As reported, Barry Silbert, CEO of Digital Currency Group, a venture capital company focusing on the digital currency market, says the market has bottomed out when it comes to Bitcoin.  When asked what caused the bottom to come in now, Silbert replied by saying “I think the bears just kind of ran out of energy, ran out of Bitcoin to sell, and I think that from a technical perspective it’s starting to look pretty good,” adding that “when the Chair of the Fed [The Federal Reserve System, the central banking system of the USA] says negative things about Bitcoin […] and Bitcoin doesn’t move, I think that’s a really bullish sign.” Meanwhile, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and co-CEO of Bitmex, a cryptocurrency exchange, and the Bitcoin bull who predicted the cryptocurrency would reach USD 50,000 by year’s end just a few weeks ago, said Bitcoin hasn’t bottomed yet. “I don't actually think we've seen the worst [...] I would like to see us test 5,000 to really see if we put a bottom in,” he told CNBC. Bitcoin price chart: In May, a popular crypto analyst, Willy Woo, estimated that there may possibly be a correction going into the July-September period, followed by an accumulation phase. Meanwhile, various experts recently forecasted that bitcoin might reach USD 25,000 - USD 60,000 by the end of this year. (Watch Tom Lee, co-founder and head of Fundstrat Global Advisors, commenting on the recent bitcoin's breakout here.) However, the forecast game of whether or not Bitcoin has finally hit rock bottom is a dangerous one. Around a month ago, experts on CNBC’s Fast Money believed that Bitcoin was bottoming out at USD 7,000. However, only a few days later, Bitcoin slumped below USD 7,000 and stayed there until a few days ago."
0," Despite a slump in Bitcoin trading volume of about 45% this year, one cryptocurrency-focused fund is crushing its own record in terms of capital inflow, raising almost USD 250 million during the first half of 2018. Grayscale Cumulative Inflows by Investment Product
December 31, 2017 through June 30, 2018 In its first Digital Asset Investment report, Grayscale Investments, a fund under Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, said that Wall Street has moved quickly in adopting technologies related to crypto, and that the market for initial coin offerings (ICOs) has continued to grow despite the broader market sell-off this year. Grayscale Investment Product Performance
Total Return (Cumulative %) Grayscale Investments has USD 2 billion under management, and operates a range of funds focused on cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ripple, and ethereum. 63% of the capital inflow reportedly went to the company’s Bitcoin-focused fund. According to the report, 56% of the interest this year came from institutional investors such as banks and hedge funds, indicating that institutional money is taking a more prominent position in the cryptocurrency market. Grayscale Investor Profile by Type
December 31, 2017 through June 30, 2018 As reported, Barry Silbert is bullish on Bitcoin, telling CNBC that he believes the bears have “run out of Bitcoin to sell,” and that we have likely already seen the bottom in Bitcoin prices."
0," $8,000? It’s not out of the question. With no price pullback happening in the wake of Tuesday’s sudden surge, the technical charts indicate bitcoin could soon close in on this key psychological benchmark. First, an expected pullback was not without merit (the charts were looking overextended on Tuesday when the 4-hour RSI reached its highest level since 2016), but since Wednesday, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has largely consolidated gains in a narrow range between $7,246 and $7,588. As the trading range tightens and the technical indicators regain composure, the probability of bullish continuation increases. At press time, the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index shows bitcoin is changing hands at $$7484.06 up 0.18 percent on a 24-hour basis.  Bitcoin (BTC) has been in a clear consolidation mode since the conclusion of Tuesday’s rally, but the daily bias remains bullish. Price is sitting comfortably above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline ($7,838) and three of the four important exponential moving averages (EMAs) are trending positively – maintaining the bullish view. The 12-day and 50-day EMAs are nearing a bullish cross while the 100-day EMA is beginning to curve upward, which implies a bullish setup. What’s more, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), an indicator used to measure buy and sell pressure, is still printing levels in bullish favor. A bullish rally will not be an easy feat however since heavy resistance lies in the $7,600-$7,800 range. The resistance zone includes four strong technical hurdles: Another reason for bulls to proceed with caution is the RSI approaching overbought conditions. While the RSI (currently 68) is capable of reaching much higher levels (it hit 93 in December 2017), a level of just 70 halted the previous substantial bullish rally in April. The hourly chart paints a clearer picture of the post-rally consolidation taking place. What started as choppy hourly consolidation morphed into a pennant-like structure, composed of a “higher-low, lower-high pattern.” The pennant formation (continuation pattern) supplemented by price sitting above all four hourly EMAs and the 0.382 Fibonacci Retracement (from May high), as well as the hourly RSI beginning to trend upwards, creates a rather clear short-term bullish bias. As the trading range continues to narrow, the closer BTC is to a breakout. A bullish rally would first likely test the larger pennant resistance (blue line) followed by the upper boundary of the resistance zone mentioned in the daily chart, $7874 (0.5 retracement).

1," The world’s richest of the rich are often asked about their opinions on current matters, especially if it pertains to the financial sector. Their opinions on Bitcoin vary wildly, from contemptuous dismissal to bullishness akin to that of Tim Draper. This time, Ken Griffin, Marc Lasry and Howard Marks offer their view of the cryptocurrency. One of them even claims that he has invested 1% of his personal funds into Bitcoin. Ken Griffin, American investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist, is not a fan of Bitcoin, to say the least. He still scratches his head about it, he said at the Delivering Alpha Conference in New York on Wednesday, adding, according to CNBC, “I have a hard time finding myself wanting to be in the position of being a liquidity provider to a product that I don’t believe in.” He also said, “I don’t have a single portfolio manager [of mine] who has told me we should buy crypto, not a single portfolio manager.”  Interesting, because reports say that the investment banking giant Goldman Sachs, is looking to add cryptocurrency trading. At the same time, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, said on Monday that the world’s largest asset manager has put together a team to look at blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. However, Fink argues that he does not see massive investor demand. Howard Marks, another investor, spoke at the same conference. “It's not an investment [...] it's a trade,” he said. “In the long run, I think it will be shown not to have any substance.” People who buy Bitcoin, in his opinion, are only doing so because they hope someone will buy it from them at a higher price. When he was a kid, he said, they called it “the greater fool theory.”  This comment rings similar to what Bill Gates said about Bitcoin. Gates and his comments have been ridiculed in the space ever since. Meanwhile, Marc Lasry, hedge fund manager, disagrees with his colleagues. In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, he said that the price of Bitcoin could reach USD 40,000 as it goes more mainstream. As for why he prefers Bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies, he said, “The reason why I like Bitcoin is because it's the one everybody is going to come to.” Also, after buying his first bitcoin a few years ago he says that now he's invested around 1% of its personal funds in this cryptocurrency. However, when asked by the show host what the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is today, Lasry replied: ""I have no idea."" His comments hearken to those of Tim Draper, a famous early investor in groundbreaking projects such as the internet, Tesla, Skype and Hotmail among others. He famously said that Bitcoin will be “bigger than the internet, bigger than the Iron Age, the Renaissance” and that its price will reach USD 250,000 within four years. As to how he knows that, he joked that “spirits told me.” Who is going to be right is probably the question of the decade, as the world shifts to watch the young industry grow. Key financial institutions battle among themselves as to who will be first to implement blockchain in their own solutions."
1," Yesterday, we discussed a crucial hurdle for bitcoin buyers near the 100-day SMA at USD 7,600. BTC/USD tested the mentioned resistance and faced heavy sell offers. As a result, the price started a downward correction and declined below USD 7,500. However, the price remains well supported on the downside near USD 7,150 and USD 7,080. Similarly, there were bearish moves in altcoins like ethereum and ripple, but both are currently trading near important support levels. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price corrected lower and traded towards the USD 7,275 level. Losses were limited in BTC/USD and the pair started consolidating. The price is currently down roughly 1.4% (UTC 09:00) with an immediate support at USD 7,275. Below this, the price may perhaps test a key pivot support at USD 7,150.
On the upside, the price is facing a significant resistance near USD 7,550 and USD 7,600. A successful daily close above these resistances could further accelerate gains in bitcoin.  Ethereum
Ethereum price was under pressure and declined below the USD 500 support. ETH/USD is down around 5% and is currently trading above USD 470 support. Below this, the next key support awaits near USD 460.
On the upside, the USD 500 level is once again a major resistance, above which, the price is likely to resume its upward move toward the USD 515 and USD 525 levels. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price corrected lower, but it is holding a key support at USD 800. BCH/USD must stay above the USD 780 - USD 800 support zone to move back higher. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the USD 830 level, followed by the USD 850 level.
Ripple price trimmed most of its gains and declined below the USD 0.50 support. It is a bearish sign, but if the XRP/USD pair manages to hold the USD 0.48 support, it could recover once again. Other Altcoins Market Today
There were sharp declines in a few altcoins like aion, LOOM, DROP, POWR, WAX, WAN and ETHOS. However, there are still many bullish signs on the charts, suggesting that dips remain supported. Bitcoin price could correct further lower, but there are many key supports on the downside such as USD 7,150, USD 7,080, USD 7,000, and USD 6,850. Once the current correction is complete, BTC/USD may resume its uptrend."
1," In two separate sessions yesterday, the US House Committee on Agriculture and the Congressional Subcommittee on Monetary Policy held hearings on issues surrounding digital currencies and Blockchain technology. The Monetary Policy Subcommittee hearing was titled “The Future of Money: Digital Currency,” and discussed, among other things, whether it would be a good idea for central banks to introduce their own digital currencies. Speaking at the hearing, Alex Pollock, senior fellow at the libertarian-leaning think-tank R Street Institute, said that “to have a central bank digital currency is one of the worst financial ideas of recent times, but still it’s quite conceivable.” He explained his view by saying that digital currencies issued by a central bank would only increase the size and power of the central bank over ordinary citizens. Further, Pollock added that “I don’t think the fundamental nature of money will change – it will surely be a monopoly issuance by a central bank,” adding that “it might be a private currency backed by reliable assets.” Pollock finally concluded his statement by saying “I don’t think it will be a private fiat currency like Bitcoin.” Meanwhile, the hearing in the House Committee on Agriculture stood out as more technical and detailed than previous hearings, with experts describing Blockchain technology as a new type of digital infrastructure, or a new type of foundational technology, in the same way as the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) email protocol was. Amber Baldet, CEO of blockchain startup Clovyr, said at the hearing that the technology is still in its early state, arguing that the US should take the lead with a more “proactive approach to regulation,” much in the same way as the US did with the Internet.

1," Bitcoin’s (BTC) minor price pullback yesterday has likely recharged the bulls for a rally towards $8,000, technical charts indicate. The leading cryptocurrency has spent a better part of the last 15 hours trading in the $7,240–$7,440 range, having clocked a 40-day high of $7,588 at 18:00 UTC yesterday. Moreover, BTC was looking overbought at multi-week highs, hence a minor correction was expected. More importantly, the price pullback and the subsequent consolidation, when viewed against the backdrop of the high volume inverse head-and-shoulders breakout, indicate that BTC has likely gathered steam for a more sustainable rally towards $8,000. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $7,400 on Bitfinex – up 0.2 percent on a 24-hour basis.  While BTC’s rally has stalled in the last 24 hours, the bias remains bullish since prices are holding well above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline support (former resistance) of $6,838. The relative strength index (RSI) is hovering above 50.00 (in bullish territory). The 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are trending north, indicating a bullish setup. The chart also shows a bullish crossover between 5-day and 50-day MAs. What’s more, the Bollinger Bands (standard deviation of +2, -2 on the 20-day MA) are beginning to rise in favor of the bulls and the upper Bolliger Band is offering price support. Clearly, bitcoin remains on the hunt for $8,000 and the short duration chart indicates the move could happen in the next 48 hours.  The Bollinger Bands narrowed at 00:00 UTC yesterday, meaning price volatility (as represented by the gap between the Bollinger Bands) has remained low for more than 24 hours. As a result, we could in for a big move in either direction as an extended period of low volatility is often followed by a period of high volatility. That said, the big move will likely happen on the higher side as the RSI is beginning to rise, after having built a base around 46.00 in the last 15 hours. Meanwhile, the major moving averages (50-hour, 100-hour and 200-hour) have caught up with rising prices, which indicates BTC markets are no longer overstretched.  The averages are located one below the other, indicating the path of least resistance is to the upside.

1," Marc Lasry Predicts: Bitcoin has been on a run this week. The coin made a whopping and sudden 10% gain yesterday and it is still heading skyward. Currently, it is sitting pretty at $7,457. This week’s gains are surprising to some considering Bitcoins recent moves; it seemed everything was steadily going southward. Avenue Capital Group CEO, Marc Lasry, has always regretted not buying Bitcoin when it was $300. The billionaire spoke of his regret back in December and has spoken out favorably for the coin again today with a bullish prediction that it will hit the $40k mark this year.  In an interview with CNBC’s “Squawk Box”, the billionaire also added: “As it gets more into the mainstream, and as more markets end up allowing it to trade where it’s freely tradable, to me that’s more of the bet.” If this week’s gains are to continue he may be right."
1," Bitcoin (BTC) is having a phenomenal 24 hours on the market; a bull run we haven’t seen from the digital currency in months. Let’s check in on the Bitcoin price. Last week, Bitcoin had an unimpressive week on the market, but it seems to have turned itself around as BTC has seen over a 15% increase in just seven days. This doesn’t compare to the percentage gains the cryptocurrency was seeing towards the end of last year, but it’s a positive step. This morning, Bitcoin gained over $10 billion in total market cap in just under an hour. The push by the world’s first cryptocurrency has caused the market to rise right along with it, and two altcoins, Cardano (#8) and Stellar (#6), are currently seeing percentage gains above 25%. At press time, BTC is trading at $7,442.51 a coin, up 10.66% in 24 hours. Bitcoin hasn’t seen this price point in over a month. The world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum (ETH), is also seeing percentage gains. At press time, ETH is trading just under $500 at $496.75 a coin, up 5.53% in 24 hours. For months, the main news circulating around cryptocurrency has been about hacks, regulations, and celebrity skeptics. The news has caused many investors to lose confidence in the cryptocurrency space and is the reason why the market has been on a decline since early May. What might have turned it all around the past couple of days was the BlackRock announcement. BlackRock is the world’s largest exchange-traded fund and the company’s CEO announced that BlackRock was forming its own group to look into cryptocurrencies. This announcement hit the masses on Monday morning and caused Bitcoin (BTC) to spike nearly 6% instantaneously. Yesterday, Bitcoin spiked 10% in less than an hour, and it was speculated that Goldman Sach’s CEO was to thank. News broke that his company is preparing to launch a ‘proper’ crypto trading platform. This morning, Mastercard announced that it is filing another blockchain patent—which most likely aided the spike in Bitcoin further this morning. How high will Bitcoin go? We shall see!

1," Bitcoin price started a solid bullish move from the USD 6,700 support area. BTC/USD surged and broke a couple of important resistances such as USD 6,850 and USD 7,000. It registered more than 10% gains and traded close to USD 7,550, with no obvious news spurring the price rise. Altcoins also followed bitcoin’s path and rallied sharply. Large cap coins like ADA, BCH, EOS, TRX, and XLM were among the top performers. The recent upward drift in bitcoin is a great sign and indicates that the market is back in the green zone. Fundamentally, there were many possible reasons for the current trend, including Coinbase’s move into the broker-dealer space.  A few other possible factors were - BlackRock exploring the crypto space, CFA Institute, a global association of investment professionals, adding cryptocurrencies and blockchain topics to its Level I and II curriculums, and fresh inflows of funds sparked buying interest in bitcoin and altcoins. Possibly, even Charlie Lee’s (Litecoin creator) tweet to own at least 1 Bitcoin before buying any altcoins sparked some buying interest.
(Watch Tom Lee, co-founder and head of Fundstrat Global Advisors, commenting on bitcoin's breakout here.) Meanwhile, market analysts say new money coming into the market could have created a short squeeze, forcing traders who bet against bitcoin to buy the digital currency to cover their losses. “Investors would be wise to remain cautious, as we saw a similar situation in April where some big short positions were squeezed causing the price to surge. That said, if bitcoin pushes past USD 8,000, it’ll indicate that the bull is back and prices could continue to climb further,” Matthew Newton, market analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, said. Technically, bitcoin price formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern recently, and broke the neckline resistance at USD 6,850 to start a significant upward move. At present (UTC 08:00 AM), BTC/USD is facing a tough resistance near the 100-day simple moving average at USD 7,600 level. A break above this is required for an upward acceleration towards the USD 8,000 resistance. If the price corrects lower from the current levels, an initial support awaits at USD 7,200. Below this, the previous resistances at USD 7,000 and USD 6,850 are likely to act as strong supports. Ethereum
Ethereum price finally broke the USD 500 resistance and traded towards the USD 415 level. ETH/USD is currently correcting lower towards the USD 490 and USD 480 support levels.
On the upside, a break above the USD 515 level could open the doors for a push towards the USD 525 level in the near term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price surged more than 7% and broke the USD 820 and USD 850 resistance levels. BCH/USD traded close to the USD 900 level and is currently down to USD 855. An immediate support is at USD 850, followed by USD 840.
Ripple price extended gains above an important resistance at USD 0.50. XRP/USD even broke the USD 0.52 resistance before retreating to USD 0.51. On the downside, the previous resistance at USD 0.50 may perhaps act as a support. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many altcoins rallied today, including ardor, ELF, STRAT, XLM, ADA, EOS and DOGE. Out of these, ardor and ELF were the best performers surging 40% and 20% respectively. To sum up, bitcoin’s recent surge is signaling a sharp increase in buying sentiment. It seems like bitcoin and altcoins are likely to remain in an uptrend in the coming days."
1," Charlie Lee, the creator of the Litecoin cryptocurrency, may have raised some eyebrows on Twitter on Tuesday as he told his followers to try to own at least 1 Bitcoin before buying any altcoins, saying “there isn’t even enough BTC to go around for EVERY millionaire to own one,” while adding “once you have 1 BTC, buy all the s**tcoins you want!” Coincidentally, Bitcoin recorded strong gains both Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, surging by as much as 12% in less than an hour on Tuesday and rising above USD 7,000, first time since beginning of June. The gain followed a boost in bitcoin trading volume across popular exchanges. (Watch Tom Lee, co-founder and head of Fundstrat Global Advisors, commenting on bitcoin's breakout here.) Lee reacted:  _____ However, because of his original tweet, Lee faced a backlash from proponents of his own cryptocurrency, with some accusing him of talking down Litecoin and asking if he is abandoning the coin he created. Lee, however, dismissed all concerns. I'm spending my full time on Litecoin. What do you do for Litecoin? Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million coins, while 4 million coins are reportedly lost forever. Litecoin’s supply is capped at 84 million coins. It currently ranks as the 6th most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap.com.  While it is true that Bitcoin has outperformed Litecoin since the beginning of this year, both coins tend to follow each other closely. The chart below shows the performance of Bitcoin (red line) vs. Litecoin (blue line) year-to-date, using price data from Coinbase."
1," With Tuesday’s dramatic $600 bitcoin rally came a sharp rise in trading volume, more specifically a 100 percent increase from its 7-month volume low set just four days ago. As of Monday, bitcoin’s 24-hour trading volume had fallen to $2.92 billion, a level last seen on November 7. However, as price volatility tends to follow dramatic volume lows, bitcoin’s breakout yesterday was no exception to the rule: 24-hour trading volume reached $5.9 billion. All in all, this marked a 103.7 percent increase from the 36-week low set this past Saturday. On some exchanges, volumes even set records. A popular high-leverage trading cryptocurrency exchange, Bitmex, experienced its highest bitcoin trading volume in an 8-hour window ever during the price surge yesterday. As seen in the chart below, the value recorded was north of $2.4 billion.  Further, this week’s bitcoin trading volume is already well on its way to surpassing that of the prior week. Since Monday, the cryptocurrency’s trading volume is already above 115,000 BTC units, surpassing 90 percent of the total volume recorded in the prior full week, according to data from the Bitfinex exchange.  Breaking the long-term trend of declining volume could prove crucial for the bitcoin bulls if they wish to regain long term composure, and this week’s action is a step in the right direction.

1," Bitcoin (BTC) could be in for a minor price pullback, having clocked a 39-day high above $7,500 earlier today. The leading cryptocurrency rose to $7,562 on Bitfinex at 03:00 UTC and was last seen changing hands at $7,400 – up nearly 10 percent on a 24-hour basis. Further, the price rally has pushed the week-on-week gains higher to 15 percent. On Tuesday, BTC crossed the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance of $6,838 with strength, confirming a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change. So, a rally to $7,900 (inverse head-and-shoulders breakout target) could be on the cards. However, the move may not happen in the next 24 hours as the retreat from $7,562 to $7,370 indicates the bulls are keen on booking profits, having pushed BTC higher by more than $1,300 in the last 72 hours. Further, the technical charts are also reporting intraday overbought conditions, meaning a price pullback could be in the offing before the rally continues. Moreover, investors who missed the initial move higher would have the opportunity to board the BTC freight train on any price pullback. A minor correction, if it occurs, could end up recharging the engines for a sustained rally to $7,900–$8,000. The above chart shows BTC has pulled back from near 100-day moving average (MA) hurdle of $7,613. Still, the bias remains bullish as the cryptocurrency has found acceptance above the 50-day MA. The short-term moving averages (5-day, 10-day) are rising in favor of the bulls and the 5-day MA has cut the 50-day MA from below, confirming a bullish crossover. What’s more, the relative strength index (RSI) has also adopted a bullish bias (above 50.00). As a result, BTC is more likely to extend the rally to $7,900–$8,000 in the short-run and confirm a successful reentry in the pennant pattern. That would be a major blow to BTC bears as the bearish pennant breakdown in June had signaled a revival of the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached in December. A move back inside the pennant pattern would signal a long-term bearish invalidation. Meanwhile, a break above the pennant resistance, currently seen at $8,210, would strengthen the odds of a long-run bullish reversal.  The RSI is beginning to roll over from the overbought territory (above 80.00) and the price pullback will likely gather pace if RSI drops below support at 58.00. Hence, we are unable to rule out a drop in BTC prices to $7,000. That said, the dip is expected to be short-lived as the 50-hour MA, 100-hour MA, and 200-hour MA is located one above the other, indicating the path of least resistance is to the upside.

1," The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization exploded in price Tuesday, jumping $600 in 30 minutes to break away from what had been suppressive bear market conditions. But entering Wednesday, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,370 and showing signs it might continue its ascent. In fact, when viewed on longer timeframes, it appears that the trend is changing, this time in favor of the always-optimistic bulls. But just how reliable is this move? So far, there are three general tools traders are using to analyze the markets in a quest to confirm that the change in trend will have staying power.  Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) act like signals that provide crucial insights into the asking bid as well as the momentum behind each major move. As such, they can be used to confirm or deny a trend change by analyzing the position of the EMA in relation to the current price. The longer the EMA, the more significant the move is as it has more data points to collect from and a greater range of price history. Stepping back, the number 55 is a Fibonacci number that technical traders use in relation to other Fibonacci sequences including 8,11 and 21 (usually skipping 34). It can provide crucial information about the current health of a particular stock or asset, and works best when viewed from longer time-frames. For example, from May 11 to July 16, the 55 EMA for bitcoin was above the price acting as a barrier or resistance to any major moves past $6,860 (see positioning of red EMA). Until yesterday, the position of the exponential moving average remained unchallenged, solidifying the bearish perspective over a two-month period. However, the recent bitcoin surge forced the EMA below the current price, confirming that the breakout is both significant and bullish in the mid-term.  Extensions and retracements are used to predict the levels of resistance and support for an underlying stock or asset. (You can use the Fibonacci tool to identify where the most likely region of major resistance or support lies). To draw an extension for bitcoin, take the cursor to the bottom of the previous significant low (June 26) and draw it up toward the significant two month high seen May 5th. Above is an example of specific resistances/supports where historically, they have held and broken through. Any major moves above the neutral Fibonacci extension at 0.5 would add confirmation to the bullish bias for the short term. If however, bitcoin is unable to break that key resistance, a retracement would be more likely whereby the price would need to come down as conditions become overbought. Prices generally retract or extend between the 38.2 percent, 50 percent and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels and are best used in conjunction with other technical indicators such as the exponential moving averages previously mentioned or trading volume.  Another telling sign for traders is the total volume for an underlying stock or asset, so the amount of bitcoin that changed hands in a 24-hour period can be a crucial tell into whether or not the move above $7,000 is meant to last. Above, we see how volume for bitcoin reached a 3-month high yesterday, almost doubling the day prior. As volume increases over a general period, the price action becomes stronger as there is more liquidity and greater buy/sell opportunities to be had than in a low liquidity market. Keep a keen eye on the volume as it is one of the greatest indicators in determining the strength of a particular move in relation to the amount traded.

1," Bitcoin price registered healthy gains and climbed above a few important resistance levels such as USD 6,600 and USD 6,700. BTC/USD is now placed in a solid uptrend and the current price action is signaling more gains in the near term. Altcoins also followed bitcoin and traded higher between 5-30%. Ethereum performed well and it seems like ETH/USD may perhaps trade towards USD 500 in the near term. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price started a major upward move this week and gained traction above the USD 6,500 pivot level. BTC/USD climbed more than 5% and traded towards the USD 6,750 level. The price is currently trading in a range with an immediate support at USD 6,680.
Below the USD 6,680 support, the price may well test the USD 6,600 support. On the upside, a break above the USD 6,750 high is likely to push the price towards the USD 6,850 resistance. Above this last, the price may possibly test the USD 7,000 level. Ethereum
Ethereum price followed bitcoin’s price action and surged above the USD 450 and USD 460 resistance levels. ETH/USD even broke the USD 475 resistance and tested the USD 480 level. 
The current price action indicates that ETH/USD could continue to move higher with supports at USD 465 and USD 460. On the upside, a break above the USD 480 level is likely to set the pace for a test of USD 500. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price performed really well and surged by more than 10% to climb above the USD 800 resistance. BCH/USD is now placed nicely in an uptrend above USD 750 and it may trade towards USD 850 in the coming days.
Ripple price finally broke a crucial resistance at USD 0.45, opening the doors for more gains. XRP/USD is currently trading above the USD 0.475 level with an immediate resistance at USD 0.48 and USD 0.49. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins registered gains during the past few hours, including tenx, POWR, LOOM, dogecoin, LRC, decred, WAX and enigma. Out of these, tenX posted 39% gains, and POWR broke the USD 0.35 resistance to climb 23%. Overall, bitcoin and altcoins gained significantly and if the current market sentiment remains intact, there could be more upsides. BTC/USD possibly will move above USD 6,800, ETH/USD is likely to test USD 500 and BCH may perhaps accelerate towards USD 850."
1," Bitcoin (BTC) scaled the crucial 50-day moving average (MA) on Monday for the first time in nearly two months, taking its price above $6,700. The corrective rally picked up the pace 24 hours ago, possibly due to reports stating that BlackRock, INC – the world’s largest asset manager and exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider – is considering venturing into cryptocurrency markets. Later in the day, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink clarified rumors by stating that he doesn’t see a huge demand for cryptocurrencies from clients, Still, BTC remained bid and closed (as per UTC) above the 20-day MA for the first time since May 20, validating the argument that a short-term bottom has been made at $5,755 (June 24 low). While a move above the 50-day MA is encouraging, it does not qualify as a bullish reversal.  Only a convincing break above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline of $6,838 would confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,720 on Bitfinex – up 5 percent in the last 24 hours – and the 50-day MA is located at $6,720.  BTC’s rally from the two-week low of $6,080, hit on Thursday, to today’s high of $6,771 has established a higher low (bullish pattern) on the daily chart. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has moved above 50.00 (in bullish territory) and the short-term moving averages (5-day, 10-day) are beginning to rise in favor of the bulls. So, the cryptocurrency looks set to test $6,838 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline hurdle), albeit after a minor intraday pullback as the short-duration charts are flashing overbought conditions.  The RSI is stationed well above 70.00, indicating the rally from $6,080 is overdone. So, prices could revisit the 10-candle MA support of $6,580 in the next few hours.

1," BlackRock exploring crypto: The CEO of the world’s largest exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider, BlackRock, just announced that his company has assembled a group to look into cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC). Larry Fink told Reuters that he does not see “massive investor demand” currently, but his company will continue to look into cryptocurrency regardless. Fink didn’t have much to add to his statement, but any news regarding BlackRock potentially making moves into the cryptocurrency space is good news. As of June 30th, the company has managed nearly $6.4 trillion in assets. A spokesperson from BlackRock sent an email to CNBC about the latest company news and said: “We have been looking at blockchain technology for several years, recognizing potential for shared processes and data across market participants, clearing, settlement and reconciliation and simplified securities issuance.” This working group was established back in 2015, but it seems that the group may be eyeing cryptocurrencies more closely now. The cryptocurrency market jumped up this morning as news spread about the ETF provider’s interest in crypto. News like this gives investors confidence, but will it last? Lately, there has been nothing but news about cryptocurrency regulations around the world, which has driven the market down to its year-low of just over $235 billion on June 29th. While this BlackRock news isn’t really new news at all, it does show that the company is serious about its explorations. The CEO’s comments this morning may have been to boost his company’s image, as Blackrock’s main competitor, Fidelity, has been exploring blockchain extensively for quite some time. At press time, the total cryptocurrency market is trading just below $266 billion. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $6,606.76 a coin, up 3.86%, in 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) is also seeing gains trading at $472.26 a coin, up 5.57%. >> Stellar (XLM) and Cardano (ADA) Among Five Coins Coinbase is Considering Featured Image: buran-energia.com"
1," Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, said on Monday that the world’s largest asset manager has put together a team to look at blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, Reuters reported. However, Fink argues that he does not see massive investor demand. In an interview with Reuters, Fink said that the company is still exploring all options: “We are a big student of blockchain.” Meanwhile, in a separate interview, the CEO told Bloomberg ""I don’t believe any client has sought out crypto exposure"". Also, when asked if he feels the need to be prepared for the day when clients might want exposure, Fink said, ""at the moment, no."" In either case, markets reacted positively - Bitcoin’s price, which is up by 4% in the past 24 hours as of the time of writing, sitting at USD 6,630.96.  Reuters stressed that “any move to invest in cryptocurrencies or to use blockchain by BlackRock would mark a pivot for the company and a major institutional endorsement for the insurgent technology,” as the company managed USD 6.3 trillion in assets as of June 30. Fink has previously called Bitcoin “speculative,” claiming that it thrives because of its anonymity - or, more precisely, pseudonymity. During that particular interview with Reuters last November, he also noted Bitcoin’s association with money laundering. However, in February, Richard Turnill, Global Chief Investment Strategist for BlackRock, wrote in a report that cryptocurrencies has the potential to become more widely used in the future as the markets mature. As it often happens, Bitcoin’s rise in price has boosted up other cryptocurrencies as well: the top 10 coins by market cap are in the green, with single-digit increases in percentage. A bull run may still be far away, but the community hopes to catch a break from the current bearish market, at least."
1," It’s been almost ten years since the inception of Bitcoin, and explaining it to a layman still falls hard. Many explanations have surfaced in these years, yet perhaps none as compelling and different than the one that visualizes Bitcoin transactions as bus passengers. TxStreet.com is a website that translates real-time transaction data from the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash networks into cartoons of passengers looking something like South Park characters boarding a series of buses, complete with sound effects of running engines. It partly showcases the differences between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash - perhaps most obvious from the number of passengers, where Bitcoin vastly outnumbers Bitcoin Cash due to popularity.  Each of the characters waiting or boarding the buses is a payment moving from one account to another, and their size directly corresponds to the amount of money being sent. Walking speed reflects whether or not the sender has paid a system fee to speed the confirmation. Each bus is a block of transactions that departs whenever a block of transactions is confirmed by a network and added to the blockchain. The Bitcoin Cash bus station has 32 buses waiting, representing the 32 megabytes of transaction data that each Bitcoin Cash block has available. Bitcoin, meanwhile, only has two, representing two megabytes - but one is SegWit, a solution implemented to “squeeze” more passengers onto the bus as a solution to Bitcoin’s scalability issues. The building next to the Bitcoin bus station is Lightning House, representing the Lightning Network. The creator of the website, whose Twitter handle is @revofever, explained to Fortune:  The website was inspired in part by TxHighway.com, a similar visualizer explicitly aimed at promoting Bitcoin Cash. TxStreet’s creator, whose Twitter handle is @revofever, told Fortune that promotion was not the goal when creating the website, saying “I was motivated to show each blockchain as accurately and fairly as possible. If the truth promotes Bitcoin Cash, then it is what it is.”"
1," This past week, we saw a bearish reaction in bitcoin below the USD 6,400 support. BTC/USD even broke the USD 6,250 support, but losses were contained well above the USD 6,000 level. Later, the price started trading in a tight range before starting an upward move. The current price action indicates that bitcoin opened the week with bullish signs and if it breaks the USD 6,500 resistance, there could be more gains. Altcoins like ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash also followed a positive path with a couple of breaks above key resistances.  Bitcoin
Bitcoin price made a nice upward move after trading towards USD 6,080. BTC/USD broke the USD 6,250 resistance and is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) trading in a positive zone. However, a major weekly resistance is near USD 6,500. 
A successful break above the USD 6,500 resistance may perhaps set the pace for a larger bullish move during the coming days. If the price fails to move above USD 6,500, there could be a fresh bearish reaction. Weekly supports are at USD 6,250 and USD 6,080. Ethereum
Ethereum registered solid gains during the past three sessions and trimmed most of its last week losses. More importantly, ETH/USD recently broke the USD 450 resistance, opening the doors for more gains.
The next key weekly resistances awaits near USD 460 and USD 475. Above this last, the price could test the USD 500 level. On the downside, supports are visible near USD 440 and USD 420. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price was successful in moving above the USD 700 resistance. BCH/USD is currently up more than 2.5% and it seems like it may well test the USD 740 resistance. Above the stated resistance, the price will most likely surge towards the next hurdles at USD 780 - USD 800.
Ripple price is moving higher, but it is yet to break the USD 0.45 resistance. Once XRP/USD surpasses the USD 0.45 resistance, it could clear the path for further upsides in the near term. Other Altcoins Market Today
The market sentiment improved during the past few sessions, sending many small cap altcoins in a positive zone. Today, a few altcoins like MOAC, tenx, kin, DGB, MCO and 0x posted more than 10% gains. Out of these MOAC surged 23% and tenx gained roughly 20% to break the USD 0.85 resistance. To sum up, bitcoin and altcoins opened the week with bullish moves. However, BTC/USD must break the USD 6,500 resistance to maintain the current positive sentiment. The next weekly resistances are USD 6,800 and USD 7,000."
1," Having defended $6,000 last week, bitcoin (BTC) appears to be building momentum for a price rise, but nearby technical hurdles still present a formidable challenge. At press time, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,689 on Bitfinex and looks to be gaining steam for another test of $6,838. As such, the level is shaping up to be a make-or-break mark, one that could reveal if a classic trend reversal pattern, known as the inverse head-and-shoulders, will take effect. Indeed, a close above that level would amount to a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and open doors for a rally to $7,900 (a target measured by adding the distance from the resistance to the recent low with the break-out level). So, while the bulls may feel emboldened by a possible inverse head-and-shoulders breakout, they are cautioned against being too ambitious. The area between $7,000 – $7,100 hosts more relevant technical hurdles that need to be penetrated in order to prove the bull case. Bitcoin has failed to absorb offers (supply) around $6,850 several times since June 11th, establishing it as a key technical hurdle. (Traders use a tool called the Fibonacci retracement to identify support and resistance levels). Interestingly, the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement from May high of $9,900 happens to be in the same area, according to Bitfinex Exchange. While bulls would have liked to breach resistance on an earlier attempt, the consistent rejection is allowing for an inverse head and shoulders reversal pattern to take form. A convincing break would confirm the inverse head and shoulder reversal, shifting short-term trend into bullish favor. Bitcoin would then likely attack long-term trendline resistance located at $7,050, as seen in the chart below. It’s no secret that bitcoin has been in a commanding bear grip since reaching its all-time high of $19,891 in December of 2017, a picture painted by the long-term downtrend line seen in the chart below.  If the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern takes form, the trendline of resistance would likely be tested in the following hours or days. For a comparable view in bitcoin history, the infamous 2014 bear market formed a similar market structure:  The market finally rebounded after a break and finding support on the downtrend line on Aug. 25, 2015. A convincing break and close above of the current downtrend would carry strong bullish implications surely to shift the intermediate term trend into bullish favor – opening the doors for a move to $7,900 (as per inverse head-and-shoulders measured height method). A rejection from the trendline would likely give an edge back to the bears. Looking down the line, August will be a month every cryptocurrency investor pays close attention to, as the SEC will make a decision regarding the recent CBOE ETF proposal. An approval would be a historic event, as it would open the doors for much awaited institutional investment – a potential inflow of funds bitcoin has never seen before. With that said, another ETF rejection could be just enough of a momentum killer to return bitcoin’s trend into bearish hands.

1," Bitcoin is eyeing change of fortunes above $6,800, having convincingly scaled a key moving average hurdle earlier today. At press time, BTC is changing hands at a six-day high of $6,600 on Bitfinex – up 3.44 percent on the day. The cryptocurrency remained bid over the weekend and rose to $6,400 as expected despite low investor participation. For instance, prices rose above $6,300 on Saturday, but trading volumes fell to $2.92 billion, the lowest level since November 7, according to CoinMarketCap. However, the solid move above the 20-day moving average (MA) resistance of $6,400 seen today is backed by a pick-up in trading volume. As of writing, 24-hour trading volume stands at $4.64 billion – up more than 50 percent from the 36-week lows seen on Saturday. Thus, rally looks sustainable and could be extended further towards $6,838 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance). BTC’s recovery from $6,080 (Thursday’s low) and a rally to $6,600 has created a higher low (bullish setup) on the chart. The relative strength index (RSI) is also biased toward the bulls (above 50.00). So, prices look set to test the key resistance at $6,838 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance). Essentially, BTC is now creating the right shoulders of the inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern. Still, there is merit in being cautious as the cryptocurrency looks overbought as per the short duration charts.  The relative strength index (RSI) is at the highest level since April 24, meaning the cryptocurrency is at its most overbought in nearly three months. Hence, a  break above $6,838 might remain elusive for another 24-hours or could be short-lived for the time being.

1," Bitcoin price declined further below the USD 6,100 level, but losses were limited. BTC/USD bounced back and is currently trading above the USD 6,200 level. Ethereum dived below the USD 420 level, but later it jumped back above USD 430. Similarly, many altcoins recovered and are currently showing positive signs. Going forward, bitcoin could either extend gains above USD 6,300 or it may perhaps decline back towards USD 6,000. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price formed a new weekly low near the USD 6,070 level and recovered sharply. BTC/USD jumped back above the USD 6,180 and USD 6,200 resistances to trim most of its losses. 
However, bitcoin buyers are facing many challenges near the USD 6,300 level. It they fail to break the stated resistance, the price could drop again back below USD 6,200. A few key supports on the downside are at USD 6,150, USD 6,070 and USD 6,020. Ethereum
Ethereum price also followed bitcoin and declined to a new weekly low below USD 420. However, ETH/USD found a strong support above USD 415, resulting in a decent comeback.
The price is currently trading above the USD 430 level (UTC 06:00 AM), with an immediate resistance near USD 442. Above this, the price must clear the USD 450 resistance to move into a bullish zone. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price recovered sharply and it is currently fighting to settle above the USD 700 resistance. Should there be an hourly close above USD 700, BCH/USD may well gain traction to move above the USD 720 resistance. On the flip side, a failure might reverse gains and the price could drop back to USD 660.
Ripple price declined towards the USD 0.42 support where buyers emerged. XRP/USD is moving higher, but it must clear the USD 0.45 resistance to move towards the next hurdle near the USD 0.475 level. Other Altcoins Market Today
A few altcoins gained bullish momentum today, including bitcoin gold, dash, ontology, ZRX, VERI, THETA, MITH and STEEM. The best performer was VERI with more than 10% gains. The current price action is slightly positive, but it seems like bitcoin is trading near make-or-break levels. On the upside, a key resistance is at USD 6,300, above which, the price may trade to USD 6,500. On the downside, a break below USD 6,070 could accelerate losses in BTC and altcoins."
1," Bitcoin’s (BTC) sharp recovery from two-week lows hit yesterday has raised the odds of a stronger rally towards $6,400, technical studies indicate. As of writing, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,245 on Bitfinex. BTC was expected to drop below $6,000 in the last 24 hours as the bears were on the offensive following an inverted flag breakdown. However, the intraday oversold conditions likely put a floor under bitcoin prices at the two-week low of $6,080, helping it chart a solid rebound to $6,283 (today’s high). While it is too early to call a bullish reversal, the change of fortune has saved the day for the BTC bulls. Moreover, the probability of BTC’s price charting a picture-perfect inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern would have dropped sharply had BTC found acceptance below $6,000.  The above chart shows BTC created a falling wedge pattern over the last four days, as represented by lower highs and lower lows. Prices crossed the wedge resistance yesterday with strength (backed by a pick-up in volume), signaling the pullback from Monday’s high of $6,820 has ended. The falling wedge breakout also validated the bear-to-bull trend change indicated by the bullish price-relative strength index divergence (higher low on the RSI). So, BTC will likely find acceptance above the immediate resistance $6,270 (50-hour moving average) and rise towards the descending 100-hour MA, currently located at $6,404. While the hourly chart has adopted a bullish bias, the daily chart is still biased to the bears, so the bulls are cautioned against being too ambitious.  The 5-day and 10-day MA are trending south, implying a bearish bias, while the relative strength index (RSI) is holding below 50.00, also indicating the bears are in control. BTC could attack the $6,400 mark, but further gains are ruled out for now as the descending (bearish) 5-day MA and 10-day MA are located at $6,366 and $6,500, respectively. That said, if BTC manages to close (as per UTC) today above 10-day MA, then the doors would open for a re-test of the Monday’s high of $6,820. Bearish scenario: A failure to produce a significant move higher despite the bullish price RSI divergence and the falling wedge breakout would shift risk in favor of a drop to a recent low of $5,755. The downside move will likely gather pace if BTC fails to hold above $6,080 (previous day’s high) over the weekend. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

1," Bitcoin (BTC) may be up slightly at the start of Friday’s session, but it remains to be seen if it can build traction above $6,000. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is now down 37 percent from its May 5th high at $9,996 according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, though it’s rebounded to a crucial support zone at $6,235, according to Bitfinex data. The figure is notable, as it could be argued bitcoin needs a daily close above the previous low at $6,070 to abort bearish outlook for the coming week. This would provide greater confidence to the market as a whole, and could possibly spark another minor bullish revival seen over the last eight days. And so far in today’s session, it appears a bullish reversal pattern might be playing out. The inverse head and shoulders pattern as reported by CoinDesk yesterday continues to remain in play as the bears were unable to push the right shoulder below the neckline located at $6,064, adding to the strong possibility of a head-and-shoulders reversal.  Provided the H&S pattern stands, the Fibonacci Retracement tool (taken from previous high on May 5 to July 12 bottom of the current bullish reversal candle) shows significant resistance awaits at $6,400, $6900, $7,021 and $8,046. The 55 exponential moving average (red line) also remains well above  the current price, which suggests the troubled crypto remains bearish in the long term until prices start to crash through the crucial $7,000 resistance zone. Further, the channel between $6,070 and $7,012 remains an incredible uphill battle for the world’s most infamous digital cryptocurrency.  The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily so far offers some solace to back the current H&S reversal which is currently bouncing from the 41.8 point line, previously seen as resistance. If it holds above and remains within the channel (between 41 and 53) another attempt to push toward previous resistances at $6,472 could be possible.

0," You gotta love the believers. TenX’s co-founder Julian Hosp is definitely bullish about market leader BTC with his prediction for the second half of 2018. At the RISE tech conference in Hong Kong the crypto wallet and card start-up founder said to CNBC: “I predicted for 2018, we’re going to see $5,000 and $60,000. So $5,000, we pretty much hit it, so let’s see if we can do the $60,000. I’m still quite confident.” It’s an interesting range-covering prediction. And while the coin has come “close” to $5,000 this year, it hasn’t actually hit it. The lowest we’ve seen this year is June’s $5,700. The way the market has been faring of late though, bears seem to be holding down the fort and it wouldn’t be a surprising turn of events if BTC did hit the $5K mark.  The appropriate question is ‘When? rather than ‘If’.  On the other end of the scale, reaching $60K (which is triple the amount of Bitcoin’s all-time-high of $20K) would take some major event to push the coin price up there. Hosp does recognize this. He is a believer, but not blindly bullish, stating that it would take a “massive positive event” to send Bitcoin to the moon."
0," Bitcoin buyers fought to prevent a downside break below a key support at USD 6,250. However, sellers had the upper hand, resulting in a sharp decline below USD 6,250. Ethereum is also struggling to hold gains, but it is still above yesterday’s low. The current market sentiment indicates an increased bearish bias, and if bitcoin fails to stay above USD 6,000, there could be heavy losses during the coming sessions. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price failed to stay above the USD 6,250 and USD 6,200 support levels, which is a strong bearish sign. BTC/USD is currently (UTC 8:30 AM) trading above the USD 6,120 support, but it is facing heavy selling pressure.
If the price declines further below USD 6,120, there is a risk of a crucial break below USD 6,000. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 6,300, above which the price may revisit the USD 6,400 pivot level. Ethereum
Ethereum price struggled to move above the USD 445 resistance and is currently down around 1%. However, ETH/USD is still trading above yesterday’s low, which is a short-term positive sign.
Having said that, if the price fails to move above the USD 445 resistance, it could break the USD 425 support to trade towards USD 400 in the near term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price extended its slide and is currently trading near the USD 675 level. An initial support sits at USD 660, followed by USD 650. Below this last, BCH/USD may perhaps move towards the USD 620 level. On the upside, resistances are at USD 690, USD 700 and USD 720.
Ripple price is in a bearish zone below USD 0.45 and it seems like XRP/USD may even break the USD 0.43 level to test the USD 0.42 support. Resistances are sitting near USD 0.445 and USD 0.450. Other Altcoins Market Today
Almost all altcoins are trading in the red zone with losses between 3-12%. The worst performer so far is bitcoin diamond, trading below the USD 2.00 support. Other cryptocurrencies like XIN, VERI, MCO, pundi X, NAS and POWR posted declines more than 8%. Overall, bitcoin and altcoins are struggling to hold the ground. To recover, bitcoin price must move back above the USD 6,300 and USD 6,400 resistance levels."
0," Bitcoin remains the best bet among cryptocurrencies because people are “functionally using it,” Bart Smith, head of digital assets at Susquehanna International Group, a global trading firm that are active in a wide range of markets, told CNBC. He compared bitcoin to ethereum and smaller tokens built on the Ethereum platform by explaining that technologies such as smart contracts and decentralized apps “are very difficult [to use] and aren’t coming any time soon.” “The use case for bitcoin is valid today, which is the currency of the Internet,” he said, adding that “it’s digital gold and it’s a cross-border money transfer which people use.” While discussing bitcoin’s relative resilience as other tokens have sold off heavily, Smith, dubbed “Wall Street’s crypto king” by the show host, also mentioned two important price levels to keep an eye on in the bitcoin market; USD 5,800 and USD 6,800.  (USD 6.362 at press time, according to coinmarketcap.com.) Bitcoin price chart: Smith explained that we are now back at the same price level as “before bitcoin became a financial instrument,” referring to the time before the futures market for bitcoin was launched late last year. “The price seems to be bouncing around [the two price levels], it kind of gets to USD 6,800 and then runs out of steam, and eventually it’s going to break out of that range,” adding that “I think that will be the indicator of new money coming in.” However, China’s Center for Information Industry Development, an organization affiliated with the Chinese central government, wouldn't agree with Smith. In its recent ranking of 30 cryptocurrencies bitcoin now is only 17th.

0," Bitcoin (BTC) traded largely sideways over the last 24 hours, though a dip soon before press time may threaten a developing bullish chart pattern if the price moves below $6,000. BTC’s drop below the 10-day moving average (MA) on Tuesday neutralized the immediate bullish outlook and shifted risk in favor of a sell-off to $6,000. However, the cryptocurrency defended $6,300 yesterday amid intraday oversold conditions, establishing the round figure as a key short-term support. But, the resilience failed to entice bulls, rather a long liquidation (unwinding of long BTC trades) gathered pace, creating downside pressure on prices. Consequently, BTC fell to a low of $6,145 earlier today and was last seen trading at $6,170. Clearly, the risk of a drop below $6,000 has increased substantially in the last few hours. It is worth noting that the probability of BTC’s price charting a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern would drop sharply if the cryptocurrency finds acceptance below $6,000. The bear flag breakdown, a bearish continuation pattern, indicates the sell-off from the recent high of $6,820 has resumed and prices could revisit the June 24 low of $5,755 (target as per the measured height method). The major moving averages (50,100 and 200) are trending south and are located one below the other, signaling the path of least resistance is to the downside. So, a break below $6,000 could be on the cards. The only factor that may help BTC stay above $6,000 is the oversold conditions shown by the relative strength index (RSI). That said, the relief could be short-lived as the RSI on the longer duration charts is biased to the bears.  The RSI is hovering below 50.00 (bearish) but is holding well above the oversold region (below 30.00), which means there is plenty room for a drop towards $5,755 (bear flag breakdown target).  The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern comprises three successive troughs, the middle trough (head) being the lowest and the two outside troughs (shoulders) being low and roughly equal. In BTC’s case, the left shoulder’s low is $6,108. So, BTC needs to create the right shoulder in the range of $6,000-$6,100, i.e. bulls need to defend the support at $6,000 and stage a solid rebound, else the dream of a picture-perfect inverse head-and-shoulders pattern will remain elusive.

1," Yesterday, we discussed that bitcoin must stay above the USD 6,500 support to recover. However, BTC/USD failed to hold the stated support and declined sharply. It dragged all major altcoins lower like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, EOS and litecoin. The market moved into a bearish zone and there is a risk of further declines if sellers remain in action. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price broke a few key supports during the recent decline, including USD 6,500 and USD 6,400. BTC/USD tested the next important support at USD 6,250 and it is currently trading in a range. 
If the price resumes its slide and breaks the USD 6,250 support, there could be a sharp downward move towards USD 6,000. On the flip side, if the price recovers from the current levels, the broken supports at USD 6,400 and USD 6,500 are likely to act as hurdles for further gains. Ethereum
Ethereum price was under a lot of bearish pressure as it dropped by more than 5% and cleared a crucial support at USD 450. ETH/USD traded towards the USD 425 level and is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) consolidating losses near USD 430.
If there is a downside break below USD 425, the price may perhaps test the USD 405 low. On the upside, resistances are sitting near USD 440, USD 450 and USD 455. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price settled below the USD 700 support, which is a bearish sign. BCH/USD may continue to move down towards the next support at USD 650. If there is an upward correction, the pair could face hurdles near USD 700 and USD 720.
Ripple price extended its decline in the bearish zone and broke the USD 0.45 support. It stayed above the USD 0.43 level, but there is a risk of another bearish reaction towards the USD 0.42 support in the near term. Other Altcoins Market Today
Most altcoins faced an increased selling pressure and moved further into the red zone, including gas, stellar, cardano, IOTA, TRON, NEO, XMR and DASH. Two altcoins KCS and POWR gained traction today and moved up by 12% and 8% respectively. The current market sentiment is signaling a bearish bias and if bitcoin price fails to stay above the USD 6,250 support, there could be heavy losses in the coming sessions."
1," Bitcoin (BTC) price could create a major bullish technical pattern in the next few days, technical charts indicate. It’s a slightly confusing picture at the moment, however. The recent short-term bullish bias has been neutralized following BTC’s close below (as per UTC) the 10-day moving average (MA) yesterday. Further, the risk of a deeper pullback to $6,000 (February low and psychological support) look to have increased after Tuesday’s 5.7 percent price drop. However, that does not necessarily mean the bears are back in a commanding position, since the cryptocurrency is still holding well above the recent low of $5,755 (hit on June 24). Notably, BTC could end up creating an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern (bullish pattern) soon if the bears fail to penetrate the immediate support of $6,000 in the next couple of days. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,350 on Bitfinex – down 3.6 percent on a 24-hour basis.  BTC’s drop to $6,260 yesterday left another lower high (bearish pattern) on the daily chart, while the relative strength index (RSI) has rolled over in favor of the bears (is back below 50.00). The 5-day and 10-day MAs are also beginning to slope downwards in favor of the bears. The long-term MAs – 50, 100 and 200 – are located one below the other, indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. Thus, BTC looks set to test $6,000 in the next day or two. Acceptance below that level would expose the recent low of $5,755. However, the short duration charts indicate BTC will likely defend the support at $6,000.  The RSI is already reporting oversold conditions (below 30.00) and another $300 drop would only make it harder for the bears to push BTC below $6,000. Hence, we are unable to rule out a rebound from $6,000 – a move which could end up creating the right shoulder of an inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern, as seen in the chart below.  A long-term bull reversal (bear-to-bull trend change) would be confirmed if BTC bounces off the support at $6,000 and sees a high volume break above $6,832 (neckline resistance). The probability of BTC completing the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern remains high as long as prices are holding above $6,000. Increasing arrow image via Shutterstock"
0," There was a solid increase in selling interest during the past two sessions. Bitcoin declined sharply and broke the USD 6,600 support. However, buyers were able to hold declines below USD 6,500 - USD 6,540. Similarly, Ethereum nosedived and broke the USD 470 and USD 460 supports to test the USD 450 pivot level. The market is clearly under a lot of bearish pressure, but if prices stay above these important supports, there could be a recovery in coming sessions. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price struggled to hold gains above the USD 6,700 support and declined around 2% to test the USD 6,500 support zone. BTC/USD stayed above the stated support and is currently consolidating losses near USD 6,600 (UTC 8:00 AM). It must move back above USD 6,700 to recover and retest USD 6,850.
On the flip side, if the price extends its decline and breaks the USD 6,500 support, it will most likely move back in a bearish zone. The next supports are at USD 6,400 and USD 6,250. Ethereum
Ethereum price dropped more than 5% and cleared the USD 470 and USD 460 supports. However, ETH/USD stayed above the USD 450 support, which is a positive sign.
Having said that, there is still a risk of more losses if sellers succeed in pushing the price below USD 450. On the upside, the USD 470 level is a key resistance for a decent recovery towards USD 485 in the near term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price slowly moved down and almost tested the USD 700 handle. BCH/USD is currently consolidating near USD 720 with an immediate resistance at USD 740. Above this, the price may perhaps revisit the USD 780 resistance.
Ripple price is back in a bearish zone and is currently trading above the USD 0.45 support. Should there be a downside break below USD 0.45, XRP/USD may well decline back towards the USD 0.42 support. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, many small cap altcoins declined heavily, including bitcoin diamond, bancor, cortex, ethos, LOOM, CMT, gas, populous, aion and ZIL. These coins registered losses between 10-25%. Overall, the recent decline in bitcoin and altcoins trimmed most of last week’s gains. It is a bearish sign, but if bitcoin price stays above USD 6,500, the market could stage a comeback in the near term."
0," A few lucky merchants now have one less obstacle to accepting bitcoin payments via the Lightning Network. Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, payment processing startup CoinGate is opening up a pilot program that will allow 100 merchants to trial a Lightning-enabled version of its service, one which taps into the open-source tech meant to make bitcoin transactions fast and cheap. As with CoinGate’s standard service, the company will handle the finer details of crypto-to-fiat exchange, however, the new pilot has the benefit of covering the costs should funds be lost due to the early-stage nature of the software (lightning implementations are now largely in beta). And while most experts believe the network still isn’t ready to support significant commercial transactions, CoinGate CTO Rytis Bieliauskas thinks there’s a greater good that will be achieved in being among the first to test the waters. He told CoinDesk: “It’s a very new technology. Inevitably there will be some bugs, either in our implementation or in the Lightning Network. It will help, not just us, but the whole community because the bugs we find might help the whole protocol.” Although Lightning invoices are typically limited by the protocol itself to 0.042 bitcoin each, or under $300 according to current prices, CoinGate CCO Vilius Semenas told CoinDesk there’s no established limit to how many invoices CoinGate will reimburse if funds are lost. At least for the time being, few shoppers have the resources to send cryptocurrency from a Lightning wallet such as Zap. But this pilot could test whether Lightning actually tackles some of the issues that deter mainstream merchants from prioritizing crypto payments in the first place. For example, bitcoin’s latency presents an issue for CoinGate clients like the Luxembourg-based adult content platform LiveJasmin. “Instant payments are the most important from our point of view,” Tamás Szerencse, head of payments at LiveJasmin, said, expanding on why the company joined CoinGate’s Lightning pilot. With up to 40 million daily visitors, LiveJasmin could become one of the biggest mainstream merchants to experiment with Lightning so far. Experimenting with more diverse transaction types could provide invaluable insight into how Lightning works out in the wild. As such, CoinGate is emerging as one of a small, but growing number of crypto payment processors to take the leap. (Last week GloBee helped crypto hardware wallet accessory provider CryptoCloaks accept its first payment.) Still, most acknowledge there’s still a long way to go until mainstream merchants could safely use Lightning. Steve Beauregard, the founder of the payment processor GoCoin, told CoinDesk he agreed with Bieliauskas that layered networks might be able to reduce friction for recurring payments, but he acknowledged the tech is still in its infancy, which is likely to limit shoppers. “It’s still very complicated for an average end-user to use it [Lightning],” Beauregard said. “I think the ones that benefit the most would be international merchants that are trying to accept payments from overseas.” The majority of merchants who applied for this pilot were businesses like collectibles maker Bitgild, which offers silver and gold coins engraved with QR codes for real cryptocurrency, catering to clients who are already fascinated by Lightning experiments. Beyond cross-border payments, Bieliauskas argued Lightning-enabled transactions could soon provide a cheaper option than credit cards for merchants dealing with micropayments or payments worth a fraction of a penny. For now, Beauregard said the primary value such Lightning pilots offer is an opportunity to participate in experimental research. Speaking to that point, renowned Lightning developer Alex Bosworth agreed this pilot will provide a learn opportunity for the whole network. Lightning’s most useful features for merchants are still in development. Bosworth told CoinDesk: “In the future, one nice thing about Lightning merchants is that if they invoice you in one currency and the payer wants to pay in a different currency, that will be possible.” Bitcoin image via Shutterstock"
0," Bitcoin (BTC) is on the defensive today and could suffer deeper losses in the next few days should the bulls fail to defend the key moving average (MA) support, the technical charts indicate. The leading cryptocurrency looked vulnerable to a pullback 24 hours ago, courtesy of the signs of bullish exhaustion near key resistance of $6,800. Hence, the drop to $6436 seen today is not surprising, but has certainly boosted the odds of a close (as per UTC) below the all-important 10-day moving average (MA). It is worth noting that the short-term moving average is still biased to the bulls (rising). So, as discussed yesterday, a strong defense of the 10-day MA support would reinforce the short-term bullish outlook and could yield a rally to $7,000. As of writing, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,460 on Bitfinex – down 5.5 percent from the high of $6,839 reached over the weekend.  The daily candle has already breached the 10-day MA support of $6,585, however, only a close today (as per UTC) below that level would abort the short-term bullish view put forward by the bullish RSI divergence and the falling channel breakout last week. That said, the probability of BTC closing below the 10-day MA is quite high as the short duration charts have already turned bearish.  The rising channel breakdown indicates the corrective rally from the June 24 low of $5,755 has ended. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has turned bearish (below 50.00). Meanwhile, BTC has also breached the support of 200-candle MA. Clearly, the bears must be feeling emboldened Bitcoin image via Shutterstock"
0," Joseph Stiglitz: Not everyone is a fan of Bitcoin. Despite proclamations from supporters about its revolutionary technology and the “freedom” it offers its users, many are still not convinced. If you’re Bitcoin, it must not bode well for you to have a major critic in the form of Nobel-winning economist and Columbia Professor Joseph Stiglitz. Today, Stiglitz spoke with Financial News of his concern about the adoption of the unregulated financial asset which he believes elicits illegal behaviors as it has no central authority and its users can be totally anonymous. He has spoken to Bloomberg on several occasions before about his distaste for Bitcoin. The economist’s concerns center around the potential for criminal enterprises to take complete advantage of the network: “You cannot have a means of payment that is based on secrecy when you’re trying to create a transparent banking system…If you open up a hole like Bitcoin, then all the nefarious activity will go through that hole, and no government can allow that.” Despite his concerns, he believes that once the market is truly big enough, regulators will enforce rules which would render the coin useless. Currently, the cryptocurrency market is still considered small with a $273 billion market cap, though predictions have placed it nearer to $1 Trillion by the end of 2018. It Stiglitz opinion, the popularity of Bitcoin lies only with criminals and if “you regulate it so you couldn’t engage in money laundering and all these other [crimes], there will be no demand for Bitcoin. By regulating the abuses, you are going to regulate it out of existence. It exists because of the abuses.” Though not a Bitcoin enthusiast, Stiglitz isn’t swearing off cryptocurrency completely. He believes the US could benefit from a more open and transparent digital payment system in order to protect from the corruption that is experienced in our current financial system.  “I believe very strongly that countries like the United States could and should move to a digital currency … so that you would have the ability to trace this kind of corruption.” But what digital currency would be his preference? >>Facebook Appoints Director of Engineering Blockchain. Read it here!  “I’d like us to move more towards an electronic payment [system] but you don’t need a bitcoin for that,” Stiglitz does not stand on this ground alone; Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Jamie Dimon and Christine Lagarde have all expressed similar concerns or criticisms about Bitcoin.

0," The past three days were mostly bullish since bitcoin price traded above the USD 6,600 and USD 6,700 resistance levels. BTC/USD gained traction and even traded to a new monthly high above USD 6,800. It indicates that buyers were successful in overcoming selling pressure and pushed the price in a bullish zone. Altcoins like ethereum and bitcoin cash also traded higher and are consolidating gains. In the short term, there could be a downward correction, but the market could extend gains this week if bitcoin stays above USD 6,500. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price staged a solid uptrend above the USD 6,400 pivot level. BTC/USD climbed higher and broke the USD 6,750 and USD 6,800 resistance levels. It traded to a new monthly high near USD 6,820 before starting a short-term correction.
On the downside, supports are seen at USD 6,700 and USD 6,650. Below USD 6,600, the price could test an important support at USD 6,500. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 6,800, followed by the recent high near USD 6,820. Above this, the price may perhaps trade above USD 6,850. Ethereum
Ethereum broke a crucial resistance near USD 485 and traded towards the USD 500 barrier. However, ETH/USD failed to test the USD 500 level and is currently consolidating gains (GMT 9:00 AM).
A key support sits at USD 475, below which the price may perhaps test the USD 460 support. On the upside, a break above the USD 490 - USD 500 zone is required for a bullish acceleration. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price settled above the USD 740 resistance. However, BCH/USD is facing a lot of hurdles near the USD 780 and USD 800 levels. A push above the USD 800 barrier is needed for buyers to gain control. Supports on the downside are at USD 740, USD 720 and USD 700.
Ripple price traded higher, but it failed to break the USD 0.50 resistance. XRP/USD is currently trading near the USD 0.48 level with resistances at USD 0.490, USD 0.495 and USD 0.500. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins climbed recently, but there was a lack in bullish momentum. Today, a few coins like Digibyte, Nuls, Paypex and Monaco are showing positive signs and are likely to accelerate gains. Overall, the market sentiment improved during the past two days, and it could improve further in the coming days. To accelerate gains, bitcoin price must break the USD 6,850 and USD 7,000 resistances. The most important support for the current uptrend sits near USD 6,500."
0," While heatwaves are making rounds throughout Europe, floods are wreaking havoc in parts of China. While cryptocurrency is not a physical commodity, it is still very much influenced by weather which reportedly managed to bring down the global Bitcoin hashrate, or computing power of the Bitcoin network, showing exactly how important Chinese miners are to the whole industry. Sichuan, a province in southwest China, has recently been hit by heavy floods, rendering thousands homeless and destroying thousands of hectares of crops. The Bitcoin mining farms of the region did not escape unharmed: although owners tried to salvage what they could, photos of abandoned mining rigs are circulating on media. Max Kortrakul, founder and chief executive of social trading platform Carboneum, told Financial Times, “the pictures of the flooding in Sichuan are alarming and give the impression that the Bitcoin hashrate must surely have taken a hit.”  This is not unimaginable, as Chinese miners make up about 50% to 70% of the world’s Bitcoin production. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that the Sichuan floods could affect up to 8%-10% percent of global Bitcoin mining activity. Aaron McDonald, co-founder and chief executive of Centrality, a marketplace of applications, says the hashrate dip is due to the floods, the European heatwave, as well as the dip in price, FT reported. Leo Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association in Hong Kong, says that the suggestion of a 30% drop in the hashrate is the result of the flooding comes down to guesswork. Some analysts even believe that the hashrate dip has got nothing to do with the Sichuan flooding, regardless of the size of the mining community. In the past, local governments around China were trying to “guide” bitcoin miners out of the industry, but the industry has proven to be resilient."
0," It may not have been the asset’s biggest rally, but it’s hard to say bitcoin isn’t building on gains. Since hitting an annual low of $5,785 in June, bitcoin has increased roughly 15 percent against the U.S. dollar, and technical indicators suggest the cryptocurrency might not be calling it quits just yet. That said, you’d be forgiven for having doubts. The rally has been interrupted over the past few days by resistance at $6,800, a level first approached on July 4. With a close of $6,584, the day arguably saw control slip back into the hands of bears eager to drive prices lower. However, bears couldn’t further capitalize as price followed the rejection by entering a narrow trading range of less than $250 over the following two days. (Narrowing ranges typically end in a breakout and this was no exception. As such, bulls were able to swing prices back to $6,840 on July 7.) Still, several technical indications suggest positive sentiment is building and that prices could comfortably rise above $7,000 in the coming days.  After rejecting from the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level (from May high of $10,000) the bitcoin price has formed the continuation pattern of a bull flag. What’s more, the CMF, an indicator used for displaying buy and sell pressure, shows buy pressure is mounting while price is traveling down the flag (a bullish divergence). The 4-hour chart also displays a bullish cross of the 50- and 200-period exponential moving averages (EMA), further adding to the bullish bias. The volume profile visible range shows low volume nodes (LVN) near $6,850-7,000, making the levels easier to be penetrated since it is an area lacking overall investor interest. An inverse head-and-shoulders pattern has also appeared on the 4-hour chart, the neckline of which is the same elusive resistance of $6,800 previously mentioned. A convincing close above the neckline has the potential for the trend reversal pattern to take effect, potentially opening the doors to the next Fibonacci retracement (0.382) near $7,400.  On a wider lens, the price of bitcoin recently found support on the 75-week exponential moving average (EMA) for the second time in two years, granting bulls more time to cross their next hurdle – the descending trend line of resistance. A convincing break of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and the $6,800 level would likely send price to the test the fast approaching trendline and potentially break it. Since technical analysis is largely self-fulfilling prophecy, breaking the widely recognized trendline would increase overall bullish sentiment, potentially setting scope for prices in the higher end of the $7,000 range.

0," Bitcoin (BTC) rally has stalled near a key resistance range and a minor pullback could recharge the engine for a much-awaited move toward the $7,000 mark. At press time, the premiere cryptocurrency is flatlined at $6,710 on Bitfinex, having clocked an 18-day high of $6,839 over the weekend and is showing signs of bullish exhaustion near the resistance range of $6,750 to $7,910. For instance, BTC has failed thrice in the last seven days to hold on to gains above $6,754, which is the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755. Further, BTC has failed to close (as per UTC) above the stiff resistance at $6,800 in the last two days. What’s more, BTC will likely encounter resistance at $6,850 (multiple daily highs clocked in the third week of June). And last but not the least, the 50-day moving average (MA) resistance is lined up at $6,907. Thus, the area between $6,750 to $6,910 is packed with key resistance levels and the signs of exhaustion near the resistance zone have left the doors open for a minor pullback in BTC prices. That said, the pullback could help BTC build steam for a strong move to $7,000 as the technical studies are biased toward the bulls, as seen in the chart below.  The bullish falling channel breakout and the bullish crossover between 5-day and 10-day MA indicate the tide has turned in favor of the bulls for short-term. The relative strength index (RSI) has moved above 50.00, confirming a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change. Car stop sign image via Shutterstock"
1," Tom Lee, co-founder and head of Fundstrat Global Advisors, explained his previous prediction regarding Bitcoin price, noting that “we still think Bitcoin can reach USD 25,000 by the end of the year or something like that.” As reported, when speaking at the Asia Blockchain Summit in Taiwan in July, Lee revised his year-end price prediction for bitcoin from USD 25,000 to USD 22,000.  On Thursday, he told CNBC that ""Bitcoin has historically traded at 2.5 times its mining costs. It's not out of the question that it could be over USD 20,000 by the end of the year at fair value."" Later he clarified his position, saying he ""may have misspoke a little bit"":   ""What I was trying to illustrate was that given where mining costs will be and applying the historical average of 2.5 times mining costs, that would imply fair value over USD 20,000, roughly USD 22,000.” Afterwards, he stressed that bitcoin still can reach USD 25,000 by the end of the year. Still, he maintains that worrying about a few thousand dollars in the current circumstances, as any return even approaching USD 20,000 would be around 200% percent higher than where Bitcoin is right now, which is USD 6,543.67 at the time of writing, according to data from coinmarketcap.com. Lee has previously several times determined that the price of Bitcoin should be at least double the cost of mining. He has earlier predicted that by the end of 2019, a single Bitcoin could be worth anywhere between USD 20,000 and USD 64,000, with an average of USD 36,000. However, his prediction of a bull run following the Consensus 2018 conference in May failed to materialize."
1," In the case of bitcoin’s Q2 price movements, it turns out history didn’t repeat. As the three-month period came to a close this week, the final figures indicate bitcoin fell 8 percent according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), snapping a 7-year win streak for the market’s leading cryptocurrency. As seen in the table below, bitcoin had always put on a good show in the second quarter. For instance, BTC’s 1,964 percent rally in Q2 2011 is its best quarterly performance ever. if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""e6Q1G""]={},window.datawrapper[""e6Q1G""].embedDeltas={""100"":475,""200"":365,""300"":323,""400"":306,""500"":306,""700"":289,""800"":289,""900"":289,""1000"":289},window.datawrapper[""e6Q1G""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-e6Q1G""),window.datawrapper[""e6Q1G""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""e6Q1G""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""e6Q1G""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""e6Q1G""==b)window.datawrapper[""e6Q1G""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""}); Clearly, history was on bitcoin’s side and hence, beleaguered bulls were expecting BTC to regain poise in the second quarter following a 50 percent decline in the first quarter.  Accordingly, the cryptocurrency got off to a great start in April only to print fresh 2018 lows in June. The bearish sentiment hit the extreme in early April as pundits took note of the much-feared “death cross” (a bearish crossover between 50-day moving average and 200-day moving average) and began calling a move lower to $2,800 (a level was last seen in September 2017).  However, the lagging indicator trapped bears on the wrong side of the market as oversold conditions put BTC on a recovery mode. Further, the bullish move gathered traction on reports that Soros and Rockefeller are venturing into crypto waters.  Consequently, by April end, BPI was flashing 33 percent month-on-month gain and looked set to scale the $10,000 mark.  The cryptocurrency had breached the long-term falling trendline (drawn from Dec. 17 high and Jan. 6 high) in April. So, emboldened BTC bulls were anticipating a big break above $10,000, which never happened.  Further, things took a turn for worst in mid-May as BTC prices fell below the key 50-day MA and 100-day MA, signaling the path of least resistance is to the downside.  The cryptocurrency continued losing altitude and closed the month with a 19 percent loss.  BTC remained on the defensive throughout June as the long-term technical indicators turned bearish. The 5-month MA crossed the 10-month MA from above, confirming a bearish crossover for the first time in four years.  Further, BTC found acceptance below the 50-week moving average for the first in over two-and-a-half years and suffered a pennant breakdown (bearish continuation pattern). Consequently, prices fell below $6,000 in June for the first time since November and printed a fresh 2018 low of $5,827. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $6,560, according to the BPI. Technically speaking, the cryptocurrency looks set to test $5,000 in the current quarter, as suggested by the pennant breakdown.  However, amid the gloom and doom, the 75-week MA study is offering a positive outlook for bitcoin. The above chart shows BTC has bounced off the key 75-week exponential moving average (EMA) (MA) support. History shows, the moving average is a make or break level for BTC. For instance, BTC’s last bear market ended with an upside break (marked by a square) of the 75-week EMA at the end of 2015 and what followed was a two-year long bull market. So, while there is a reason to be optimistic, bulls are cautioned against being too ambitious as the long-term descending trendline is still intact. Only a break above that level would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change. That said, the probability of BTC crossing the trendline hurdle in Q3 is high, given the cryptocurrency has rebounded from the key 75-week MA.  Note that bears will likely make a strong comeback should BTC fall back below 75-week MA. Bitcoin and US dollar image via Shutterstock"
1," The price of bitcoin (BTC) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  The trading range’s lower end is $6,341, a double bottom neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC’s rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range.  A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the double bottom breakout and bull flag breakout earlier this week.  On the other hand, the bullish case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341.  That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex – down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.   The bears may feel emboldened by BTC’s transition from rising channel (bullish setup) to falling channel (bearish setup), as seen in the chart above.  Further, Bollinger Bands (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a bearish setup.  BTC is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours (bearish crossover).   The downside break of the rising channel yesterday added credence to the bearish relative strength index (RSI) divergence and strengthened the bear case.  The chart also shows Bollinger Bands that have adopted bearish bias (beginning to fall).  Knot via Shutterstock"
1," Last month, Bitcoin enthusiasts breathed a sigh of relief when they were informed that the Tom Lee Bitcoin price target was $25K by the end of 2018. But a month later, now in the second half of the year, Tom Lee has changed his mind. He now expects that Bitcoin will trade a little over $20,000 by year-end. As the Bitcoin bulls and bears continue to fight, the Fundstrat co-founder has sided with both in certain instances. He admitted that Bitcoin’s trading volume has dropped. He cut his Bitcoin price target. Yet Mr. Lee made it evident Thursday that this is not something investors should fret over. On Thursday, in an interview with CNBC, Lee said that he had cut his price target and expects to see Bitcoin at $22,000 per unit by the end of 2018. That’s 20% less than his previous $25K year-end projection. According to Tom Lee, this is OK. He said any return nearing his $20K forecast for the coin by the end of the year would be an increase of roughly 200%. In May, Bitcoin reached its most recent high, which was around the $9,800 price mark. Since then, BTC has lost roughly 30%. Despite this, Tom Lee believes that Bitcoin, as well as blockchain technology, are only in the “early stages” of their transformation. He even called them a “multidecade story.” Tom Lee appears to be undeterred. However, the new Tom Lee Bitcoin price target may have shocked a few people. Why? Because Lee has stuck by his $25K prediction through thick and thin – even when the Bitcoin price dropped during the 2018 Consensus conference. Are you worried about the slash to the Tom Lee Bitcoin price target? Or, do you share his view that Bitcoin is in the early stages of transformation, and a few thousand is nothing to quibble over? >> Malta: Parliament Approved Blockchain Regulatory Framework Featured Image: Twitter"
1," A post in the immensely popular subreddit r/cryptocurrency garnered a lot of attention, as a user posted pictures of the crypto artwork that they sell, saying that their sales jumped after they started accepting crypto. It wasn’t until early 2018 that Lynx Art, an online art shop, started accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment three months ago. Since then, their sales have jumped 427%, according to the owner’s Reddit comments. However, it does not provide any other financial details. Right now, they accept several cryptocurrencies, including Monero, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Nano. Frankreddit5, the Reddit user, who posted the success story, wrote in a comment, “I just wanted to take a moment to give a sincere thank you to this community. We began business in 2012 but did not begin accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment until early 2018.” He has not yet replied to our request for a comment. Lynx Art started by creating a single poster design which they published online back in 2012. The artwork went viral and, from there, Lynx began rapidly expanding, offering new designs and opening up new partnerships with both artists and marketplaces. You’re not just able to pay with crypto: there is a subcategory for crypto-related art. From NEO, over Qtum and Ark, to one called “FAILED PREDICTIONS OF TECHNOLOGY” and even a humorous Nocoiner metal panel, every crypto aficionado can find something to fit their needs. However, art is not the only thing you can buy with crypto. Classic Recreations is a company modifying and custom fabricating high-performance vehicles in Yukon, Oklahoma. They have announced that they will start accepting cryptocurrencies as a payment option for their custom built-to-order cars and officially licensed continuation vehicles, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Docademic."
1," During the past three sessions, there were mostly range moves in bitcoin and altcoins. BTC/USD corrected a few points recently, found support near USD 6,400, and bounced back. Similarly, there were decent bullish moves in altcoins like ethereum, bitcoin cash, ripple and litecoin. The current price action suggests more positive moves and possibilities of fresh monthly highs in bitcoin, ETH, LTC and XRP. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price found a strong buying interest above the USD 6,400 support. BTC/USD recovered nicely and is currently trading near the USD 6,600 level (GMT 08:30). On the upside, resistances are seen near USD 6,720 and USD 6,780. Above this last, the price will most likely break USD 6,800 for a new monthly high.
Should there be a downside correction, the USD 6,500 and USD 6,400 support levels are likely to stop declines. Below USD 6,400, the price may face an increased selling pressure in the short term. Ethereum
Ethereum price bounced back and is currently trading well above the USD 460 support. ETH/USD must clear the USD 480 resistance to make an attempt to surpass USD 500.
If there is a short term downward move, the price may perhaps test the USD 450 support, which is a strong barrier for sellers. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price is struggling to catch bids and is currently trading flat near the USD 760 level. On the upside, there are many resistances such as USD 780 and USD 800. Above this last, BCH/USD could move into a bullish zone. If not, there is a risk of an extended decline towards the USD 720 support in the near term.
Ripple price is finding it hard to move back above the USD 0.50 resistance. It is currently trading above the USD 0.48 support, but with a few negative signs. If there is a bearish break below USD 0.475, the price may well revisit the USD 0.450 level. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins registered decent gains, including ETHOS, ETN, GAS, MITH, SMART, ZRX, ZIL, SNT and KNC. Neo also performed very well during the past two days as the price successfully moved above the USD 40.00 resistance. Overall, the current market sentiment is neutral-to-bullish. If bitcoin price gains momentum above USD 6,700 and USD 6,800, there could be solid gains in BTC and altcoins."
1," Bitcoin (BTC) needs to overcome a key technical resistance to keep the short-term bull market going, technical studies indicate.  The leading cryptocurrency rose to $6,785 on Bitfinex on Wednesday – the highest level since June 22 – and looked set to test the psychological hurdle of $7,000, as suggested by Monday’s bullish breakout.  However, the bulls failed to muster enough momentum to cross $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop from $9,990 to $5,755) on a daily closing basis (as per UTC), establishing the Fibonacci level as a stiff resistance.  Further, a detailed look at the technical charts reveals the area around $6,754 is packed with moving average lines and Bollinger Band, all working in unison to put brakes on BTC price rally.  Hence, a convincing break above the resistance needs to happen soon, else a price pullback could be in the offing.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,620 on Bitfinex.  The above chart shows: Clearly, the odds are stacked in favor of a convincing move above the resistance zone of $6,717-$6,770. The bullish setup in the daily chart also favors a rally to $7,000. However, if BTC fails to pick up a bid in the next few hours, the focus will likely shift to the bearish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence seen in the 4-hour chart. In this case, the rising channel could be breached to the downside, triggering a deeper pullback in BTC prices.  Speed Bump via Shutterstock"
1," After a decent bullish wave, bitcoin lost the momentum near the USD 6,700 level. BTC/USD started a downside correction and tested a major support near USD 6,400 - USD 6,450. However, declines were protected and the price is currently trading above the USD 6,500 level. Similarly, Ethereum corrected lower and tested a key support at USD 450 before recovering higher. Overall, the current wave can be considered as a part of a correction as long as bitcoin is above USD 6,400. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price formed a high near USD 6,685 and corrected lower. It broke the USD 6,500 support and tested a crucial support at USD 6,400. The BTC/USD pair found a strong buying interest and is currently trading above the USD 6,500 level (GMT 8:30 AM).
On the upside, a break above the USD 6,600 resistance could set the pace for a push towards the USD 6,700 level, above which the price may perhaps test the USD 6,800 resistance. On the downside, the USD 6,400 support holds the key, below which, the price will most likely test USD 6,250. Ethereum
Ethereum price also corrected lower and traded a few points below the USD 460 level. ETH/USD tested the USD 450 support zone, which stopped losses. The price is currently trading with a bullish angle above the USD 460 level.
On the upside, resistances are seen near USD 470 and USD 480. Above this last, the price could test the USD 500 resistance. On the downside, the USD 455 and USD 450 levels are important supports. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price declined by more than 5% and is currently trading well below the USD 800 pivot level. BCH/USD broke the USD 780 support and is currently trading near the USD 760 support. If the price declines further, it may well test the USD 740 support.
Ripple price failed to stay above the USD 0.50 support and declined towards the USD 0.48 level. XRP/USD is currently down around 4% and is facing a tough resistance near the USD 0.49 - USD 0.50 area. Other Altcoins Market Today
Most small cap altcoins corrected lower, but there were a few coins which posted gains like SYS, MANA, SNT and STEEM. Out of these, SYS was very volatile during the past few sessions. As reported, a single SYS was sold for 96 BTC on Binance. Syscoin’s (SYS) blockchain was compromised since more than one billion coins were mined in a single block, while its supply is 888 million. It forced the exchange to temporarily close operations to perform maintenance.  Binance completed their maintenance and it could help bitcoin and altcoins in moving back higher during the coming sessions."
1," A lack of regulatory clarity has put enormous pressure on the market this year, as the G20 countries, the EU, and financial regulators in the US have all sent mixed messages about future regulations to the market, according to Tom Lee, veteran bitcoin investor and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors.  He was speaking at the 2018 Asia Blockchain Summit in Taiwan. The same sentiment has also been echoed by other industry experts, with Ryan Rabaglia of Octagon Strategy, a digital asset brokerage, recently telling CNBC that if regulations are sorted out, more and more professional and institutional players will enter the market and likely drive up prices as a result. Bitcoin charts: Secondly, Lee pointed to the futures market for bitcoin as possibly having a detrimental effect on the ‘real’ market. While Lee did not offer any reasons for why this could be the case, it is well-known that the futures market is largely controlled by banks and very large traders.  As Cryptonews.com has reported on previously, this is not the first time Lee blames the futures market for bitcoin’s misery. However, as bitcoin futures contracts are settled in cash and no physical delivery of bitcoins takes place, no direct link exists between bitcoin futures contracts and real bitcoin.  In May, the San Francisco Federal Reserve also stressed that  bitcoin’s fall from almost USD 20,000 is directly tied to the launch of a futures market.  “The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence. It is consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the introduction of futures markets for an asset,” four researchers wrote in the bank's Economic Letter in May. Bitcoin price forecast revised lower While speaking at the summit, Lee also revised his year-end price prediction for bitcoin from USD 25,000 to USD 22,000. He further explained that he believes the price of bitcoin should be at least twice the cost of mining, under normal market conditions.  UPDATED: Later, Tom Lee explained this prediction in more detail, saying that Bitcoin still can hit USD 25,000 this year.  Today, mining bitcoin is not profitable for most people, and Lee estimates the current mining cost to be around USD 9,100 per bitcoin.  Also in May, Fundstrat estimated that by the end of 2019, average price of Bitcoin could reach USD 36,000, with a USD 20,000 - USD 64,000 range. This explosion in price could happen due to crypto mining, as Fundstrat predicts a growth of 350% in hash power (the processing power of the Bitcoin network) through 2019.  Lee previously predicted a bitcoin price surge following the Consensus 2018 conference in May, which failed to materialize."
1," Bitcoin (BTC) has pulled back from an 11-day high, but the short-term outlook remains bullish, the technical studies indicate. The leading cryptocurrency looked overbought yesterday, as per short-duration indicators, having rallied to $6,681 on Bitfinex on Monday – the highest level since June 22. Consequently, BTC fell back to $6,414 earlier today and was last seen trading at $6,530 – down 2.2 percent on a 24-hour basis. Clearly, the bullish momentum has waned in the last 24 hours, still, the technical charts are biased to the bulls. Further, the probability of BTC rallying to $7,000 (psychological hurdle) remains high while prices are holding above the former resistance-turned-support of $6,341, as seen in the chart below.  BTC breached the double bottom neckline resistance of $6,341 on Saturday, confirming a short-term bullish reversal and opening doors to $6,927 (target as per the measured height method). Further, it built a nice base (marked by a circle) around $6,341 before staging a high volume rally to $6,681 on Sunday. Clearly, $6,341 is a strong support and only a break below that level would weaken the bull case. Currently, BTC is trading well above the neckline support and is looking northwards as indicated by the double bottom breakout and bull flag breakout.  The falling channel breakout and the bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving average (MA) indicate the rally from the June 24 low of $6,755 is likely to continue in the days ahead. On the way higher, BTC may encounter resistance at (June 19 high), $6,880 (upper Bollinger Band), $7,067 (50-day MA). Sniper scope via Shutterstock"
0," When sending cryptocurrency, one of the main features is the fact that addresses are long and virtually impossible to remember. Naturally, very few people are willing to type the address in by hand, instead relying on copying it from one application to another - and this is exactly where the danger lies. This type of malware is called CryptoCurrency Clipboard Hijackers monitors, as its name implies, the Windows clipboard, which is the temporary memory where the copied data goes until it is replaced by another copied thing. If this malware detects a cryptocurrency address in the clipboard - where it will inevitably be if you copy-paste it - it swaps that address out for its own. This means that the coins will go to that address when it is pasted, unless you double check it (and that is something you should certainly do). According to BleepingComputer, a sample of this type of malware monitors over 2.3 million cryptocurrency addresses. It can be very hard to protect yourself from this type of malware as it shows no indication of running in the background. This is why you should always have an up to date antivirus installed and running, make periodical scans of your system, and double check the address you’re sending your coins to. As Cryptonews.com previously reported, cybersecurity expert Lotem Finkelsteen of the Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point Software Technologies warns that cryptocurrency-related attacks will surpass all others this year. Many other security experts have also warned that crypto-related attacks will only increase, as there will be “targeted attacks on companies for the purpose of installing miners” as well as threats from cryptocurrency-related ransomware."
0," In yesterday’s outlook, we discussed the importance of the USD 6,500 resistance in bitcoin price. During the past three sessions, there were heavy bullish moves, resulting in an upside push in BTC/USD above the USD 6,500 resistance. It opened the doors for more gains and helped altcoins such as ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin and others to gain bullish momentum. The cryptocurrency market is now trading in the green zone with a lot of positive signs. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price formed a solid support above USD 6,300 and jumped above the USD 6,500 and USD 6,600 resistance levels. BTC/USD is currently (GMT 08:30 AM) trading in a tiny range below the USD 6,800 resistance, and is preparing for the next move. 
An upside break above USD 6,800 could ignite more gains towards the USD 7,000 and USD 7,200 levels. On the flip side, if the price corrects lower, the previous resistances at USD 6,600 and USD 6,500 are likely to act as supports for buyers. Ethereum
Ethereum price gained traction and moved above a crucial resistance at USD 450. ETH/USD traded above the USD 480 level and is currently consolidating gains.
An initial support on the downside is at USD 472, below which the price may test the USD 460 support. On the upside, a break above the USD 485 level could give an opening to buyers to take the price above the USD 500 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price surged higher and cleared many hurdles such as USD 750, USD 780 and USD 800. BCH/USD is currently trading with a stable bias above the USD 800 level, with an immediate resistance at USD 820 and USD 850. 
Ripple price zoomed higher and cleared the USD 0.48 and USD 0.50 resistances. XRP/USD is now trading in a bullish zone above USD 0.50. On the upside, resistances are seen near the USD 0.520 and USD 0.535 levels. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins posted heavy gains today, including WAX, Bytecoin, Ethos, MONA, ELF, LOOM, ELA, SYS, Golem, KCS, CMT, MITH and BTS. A few other coins such as Neo, ADA, Ark and NEM posted gains between 15-20%. Overall, the market sentiment was really boosted during the past three sessions. Going forward, a break above USD 7,000 in bitcoin could further accelerate gains in BTC and altcoins in the near term."
0," There are still more than 3 million people holding bitcoin in China, despite the government’s ban on trading, a researcher at theInternational Monetary Institute at Renmin University in China has estimated. The researcher named Li Honghan made the statement during a summit held in Beijing on June 29 known as the New Financial Trends and Fin-Tech Summit 2018, according to Chinese news portal Chinatimes.net.cn. While Li did not reveal his data source, it is well-known that Chinese investors are still active in the cryptocurrency space, making use of advanced censorship-resistant technologies like decentralized exchanges and peer-to-peer marketplaces to bypass government regulation. As Cryptonews.com has reported on previously, bitcoin mining has also proved difficult for regulators to crack down on in China. It is estimated that more than 50% of global bitcoin mining capacity is located in China, with the remote provinces of Qinghai and Sichuan having a particularly high concentration of bitcoin miners. The large number of miners in China has previously led Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse to attack bitcoin by claiming that it is “controlled by China.” Bitcoin has seen a surge in price and trading volume over the past few days, adding nearly 14% since June 29, according to data from Coinbase."
0," Bitcoin (BTC) is flashing green, having convincingly scaled a key technical resistance Monday, and looks set to test the $7,000 mark in the next few days. At press time, BTC is trading at $6,575 on Bitfinex – up 3.4 percent in the last 24 hours. The short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change, as indicated by BTC’s break above the significant obstacle of $6,450, will likely entice investors to bargain-hunt, creating an upward pressure on BTC prices. Hence, BTC could rise to $7,000 in the short-term and extend into further gains if its move toward the psychological hurdle is backed by a sharp rise in the trading volume. That said, the crypto asset’s 24-hour trading volume stands at $4.61 billion, according to CoinMarketCap, down 8 percent from Monday despite a bearish-to-bullish trend change.  BTC closed (as per UTC) at $6,618 on Monday, confirming a bullish falling channel breakout. Further, the 5-day and 10-day moving average (MA) is biased to the bulls (sloping upwards), having witnessed a bullish crossover over the weekend. Meanwhile, the relative strength index has moved to neutral (at 50.00) from the bearish territory (below 50.00). What’s more, the Chaikin money flow (CMF) oscillator, which measures the buying and selling pressure, has turned positive for the first time since May 20 and currently stands at the highest level since May 10. The positive print indicates the money is flowing into bitcoin and adds credence to the bullish falling channel breakout.  BTC witnessed a bull flag breakout on Monday, which signaled a continuation of the rally from Friday’s low below $5,800 and could yield a break above $7,000. Clearly, the odds are stacked in favor of a rally to $7,000, however, the move may not happen overnight, as the short-duration charts are reporting overbought conditions. For instance, the hourly chart RSI is rolling over from the overbought territory (above 70.00) as seen in the chart above. Further, the 4-hour RSI is hovering well above 70.00 (in the overbought territory). Hard hat image via Shutterstock"
1," On this past Friday, someone claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto published 21 pages of new material which they claim to an excerpt, straight out of a book about the origins of Bitcoin. The site where this was published details the “first excerpt to a literary work consisting of two parts” that claims to be “a short story if you will, with some of the most brought up questions and answers. I wanted the people and the facts to be known.” The website that the excerpt appeared on is called NakamotoFamilyFoundation.org and was anonymously purchased three days ago via Amazon’s domain registrar. Of course, the self-proclaimed Satoshi (or, as the community calls him, Faketoshi) Craig Wright immediately tweeted that the “new” Nakamoto writings were a fraud: “Nakamotofamilyfoundation cannot get the dates nor technical details correct.” In true Nakamoto style, it even includes a cryptogram, which purports to reveal names related to the title of the book. The answer seems to be honne and tatamae (or tatemae), which is a Japanese expression that describes “the contrast between a person’s true feelings and desires” and “the behavior and opinions one displays in public.” The excerpt is titled “duality” in a similar manner. The excerpt also indicates that Satoshi Nakamoto may have been, at some point at least, a group of people. “The truth is one that people will not come to expect,” Nakamoto says in the excerpt, continuing, “Because the truth is too special to give away, requires a long answer, which will be in the book.”  Strange parts of the text include one that seems to imply that there was more than one genesis block of Bitcoin, the starting point for the blockchain, as the author refers to it as the “first” genesis block. Is it real? Nobody knows for sure right now. People mentioned in the excerpt have been contacted by WIRED, and some either refuse to comment or say that nothing is verifiable proof. What remains, however, is the hope that we will find out soon enough, and maybe the mystery of the past decade will be solved. ______ A few passages from the excerpt:"
1," Bitcoin started 2018 with a spike above the USD 17,000 level. However, the price faced heavy selling interest due to regulation and exchange hack issues. As a result, a fresh round of bearish wave was initiated and BTC/USD tumbled by more than USD 10,000. In February 2018, the price formed a low around USD 6,000 and later corrected above USD 10,000. The upside move was capped by USD 12,000 and the price resumed its downtrend. During the past few months, the price traded with a bearish bias below the USD 10,000 resistance level. On the positive, there was no substantial decline below the USD 6,000 support area. Recently, the price traded towards the USD 5,650 level, but jumped back above USD 6,000. Overall, it seems like the USD 5,500 - USD 6,000 zone is a crucial support. As long as the price is above the stated support zone, it could make an attempt to recover during the coming months. A few significant resistances on the way to USD 10,000 are at USD 6,500, USD 7,500, USD 8,000 and USD 9,200. Finally, a convincing break above USD 10,000 may perhaps start a solid upward wave towards USD 12,000 and USD 15,000. On the flip side, if bitcoin fails to stay above the USD 5,500 - USD 6,000 support zone, then there could be a lot of pressure on buyers. The next supports are at USD 5,000 and USD 4,200. Meanwhile, last week, Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, an insurance giant, told CNBC that bitcoin would be a buy if the price falls below USD 5,000. El-Erian sees bitcoin emerging as more of a tradeable commodity than a currency, but doesn't expect it will get all the way back to USD 20,000. Ethereum Price Outlook Ethereum followed bitcoin and fell from well above USD 1,350 in January 2018 to USD 370 in April 2018. Later, ETH/USD corrected above USD 500 and tested the USD 800 level where it faced a crucial resistance. It declined once again and is currently trading well below the USD 500 pivot level. However, the USD 400 support zone is holding declines in Ethereum and it may perhaps continue to act as a strong support. To start a decent recovery, ETH/USD must settle above the USD 500 pivot level. Above this, the next hurdles for buyers are at USD 650 and 800. The final barrier for a larger upward wave is at USD 1,000. On the other hand, a break below the USD 400 support could push the price toward the 2018 low near USD 370. Below this last, there is an open space up to USD 250. Bitcoin Cash, Ripple and Other Altcoins Market Bitcoin cash and ripple were under heavy selling pressure during the first half of 2018. BCH/USD declined from well above USD 2,500 to USD 650 which acted as a strong support. It is currently consolidating losses and is preparing for the next move. Resistances are at USD 800, USD 1,000 and USD 1,250.  Ripple peaked around USD 3.70 in January 2018 and declined more than USD 3.00. It traded close to the USD 0.40 level and is currently in a bearish zone. Resistances are seen near USD 0.65, 0.75, 0.80 and 1.00. Above this last, XRP/USD could recover towards the USD 1.50 level. To sum up, bitcoin and altcoins declined heavily during the first half of 2018. Prices are now stable and are following a consolidation pattern. Going forward, a successful break above key resistances in bitcoin could stage a decent comeback in the coming months. Key levels to watch out are USD 6,500, USD 7,500, USD 8,000 and USD 9,200 on the upside, and USD 6,000, USD 5,500 and USD 5,000 on the downside."
1," The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently seeking public feedback on a new proposal for an exchange traded fund (ETF) backed by bitcoin. The new bitcoin ETF proposal was brought up by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) as it seeks to list a fund known as “SolidX Bitcoin Shares,” issued by VanEck, an investment management firm, according to an official SEC statement. The new fund intends to be fully backed by holding real bitcoin, as opposed to holding only bitcoin derivatives or futures contracts, as some other funds do. This could mean that a new flow of money from more traditionally minded investors and institutions can now find its way into the bitcoin market, potentially setting the stage for a new price rally. In the past, the SEC has turned down several such proposals, arguing that they have no way of ensuring a sufficient level of transparency regarding trading activity and potential price manipulation in the underlying market for bitcoin.  The SEC has also argued that they would want to have a market for bitcoin futures contracts before approving an ETF. With both the CBOE and CME Group now offering this, it is speculated that it is only a matter of time before the SEC approves the first ETF backed by bitcoin that is trading on regulated US exchanges. The approval of a publicly-traded Bitcoin ETFs would be a big deal for Bitcoin as an asset class, as ETFs are traded on exchanges in the same way as stocks. Traditional ETFs, which is a security which tracks indices, a commodity or a basket of assets, have gained substantial popularity among both institutional and retail investors as they are generally liquid and easy to buy and sell."
1," Bitcoin is building on Friday’s sharp recovery from lows below $5,800, indicating the corrective rally has more substance than what many presumed to be another “dead cat bounce.” Overall, the premier cryptocurrency jumped to $6,661.76 at 13:00 UTC, a 6.37 percent increase from the day’s low of $6,262.28, and was last seen trading at $6,613, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The broader market followed suit, as it usually does when bitcoin (BTC) flexes its muscles. Currently, the total value of all cryptocurrencies stands at $270 billion, having jumped $14 billion in the in the morning hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Looking ahead, the broader market may remain solidly bid as the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization looks set to test the $7,000 mark, courtesy of a bullish continuation price pattern, as seen in the charts below.  Having faced rejection at flag resistance in Asian hours, the cryptocurrency was expected to revisit flag support. However, BTC unexpectedly picked up a bid at $6,275, setting stage for a big move on the higher side. The subsequent bull flag breakout, as seen in the chart above, signaled a resumption of the rally from Friday’s low below $5,800, temporarily silencing the “dead cat” critics. Price action now sets scope to $7,065 (target as per the measured height method, i.e. pole height added to breakout price). What’s more, the bullish breakout is accompanied by a rise in volume. So, the gains look sustainable.  BTC cleared the falling wedge resistance on Friday, signaling a short-term bear-to-bull trend change. Further, a bullish follow-through to Sunday’s inside bar, as seen today, only validates Friday’s falling wedge breakout and indicates better times ahead for BTC. Bitcoin price image via Shutterstock"
1," Bitcoin (BTC) has regained poise over the weekend after a drop below $6,000 last week, but a short-term bullish reversal is still not confirmed. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,320 on Bitfinex – up 13 percent from the seven-month low of $5,755 hit on June 24. BTC was expected to remain on the defensive and drop to fresh 2018 lows below $5,755 over the weekend, having closed below $6,000 (February low) on Thursday. However, it unexpectedly picked up a bid at $5,780 on Friday, contradicting the bearish technical setup, and rose to $6,545 on Bitfinex on Saturday – its highest level since June 22. The bounce may be due to sellers running dry, having pushed BTC lower by 70 percent in the first six months of the year. Further, the repeated rebound from sub-$6,000  levels (February low) have established the area below the psychological mark as a significant near-term support. Still, it is too early to call a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change, as the bulls are yet to violate the series of lower price highs and lower price lows, as represented by the falling channel (bearish setup) seen in the chart below.  BTC created a bullish outside-day candle on Friday and closed (as per UTC) well above $6,302 (Friday’s high) on Saturday, confirming a bullish outside-day reversal pattern. However, the follow-through has stalled at the falling channel resistance in the last 48 hours. Hence, we remain cautious and would feel comfortable calling a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change only after BTC has crossed the falling channel hurdle in a convincing manner. That said, the probability of an aggressive move above the falling channel resistance, currently located at $6,450, looks high as the cryptocurrency has created a bull flag – a bullish continuation pattern – on the short duration chart below.  A break above the flag resistance of $6,416 would signal a continuation of the rally from the recent lows below $5,800, and would open the doors to $7,065 (target as per the measured height method, i.e. pole height added to breakout price).

1," The price of XRP slid below $0.43 on Friday, hitting a new low for 2018.  The world’s third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell to $0.424 at 13:00 UTC, surpassing the prior low of $0.438 seen just five days ago on the Bitfinex exchange. XRP has not recorded a daily close below $0.42 since December 12th, 2017. As of press time, the figure has risen above the low, back to averaging a price of $0.43. Current prices reflect a 24-hour drop of 3.5 percent and a 14 percent decline week-to-week.  . Market bears will look to strengthen their grip if the current level of $0.43 cannot hold as XRP is not accompanied by any neighboring technical support. The strongest layer of support may not be seen until $0.19. XRP is not the lone cryptocurrency to set an annual low today, however, as it is joined by the likes of OmiseGo (OMG), neo (NEO), litecoin (LTC), and zcash. The largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC), came just $14 shy of breaking its annual low of $5,786 earlier this morning, CoinDesk data further indicates. Consequently, the broader market is taking a beating. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has hit $232 billion – its lowest mark since November of 2017 and a 72 percent depreciation from all-time high just under $830 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.

1," Bitcoin (BTC) could post new 2018 lows over the weekend, having found acceptance below key price support. Despite signs of a possible corrective rally seen earlier yesterday, the leading cryptocurrency closed below $6,000 for the first time since November 12, signaling a downside break of a major support (February low). While the bears had briefly pushed prices down to $5,755 (2018 low) last Sunday, a close below $6,000 had remained elusive. Now that prices sit below $6,000, the focus is back on the long-run bearish technical charts, which continue to call a move lower to $5,000. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $5,904 on Bitfinex – down 3.4 percent on a 24-hour basis. Meanwhile, other cryptocurrencies are also flashing red this morning. Names like EOS, litecoin (LTC), cardano (ADA) are reporting 6 percent drops on a 24-hour basis. Ethereum (ETH) and XRP are down 4 percent each, according to CoinMarketCap. Despite the drop below support, bitcoin is still outperforming most other cryptocurrencies and is now at 11th place on the list of best performing top-100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Clearly, investors have become more risk-averse, venturing out of high-risk cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin (and possibly then on to fiat currency). Consequently, the BTC dominance rate has climbed to 43 percent – the highest level since April 12. Unfortunately for the bulls, the stage looks set for a further decline in bitcoin prices. Even so, the bears still need to keep their eyes open, as the unwinding of short positions ahead of month’s end and more importantly, quarter’s end, could again lift prices above $6,000.  The close below $6,000 support has bolstered the already bearish technical setup as indicated by the falling channel (series of lower highs and lower lows), downward sloping 5-day and 10-day moving average (MA). Further, bitcoin is trading well below 50-day, 100-day and 200-day MAs, indicating that the long-term bias is bearish. What’s more, the long-term averages are aligned one below the other and are trending south. The bearish sentiment is quite an obstacle to overcome right now, as the bullish price-to-relative strength index (RSI) and price-to-money flow index divergences seen earlier this week failed to yield a notable corrective rally. Other indicators are also pointing to a strong bearish sentiment. For instance, the Chaikin money flow (CMF), an oscillator that measures buying and selling pressure, is printing negative values for the fifth consecutive week. The drop below $6,000 also adds credence to the pennant breakdown seen in the weekly chart and the bearish crossover between the 5-month and 10-month moving average. Charts image via Shutterstock"
0," Speaking on CNBC yesterday, Fundstrat’s Robert Slyumer has given his opinion on the BTC charts. He believes that the current Bitcoin downtrend can only be reversed if the coin creates a short-term break, through the $6,300 mark. The Bitcoin analyst studied the Bitcoin 15-day moving average charts from May and said: “It really is a no-man’s land from a trading standpoint. I think if you’re a very short-term trader… we have a critical stop level at the $5,800-6000… with a resistance level of $6,300-6400. If it can rally through that, I think there’s a chance Bitcoin could start to turn.” A 15-day moving average chart is a good indicator of market trends and can help forecast whether market trend is positive or negative. Slyumer looked back over Bitcoin’s 15-day moving average charts going back to 2017. These charts indicated that the crypto markets have shown progressively higher lows. A “very critical support” for the coin came at the $7,000 level this year and Slyumer focused on this point as a turning point. Because Bitcoin lost this support level and equally failed to cross the $7,800 resistance threshold on the upside, it created “lower highs” and began an overall downtrend. Bitcoin is currently defending the $6,000 level and is trading below its 15-day MA trendline for late 2017, early 2018. In Slyumer’s opinion, $5,800-$6,000 is now the “absolutely critical” support level for Bitcoin. If it fails to hold then the coin will decline further to the $5,000-$5,500 range. Until we see the coin holding above this support level then the downtrend is inevitably going to continue. >>Can a Bitcoin Airdrop Help the Humanitarian Crisis in Venezuela? Tom Lee’s prediction that Bitcoin will reach $25,000 this year will be a tough rally for the coin in Slyumer’s opinion: “At this point, we’re just seeing recovery rallies back to the 15-day, back to the downtrend, and it’s failing.”  Other major investors have also made similar predictions for Bitcoin price – notably billionaire Tim Draper who thinks the coin might reach $250,000 by 2022.  For now, though, Bitcoin is currently trading just under $6,100. The coin is down 9 percent from the beginning of the week. Featured Image: DepositPhotos.com/ANDRANIK2017"
0," Can a Bitcoin Airdrop help the people of Venezuela? The country is considered one of the world’s most oppressive monetary states. Unfair practices implemented by its government to maintain control of its people has resulted in the following; “severe shortages of medicines, medical supplies, and food have intensified since 2014, and weak government responses have undermined Venezuelans’ rights to health and food. Protesters have been arbitrarily detained and subject to abuse by security forces.” — as reported by The Human Rights Watch World Report in 2017. But can cryptocurrency change all this? Developer John Wheeler is trying to make that the case. The former bank employee turned developer is working on a new project — getting Bitcoin into the hands of Venezuelan citizens. Teaming with Morgan Crena, the pair have formed a non-profit organization called the Pale Blue Foundation which is currently working to create a Bitcoin Airdrop. Through his foundation, Wheeler wants to use Bitcoin to change an economic and political crisis so severe that people can’t pay for necessities — food is in such short supply that joining lengthy food lines have become regular practice for citizens just trying to obtain the necessities. Prices for such necessities can also be exorbitant and routinely changed by the seller. There is no regulation. Wheeler and Crena’s mission involves a supporting team who are developing a mobile app called Azul. This app will hopefully draw millions of donations which will be transferred via a Bitcoin Airdrop to citizens of Venezuela. The project began as an idea batted around on Medium, but it is starting to take real shape; now, it is drawing help from Bitcoin companies including OpenBazaar and LocalBitcoins. But why Bitcoin? Crypto communities Zcash and Dash have also been long trying to help Venezuela in some way, but the team has focused on Bitcoin because they believe it to be the most widely available and resilient network with the ability to handle vast transactions. “We’re focused on bitcoin because we think it’s the most viable solution with the most worldwide potential,” Wheeler said. Bitcoin’s upcoming lightning network is also a key consideration for the technical design of the Azul App. Lightning is a layer-two technology which will solve scaling issues within the Bitcoin network, increasing transaction limits exponentially. The Pale Blue Foundation is currently in discussions with relative developers — lightning wallet developers CoinClip and the lightning startup ACINQ. With all the technicalities behind the mission on a roll and with the necessary bodies joining the fight, the team still needs to secure the funding that’ll buy the Bitcoin to be airdropped to Venezuelans. The initial hope is to secure millions of dollars from venture capitalists and donors; believers of the cause who want to join a “large-scale collaborative mission to help people suffering from financial tyranny.” >>Bank of England Warns Executives of Crypto Risk.

0," 20% of the surveyed UK millennials, a group of the population aged between 21 and 35, would rather invest in Bitcoin than in real estate, the UK-based build-to-rent developer Get Living said in its report ""Millenial Living in 2018"". ""The rollercoaster ride in value for Bitcoin has excited many millennials, with one in five seeing it as an appealing investment proposition compared with relatively slow-moving property values,"" according to the report.  The survey was conducted online with more than 3,000 millennials, living across the United Kingdom from March 28th to April 4th 2018. Therefore, even after the profound correction this year Bitcoin holds more intrigue than the prospect of steady growth in house prices.   This translates into the Bitcoin-related results: 27% of male millennials would rather go with Bitcoin, whereas the percentage of female respondents agreeing was not given. Cryptocurrencies and real estate are not quite apart. Since the young industry has already made waves in almost every business sector, real estate is no exception. Real estate venture Propy, which trades properties in cryptocurrencies on a blockchain-powered platform, has listed an historicRenaissance-era Roman mansion on its database.  Meanwhile, a survey by a banking giant ING showed that interest in cryptocurrency is expected to more than double (although they don't know when), bringing the prices up as well, as reported."
0," Seeing any cryptocurrency establish any kind of positive trend comes like a lifeline in this bearish times. Bitcoin dominance rate reached a high of 2 months yesterday, to 42.74%, and stands at 42.50% as of the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap data. The Dominance Index is an indicator that tracks the percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization contributed by the leading cryptocurrency. So, a rising dominance rate might mean the demand for Bitcoin is greater than the demand for other innovations. Percentage of total market capitalization (dominance): For example, last year, Bitcoin’s dominance rate increased from 38% to 66.5% in six months, driving its value up from USD 1,760 to nearly USD 20,000. But it must be noted that it also tends to rise during risk aversion periods, when investors move out of high-risk alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin, and then possibly on to fiat currency. Possibly, it would seem that risk aversion is to blame for this dominance rate rising this time, given how much the prices have fallen. A lot of investors seem to prefer cash over any of the cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin included. However, if prices start to rise along with Bitcoin’s dominance rate, it may mean that the cryptocurrencies markets have bottomed out. But the rising of the Bitcoin dominance rate also means that we still have time until the Flippening. It is a possible future event when Ethereum overtakes Bitcoin to become the most valuable cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization. The community argues that, with the fact that Bitcoin’s strongest claim to glory is first to market dominance, the Flippening is only a matter of time."
0," Hotel and airline ticket booking giant Expedia has confirmed that they have removed the bitcoin payment option from their website, according to media reports. The service was deactivated on June 10, according to a spokesperson for the online booking platform. The spokesperson did not offer any further comments as to why the company chose to remove the option. Members of the crypto community immediately took to Reddit to voice their frustration, with some suggesting switching over to more crypto-friendly booking sites such as CheapAir, which has accepted bitcoin since 2013. Some also noted that many employees in the IT and blockchain industry receive their salaries in bitcoin, and that Expedia now risks losing business from this customer segment. “[…] Customer support said they stopped accepting it June 10… A lot of us in the tech industry get a portion of our salary in Bitcoin and it was really good to use Expedia for flights. I won’t be using them anymore,” a Reddit user wrote. Expedia first started accepting payments in bitcoin back in 2014 as part of a partnership with the Coinbase exchange. With the sudden suspension of the service, some now speculate that Expedia acted in response to Coinbase suspending its custodial service for businesses. Without a reliable custodial solution, merchants working with Coinbase may find difficulties in continuing to process payments in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, after the social media platform Reddit ditched bitcoin as a payment option in March due to transaction fees and an integration issue with Coinbase, the platform is considering to reintroduce cryptocurrency payments, Cheddar reported in May. .@Reddit, which hosts communities for every single cryptocurrency in the world, is hoping to bring back crypto payments to the platform, this time with Ethereum and Litecoin in addition to Bitcoin, according to CTO @KeyserSosa. pic.twitter.com/wkUniMvhex"
0," Bitcoin’s (BTC) price charts remain biased to the bears, but market positioning on a major exchange suggests a sustained break below $6,000 may remain elusive in short-term. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,100 on Bitfinex, largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis, and technically speaking, BTC remains on the defensive as discussed yesterday. Further, the cryptocurrency markets will likely remain risk averse as the sell-off in ETH/BTC – the risk barometer of the cryptocurrency markets – is seen gathering pace in the next 24 hours. So, going by the technicals alone, it seems safe to say that BTC is likely to find acceptance below the February low of $6,000 soon. However, activity on Bitfinex, the fourth biggest cryptocurrency exchange by 24-hour trading volume, shows that BTC/USD shorts have been getting liquidated in recent days, while investors have been loading up on BTC/USD longs, creating upward pressure on price. Thus, there is merit in the bears being cautious, as a corrective rally can’t be ruled out.  The falling channel and downward sloping Bollinger Bands (standard deviation of +2, -2 on 20-day moving average) indicate that the bear grip on bitcoin is still intact. The Chaikin money flow (CMF), an oscillator that measures buying and selling pressure, remains below zero, indicating strong selling pressure. The longer the CMF remains the remains in a zone (either above zero or below zero) the more consistent the sentiment. In BTC’s case, bearish sentiment is quite strong as the CMF has been hovering in the negative territory for the fifth consecutive week. BTC could well close (as per UTC) below $6,000 (February low) in the next day or two, and maybe extend the decline from the May high of $9,990 towards $5,000 in the next few weeks.  As mentioned above, BTC/USD longs on Bitfinex have increased by 16.5 percent since June 17, as seen in the chart above. This likely indicates that bargain hunters are finding BTC undervalued around $6,000 – unsurprising, perhaps, as the cryptocurrency is down 70 percent from the all-time record high of almost $20,000 in December.  BTC/USD shorts have dropped 25 percent since Sunday. Interestingly, the charts saw a long-legged doji candle on the same day, indicating bearish exhaustion. Both are factors that may have helped BTC’s defense of $6,000 amid the bearish technical setup. Bitcoin image via Shutterstock"
1," The value of Bitcoin may be manipulated by public sentiment from social media, new research shows. A four-university team, led by professor Feng Mai of Stevens School of Business, found that not only do comments influence the price, but some commenters can even carry up to ten times the weight of others. Professor Feng Mai was working with University of Cincinnati, Dickinson College and Ivey Business School, collecting two years’ worth of posts from the Bitcointalk forum, as well as two months’ worth of data from Twitter.  “Any changes in Bitcoin's price are obviously going to affect the sentiment around it, so we needed to factor in those influences as well,” Mai was quoted as saying on the website of Stevens School of Business. The results of this research were recently published in the Journal of Management Information Systems, and show that “periods of increasingly positive social media commentary do in fact influence the rising price of Bitcoin significantly.” But the voice of those who do not regularly talk about Bitcoin, instead taking the time to comment infrequently, is what is actually moving the price. On the other hand, users who are very active did not move Bitcoin's price much at all. “This was a big finding, and it does seem to prove that people are trusting the silent majority much more, perhaps because they do not seem to have an agenda,” Mai said for the Stevens article, adding, “It's also true that, by following the infrequent posters' comments, you get a much more accurate prediction of Bitcoin's price over time, and this is useful for investors and potential investors to know.” The team hopes to investigate blockchain technology and its relationship with social media soon as well. Meanwhile, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has already urged customers to avoid buying tokens based on tips shared on social media. Moreover, anyone who promotes an initial coin offering (ICO) in exchange for compensation tied to the sale may be breaking the law if they don’t first register with the regulator, Richard Levin, Denver-based chair of fintech and regulation practice at law firm Polsinelli PC, told Bloomberg in a recent interview. Also, as reported, John McAfee, a self proclaimed “crypto visionary” and software tycoon, said he will stop recommending ICOs because of unspecified “threats” from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission."
1," Yesterday, we discussed that bitcoin price must break the USD 6,250 and USD 6,300 resistance levels. BTC/USD failed to move above the mentioned resistances and it is currently at a risk of more losses below the USD 6,000 support. Similarly, all major altcoins like ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash are under pressure and they could accelerate declines in the near term if buyers don’t show up. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently trading near the USD 6,050 (GMT 08:45 AM) level with an immediate support at USD 6,000. Should there be a downside break below USD 6,000, there could be heavy declines during the following sessions. The next supports are USD 5,800 and USD 5,750.
Alternatively, if bitcoin buyers take a stand and push the price above USD 6,250, there are chances of an extended recovery towards the USD 6,400 level. Ethereum
Ethereum price struggled to move above the USD 450 resistance and is currently down more than 4%. An initial support is near the USD 430 level, below which, there is a risk of further losses towards the USD 420 level.
If the price starts a recovery, it could face heavy offers near USD 450. A break above USD 450 - USD 460 is needed to initiate a decent upward recovery. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash tumbled and failed to stay above the USD 720 and USD 700 support levels. It is currently down around 6% with an immediate support at USD 680. Below this, BCH/USD may perhaps decline back towards the USD 650 support area. Resistance are seen at USD 720 and USD 740.
Ripple price is holding the USD 0.45 support, but it is at a risk of more declines. A break below USD 0.45 and USD 0.44 may well clear the path for a test of USD 0.40. Resistances are at USD 0.475 and USD 0.50. Other Altcoins Market Today
Most small cap altcoins were down today, including EOS, litecoin, stellar, cardano, IOTA, tron, XMR, neo and dash. The market sentiment is currently bearish with many signs of extended losses. It seems like bitcoin and altcoins are struggling to recover above key resistance levels. If they continue to fail, there is a risk of more declines in BTC, ETH, BCH, XRP and other cryptocurrencies."
1," Bitcoin’s share of the cryptocurrency market hit a 2.5-month high today – a sign that investors are likely switching their money from alternatives into the industry’s most widely traded asset. As tracked by CoinMarketCap, the gauge rose to 42.74 percent earlier on Wednesday, the highest level since April 14, and was last seen a tad lower at 42.5 percent. The Dominance Index is an indicator that tracks the percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization contributed by the leading cryptocurrency. So, a rising dominance rate essentially means the demand for bitcoin is greater than the demand for other innovations.  A flow toward bitcoin is usually seen at the start of the bull run, as it’s a common route for fiat money to enter the cryptocurrency market. For instance, BTC’s dominance rate rose from 38 percent to 66.5 percent in the six months to December 2017 – a time in which the cryptocurrency rallied from $1,760 to $20,000. However, it also tends to rise during periods of risk aversion – when investors move out of high-risk alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin, and then possibly on to fiat currency. And it’s the latter scenario that we likely are witnessing currently. In the last seven weeks, BTC has crashed from $9,990 to $5,755 and still, the BTC dominance rate has gone from 35.78 percent to 42.75 percent. So, the writing on the wall is clear: right now, a lot of investors prefer cash over any of the cryptocurrencies, bitcoin included. If prices start to rally along with the BTC dominance rate, however, it could mean the crypto markets have bottomed out, finally finding a floor after months of decline.

1," After a drop yesterday, bitcoin (BTC) risks another move below $6,000 in the next 24 hours, but it will still likely fare better than other cryptocurrencies. On Tuesday, bitcoin closed (as per UTC) below the immediate support of $6,108 (June 13 low), pouring cold water over the prospects of a corrective rally above a major technical hurdle at $6,425 (April 1 low). The failure to capitalize on early signs of short-term bullish reversal has shifted risk in favor of a break below the $6,000 mark (February low). Even if a drop in prices is seen, bitcoin could still outperform other cryptocurrencies, as a break below $6,000 could trigger risk aversion in the markets, forcing investors to venture out of high-risk alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin. At press time, BTC is trading at $6,100 on Bitfinex – down 2.25 percent on a 24-hour basis.  BTC was expected to scale April 1 low of 6,425 this week, courtesy of the bullish price-relative strength index (RSI) and bullish price-money flow index (MFI) divergence and the long-legged doji. Instead, it created another lower high (bearish pattern) on the chart as it fell from $6,341 (June 25 high) to $6,020 (today’s low). Further, BTC closed (as per UTC) below the immediate support of $6,108 (June 13 low) yesterday, putting the focus back on the broader bearish outlook, as indicated by the falling channel and downward sloping Bollinger Bands (+2,-2 standard deviation on the 20-day moving average). So, BTC could drop below $6,000 in the next 24 hours. On the downside, immediate support is lined up at $5,755 (Sunday’s doji candle low) and $5,717 (lower Bollinger Band). Should prices take a positive turn, immediate resistance is located at $6,341 (June 25 high) and $6,560 (20-day MA). Clearly, BTC chart is biased to the bears, however, other cryptocurrencies will likely post bigger losses, as indicated by a bearish breakdown in ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) exchange rate. The fiat money tends to flow into cryptocurrency markets via major assets like BTC and is then rotated into alternative cryptocurrencies once the bitcoin valuations look overstretched. Further, the rotation of money from bitcoin and into alternative cryptocurrencies is usually a sign the investors are eager to take more risk (a “risk-on” market). On the contrary, rotation of money out of alternative cryptocurrencies and into major assets like BTC happens when investors turn risk-averse (“risk-off” market). As most alternative cryptocurrencies are built on the ethereum blockchain, the ETH/BTC serves as a good indicator of risk-on/risk-off sentiment, i.e. rising ETH/BTC means risk-on and falling ETH/BTC means risk-off. Accordingly, the bearish breakdown seen in the chart below indicates that risk aversion will likely increase in the short-run and the alternative cryptocurrencies will post bigger drops than bitcoin.  The above chart (prices as per Bittrex) shows a bearish Bollinger Band breakdown and a downside break of the trading range. So, ETH/BTC could be heading lower towards 0.0655BTC (Aug. 15, 2017 low).

0," The past few sessions were mostly positive considering bitcoin price moved above the USD 5,750 resistance. BTC/USD even crawled above the USD 6,000 pivot level to move into a short-term uptrend. However, it is facing a significant resistance near USD 6,250 - USD 6,300. Similarly, major altcoins like Ethereum posted intraday gains, but they failed to gain momentum above crucial resistances. Going forward, the market must gain traction to break important barriers and accelerate upsides. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently (GMT 08:40 AM) trading flat near the USD 6,200 level with an immediate resistance at USD 6,250. However, the most important resistance awaits near USD 6,300. Above this last, BTC/USD will most likely stage further recoveries above USD 6,500.
On the flip side, if the price fails to move above USD 6,300, there could be a retest of USD 6,000. Any further declines could push the price back in a downtrend. Ethereum
Ethereum price tested the USD 465 - USD 470 resistance zone and faced a strong selling interest. ETH/USD moved down and is currently trading above the USD 450 support.
Should there be a downside break below USD 450, the price may perhaps decline back towards the USD 420 low. To the topside, resistances are seen at USD 465, USD 470 and USD 480. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price recovered above the USD 750 level and tested the USD 780 resistance. BCH/USD failed to move above USD 780 and declined back towards USD 740. An immediate support is at USD 725, followed by the all-important USD 700.
Ripple price also tested a crucial resistance near USD 0.50, which was a support earlier. XRP/USD failed to gain traction above USD 0.50 and is currently trading above the USD 0.4750 support. Supports on the downside are at USD 0.46 and USD 0.45. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins jumped during the past two sessions. A few coins like THETA, Cortex and Populous gained heavy traction and traded higher between 20%-25%. GNT and CENNZ also posted decent gains today and climbed by 13% and 9% respectively. Overall, there are a few positive signs on charts, but bitcoin price must break the USD 6,300 resistance to extend the current upside. Otherwise, there is a risk of a downside break below USD 6,000 in the near term."
0," Cryptocurrencies have always been the target of speculation and skepticism: from great economists expressing their disbelief in them, to Warren Buffett calling it rat poison squared, the space has not had much rest since its inception. Today, it would seem that the short-term prospects look much worse than the long-term.   While a venture capitalist predicts further drop in the crypto market, Andreessen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley investment powerhouse, has launched a USD 300 million fund focused on the nascent industry. In addition, a survey by a banking giant ING showed that interest in cryptocurrency is expected to more than double (although they don't know when), bringing the prices up as well. The bad news comes first. Spencer Bogart, a blockchain venture capitalist, a partner at Blockchain Capital, told CNBC that he’s “super-bullish on crypto right now” but also believes that the prices will go even lower. A year ago, crypto hedge funds were being formed left and right, and he believes that now, many of these funds are “hitting their one-year lock up.” This could mean people are looking to sell and get out of the space before the prices fall even lower, which would artificially bring them down anyway. And now, the good news. Andreessen Horowitz has announced that the fund is designed to include the best features of traditional venture capital, updated to the modern crypto world. Named a16z crypto, the venture fund will invest in crypto companies and protocols and will be able to hold investments for 10+ years and in all conditions, regardless of coin prices, according to Chris Dixon, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz.  ""We are long-term, patient investors. We’ve been investing in crypto assets for 5+ years. We’ve never sold any of those investments, and don’t plan to any time soon,"" he added.  The fund, co-led by a new general partner at the venture firm Katie Haun, is focused on non-speculative use case, where the value of crypto tokens is driven by the underlying, practical uses cases. ""Although the Bitcoin whitepaper is now almost 10 years old, we believe we are still early in the crypto movement. The infrastructure needs to be improved and the applications are difficult for non-early adopters to use. Many crypto applications still get dismissed as toys. We believe this will change quickly. For one, crypto is purely a software movement and doesn’t depend on a hardware buildout, in contrast to, say, the internet, which required laying cables and building cell towers. Second, the space is developing extremely rapidly, partly because the code, data, and knowledge is largely open source, and partly because of the increasing inflow of talent,"" Dixon continues.  Meanwhile, the survey by ING might support his vision. Surveying nearly 15,000 people across 13 countries the bank said that fewer than one in 10 Europeans currently own cryptocurrency, but that 16% of respondents expect to own it in the future. Most surprisingly, 15% of them said they would be open to receiving their salary in cryptocurrency. More than a third of participants believe cryptocurrency is the future of spending online. ""Cryptocurrency remains an abstract investment for many, but there may be more appetite for digital currencies than some might suggest,"" said Jessica Exton, a behavioural scientist at ING, Independent reported. If cryptocurrency stabilises there may be increased interest, she added."
0," Tether, the company behind the controversial, yet all-important cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar, on Monday issued USD 250 million in new USDT tokens.  New Tether tokens being issued means more money is making its way into the cryptocurrency market, which could help set the stage for a price comeback in a market that has seen heavy selling over the past two months. The 250 million new tokens released on Monday marks the first significant issuance of Tether tokens since May 18, when the company also released 250 million tokens. Back then, bitcoin rose by about USD 400 in the days that followed before it sold off heavily again a few days later. If history repeats itself, we therefore may see another bitcoin rally following this most recent issuance. Bitcoin price chart: Tether has received its share of criticism from members of the cryptocurrency community over a lack of transparency in the way it issues new Tether tokens. While the company says each token in circulation is backed by USD 1 in their bank account, they have failed to provide conclusive evidence to back up their claim. Earlier in June, Tether announced that they had passed a solvency test by law firm Freeh Sporkin & Sullivan LLP. Although the test didn’t meet the criteria of a formal audit, the law firm stated that it was “confident that Tether’s unencumbered assets exceed the balance of fully-backed USD Tethers in circulation as of June 1st, 2018.” As of press time, bitcoin traded nearly unchanged for the day, well above the USD 6,000 mark. Shortly after the release of the new tokens, Litecoin creator Charlie Lee shared his optimistic view on Twitter: Generally, this has been a precursor of price going up. Tether gets printed when people deposit USD and get USDT back. This USDT will then be used to buy crypto. This is similar to someone depositing $250MM to exchanges. Of course, that doesn't mean they will buy right away. DYOR https://t.co/zg2PEjGohv"
0," Bitcoin (BTC) narrowly missed scaling a key resistance level on Monday, but remains on the hunt for a corrective rally, the technical studies indicate. The cryptocurrency flashed signs of bearish exhaustion yesterday, having defended the $6,000 mark over the weekend. As discussed, a close (as per UTC) above $6,250 (Doji candle high) yesterday would have likely set the tone for a stronger corrective rally. While prices did reach a high of $6,341 yesterday, BTC closed (as per UTC) at $6,247. So, technically speaking, the short-term bull doji reversal is yet to be confirmed. However, a rally may still be on the cards, as prices are holding well above the key support of $6,000 (February low) and the indicators have diverged in favor of the bulls. On the other hand, stiff resistance lined up in the $6,400–$6,800 range could complicate the recovery. At press time, BTC is trading at $6,220 on Bitfinex, having clocked a high of $6,281 earlier today.  Although BTC failed to close above $6,250 yesterday, the green candle has established a bullish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence (lower lows in price and higher lows in the RSI). Meanwhile, the money flow index (MFI) – a momentum indicator that incorporates both price and volume into its calculations – has also created a higher low as opposed to lower lows in price (bullish divergence). The MFI is rising too, indicating an increase in buying pressure. Clearly, the indicators are aligned in favor of a corrective rally in the short-term. That said, the bulls face an uphill task as a number of key resistance hurdles await: Still, the longer outlook remains bearish, with bitcoin still trading in a falling channel. Below $6,000 (February low), major support levels are located at: So, there is a lot of room to the downside and plenty resistance to the upside, and the bulls’ task doesn’t look an easy one. BTC remains on the hunt for a corrective rally to $6,680 (falling channel hurdle). A daily close (as per UTC) above that level would confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and would open the doors to the 50-day moving average, currently located at $7,464. On the downside, a close below $6,000 (February low) would put the focus back on the long-term bearish technicals and boost odds of a drop toward $5,40 (November low). Hurdles image via Shutterstock"
1," A new Bitcoin ranking has been released, and the BTC position might surprise you. Don’t worry, it’s overall placement is still number one by market cap, but China released a new listing of its top blockchains and Bitcoin didn’t fare so well. Spoiler alert – Bitcoin didn’t even make the top ten. The China Electronic Information Industry Development (CCID) body initially released its blockchain rankings list in May. On the original list, Bitcoin (BTC) hadn’t made it into the top ten either, but it was close, coming in at lucky number 13 (the original list gave a three-way tie between Bitcoin, Verge [XVG], and Waves). Unfortunately for Bitcoin, when the CCID updated its blockchain rankings, the Bitcoin ranking was pushed back even farther. In China, Bitcoin is now ranked as the 17th best blockchain, hardly a gold star rating. (Verge moved down as well – to number 20 – but Waves actually moved up to number 11.) A lot of different factors need to be considered when attempting to rank blockchains, making the process no easy feat. Blockchain networks can be vastly different, with different elements and different goals that need to be considered, so it can be a bit tricky to compare blockchains. Certain blockchains are so different from one another that it would be silly to compare them. Among the most important things to consider when judging a blockchain network include its smart contracts, token, security, scalability, and more. Really, it’s a lot of stuff to mishmash together to come up with a ranking, and when thinking in terms other than market cap, blockchain rankings will no doubt vary considerably depending on who’s doing the ranking and what factors they are judging. China’s ranking took into consideration technology, application, and innovation, which is a pretty fair breakdown, but there’s still no information on how exactly the CCID judged the blockchains. Bitcoin was given a 41.6 for technology, 14.9 for applicability, and 35 for innovation. Its overall index from the CCID was 91.5.

1," Jack Ma Bitcoin Bubble: Yet another well-known figure has come forward to express his thoughts on the cryptocurrency sector. The figure, who is Jack Ma, spoke specifically of Bitcoin (BTC) — and his thoughts weren’t exactly in favor of the cryptocurrency. On Monday, Jack Ma, a Chinese billionaire and the founder of Alibaba Group Holding, spoke at an event held by Ant Financial Services Group, a financial affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding. During his presentation, Jack Ma spoke of both cryptocurrency and blockchain. While he praised the latter, he had a few things to say about cryptocurrencies – specifically Bitcoin. According to Mr. Jack Ma, a Bitcoin bubble looms over us. This is not the first time the Alibaba Group Holding founder has expressed these thoughts. In the past, he has warned investors over the volatile crypto sector. The comments of a Bitcoin bubble come one day after BTC set a 2018 low. Right now, Bitcoin is selling for $6,317. This puts the coin up 6.46% in the past twenty-four hours. On the whole, Jack Ma didn’t call Bitcoin a bad thing. He provided the crowd at the Ant Financial event with reasons as to why Bitcoin has potential, but also why it is failing. As for the negatives, Jack Ma said Bitcoin itself is driven by speculation. For these reasons, the billionaire vowed to avoid the asset class. However, Jack Ma did have a few optimistic things to say on the topic of Bitcoin. The virtual currency itself may be sketchy at times, but according to the e-commerce giant, the blockchain technology behind BTC should be used to solve real-world problems. Blockchain – to Jack Ma and many others –  is the real winner. So is it fair to say that Jack Ma is team blockchain? I would say so. The comments of blockchain’s revolutionary potential come on the same day that Ant Financial (Ma’s affiliate) launched money transfers between Hong Kong and the Philippines. These transfers were entirely blockchain-based. Do you agree with Jack Ma? Is the Bitcoin bubble real?  Moreover, how do you feel about the newly launched blockchain-based money transfers? Is blockchain really the solution to real-life problems? Let us know in the comments below! >> EOS and Litecoin (LTC): Good News for Everyone Featured Image: Depositphotos/© MarkoAliaksandr"
1," The founder and chairman of a China's giant Alibaba Group, one of the Chinas' richest men, Jack Ma, has declared Bitcoin a bubble once again, just as his Ant Financial launched blockchain-based money transfers between Hong Kong and the Philippines today.  This service, designed to compete with banks and traditional remittance services, is currently available only for transfers between Hong Kong and the Philippines, according to Ant Financial.  The billionaire said he wants to make it possible for people to remit even 1 cent at almost no cost, compared with the high fees charged by traditional remittances services like MoneyGram, which Ant tried to buy last year. “Due to reasons from the US our deal with MoneyGram did not succeed, so I said, ‘Let’s make one better [than MoneyGram]’ that uses the most advanced technology,” Ma said at the launch in Hong Kong, adding that the impact of blockchain on people and society will be “greater than we can ever imagine,” according to the report in the South China Morning Post, which is owned by Alibaba. “Bitcoin, however, could be a bubble,” he added, Bloomberg reports. “Blockchain should not be a tech to get rich overnight […] There are still 1.7 billion people in the world who have no bank accounts, but most of them have mobile phones.”  This is not the first time Ma expressed his skepticism towards the cryptocurrency. “Blockchain is not a bubble, but Bitcoin is,” is his opinion, as he shared it multiple times. “It’s just not for me,” remains his opinion, first said in December 2017. Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba’s backed by some of the biggest names in global finance and investment, has explored blockchain technology for years.  Now, users of AlipayHK - the Hong Kong version of Ant’s Alipay wallet - should be able to transfer money within seconds to users of GCash. The first three months are a trial period during which transaction fees will be waived. The disadvantages of traditional remittance outlets include long waiting times, lack of transparency, high transaction costs, and unfavourable exchange rates.  This is among the problems for Filipinos working overseas, for whom sending money to their families’ GCash mobile wallets will “soon be the norm,” says Anthony Thomas, president of Mynt, the operator of GCash. Eric Jing, chief executive of Ant Financial, said in a statement, “This is a new starting point and significant step forward in accelerating Alipay’s pace to promote tech for good and financial inclusion globally.” A banking giant Standard Chartered will act as the settlement bank for both AlipayHK and GCash for the blockchain transactions Hong Kong financial technology company TNG Wallet already provides mobile remittances via digital wallets, but it does not use blockchain."
1," Bitcoin price declined further during the weekend and broke the USD 6,000 support. BTC/USD traded towards the USD 5,600 level, found support, and later started an upward correction. The price is back above the USD 6,000 level, but buyers are facing many challenges to the topside. Similarly, major altcoins like ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash are showing signs of a recovery, but are facing crucial resistances. Going forward, there could be more recoveries in bitcoin, ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash if they succeed in surpassing the USD 6,500, USD 485, USD 0.50, and USD 800 resistances respectively. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently up more than 5% to USD 6,140 (GMT 08:45 AM). BTC/USD may continue to grind higher if it manages to break the USD 6,250 barrier, which is a crucial pivot zone. Above this, the next major hurdle for more upsides is at USD 6,500.
On the other hand, if bitcoin fails to move above USD 6,250, there could be another bearish reaction. An initial support is at USD 6,000, followed by USD 6,850. Below this last, the price may perhaps trade to a new low below USD 5,600. Ethereum
Ethereum tumbled further and it almost tested the USD 400 handle. ETH/USD traded near USD 420 before recovering back above USD 440. The pair is currently facing resistances near USD 450 and USD 460.
However, the most important hurdle for buyers is at USD 485, above which, the price may stage a decent correction above the USD 500 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price struggled a lot this past week and settled below USD 800. It even broke the USD 700 support before buyers appeared. Weekly resistances are at USD 780, USD 800 and USD 850. Supports are seen near USD 720, USD 700 and USD 650.
Ripple settled below a crucial support at USD 0.50. It is currently correcting higher, but is facing resistances at USD 0.48 and USD 0.49 before USD 0.50. XRP/USD must move back above USD 0.50 to recover further. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins declined heavily during the weekend. Today, a few got traction and jumped by more than 20% like WICC, Cortex, THETA and ONT. A few other coins like LOOM, CMT, XMR, ETC and DROP also traded higher and posted gains between 8-15%. To sum up, the market is showing signs of a decent comeback, but bitcoin price must break the USD 6,500 resistance. If not, the crypto market could resume its slide after completing the current correction."
1," Bitcoin (BTC) is again trading above $6,000 and looking up, but today’s closing price will likely set the tone for the rest of the week. The leading cryptocurrency fell to $5,755 at 15:00 UTC on Sunday – the lowest level since Nov. 12 – only to make a quick recovery back above $6,000 an hour later, according to Bitfinex data. The failure to capitalize on the drop, despite the long-run bearish technical setup, suggests that the bears are feeling exhausted, having pushed BTC lower by more than 40 percent (from $9,990 to $6,000) in the last seven weeks. So, a relief rally may be in the offing, but that depends on whether prices close today (as per UTC) on a positive note. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,150 – up 4.5 percent on a 24-hour basis.  BTC created a doji candle on Sunday, normally signaling indecision in the marketplace. However, when viewed against the backdrop of a 40 percent decline from May high of $9,990, Sunday’s doji candle likely represents bearish exhaustion. A notable relief rally could be in the offing if BTC closes today (as per UTC) above $6,250 (Sunday’s doji candle high), confirming a bullish doji reversal. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has begun to diverge in favor of the bulls: creating a higher low despite a lower low in price. So, a positive price action today would also confirm a bullish divergence there. A confirmation of bullish doji reversal and bullish price-RSI divergence would improve the odds of a falling channel breakout. While the short-term outlook stays bearish while BTC is stuck inside the falling channel (bearish pattern), the short duration chart does favor a relief rally in bitcoin.  The bullish price-RSI divergence only adds credence to Sunday’s doji candle and suggests BTC will likely close today above $6,250 today, confirming a bullish doji reversal.

1," That kid you know who’s now driving a Lambo because he traded something called dogecoin? He has more in common with Japanese rice traders from the 1700s than you might think.  Besides the ability to brag about their newfound riches, both traders likely analyzed price action and investor emotions by using the candlestick charting style.  Although modernized in the late 1800s by journalist Charles Dow, the core principles of candlestick charting remain intact today. Both the modern and historical technical analysts who swear by the style regard price action as more important than earnings, news or any other fundamental principles.  In other words, all known information is reflected in the price, which is precisely displayed in the candlestick. A candlestick represents the price activity of an asset during a specified timeframe through the use of four main components: the open, close, high and low.  The “open” of a candlestick represents the price of an asset when the trading period begins whereas the “close” represents the price when the period has concluded. The “high” and the “low” represent the highest and lowest prices achieved during the same trading session.  Every candlestick uses two physical features to display the four main components.  Cryptocurrency traders tend to take advantage of the inherent market volatility by using charts on the intra-day time frames. Each candlestick typically represents one, two, four or 12 hours. (A longer-term trader will likely choose to observe candlesticks that represent a single day, week or month.) A candlestick becomes “bullish,” typically green, when the current or closing price rises above its opening price. The candlestick becomes “bearish,” typically red, when its current or closing price falls below the opening price.  A candlestick rarely keeps its figure for too long in the volatile cryptocurrency market. For instance, if the 2-hour candlestick opens at a price of $10 and jumps to $13 an hour later, the shape of the candlestick will have drastically changed since opening. But traders have also come to realize the same candlestick shapes occur at the same stage of a price trend, no matter what is being traded. It can be very lucrative to identify such formations because they can expose clues as to when a trend might reverse, continue or when market indecision is at its peak. Three of the most useful candlesticks for identifying a potential trend change or for gauging market sentiment are the “doji,” “hammer” and “shooting star.” The doji is a prime example of what traders mean when they say a candlestick represents human emotion or market sentiment. When the asset price swings in both directions before closing near its opening price, it is clear the market is indecisive about the asset’s true value.The classic doji candle representing an indecisive market comprises equal-length wicks and a very thin, centrally located body. Further, there are several variations of doji, which signal trend exhaustion/trend reversal.  A hammer is the precursor to a potential downtrend reversal and can be a big money maker for the bulls. Hammers are formed when price sinks below the open only to later return and then close above the open. Such price action signifies that at one point during the trading period sellers temporarily gained control but quickly gave it back and then some, for a bullish close to the candlestick.The physical features of a hammer consist of only one wick roughly two times the length of the body which is located at the top of the candle.  Last but not least, the shooting star is the exact opposite of the hammer.  The shooting star occurs at the peak of an uptrend when the bulls rally to start the trading period, but eventually lose control to the bears who drag prices to a close below the open.It’s important to keep in mind that the longer the duration of the candlestick, the more powerful its effect is on the overarching trend.  For instance, a hammer spotted in a one-hour candlestick will have almost no impact on a 6-month long downtrend, whereas if the hammer formed on a 1-week long candlestick, its reversal impact would be much more significant.

0," Infamous, and now defunct, cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox has begun the process for a civil rehabilitation, as bankruptcy proceedings are put on hold. Announced on Friday by their trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi, the exchange has just today been awarded permission for this act by the Tokyo District Court, whereas the petition was filed in November 2017. ""Accordingly, enormous assets, which were to be distributed to Mt. Gox’s shareholders under the bankruptcy proceedings, will be returned to creditors of Mt.Gox in civil rehabilitation proceedings. This is the creditors’ victory,"" a group of claimants who had established Mt. Gox Creditors lobby group reacted to the announcement.  They add that ""However, this victory has not been realized yet. The victory will come to creditors when Mt. Gox makes payment to creditors and creditors actually receive such payment."" According to various estimations, as the process moves forward, those who lost funds in what become one of the world’s most famous hacks in history could expect to see their money sometime in the next year.  Also, according to Kobayashi, claims seeking a refund of Bitcoins will not be converted into monetary claims, meaning, that creditors who were affected and wanted to be repaid in Bitcoin may receive larger amounts of cash than those who opted for a payback in fiat. Moreover, it is estimated that Mt. Gox's bitcoin holdings will not need to be sold. Earlier this year, Kobayashi was accused of bringing down the price of the cryptocurrency in February.  However, answering to the question ""Are there future plans to sell Bitcoins and Bitcoin cash?"", Kobayashi explained that ""at present, nothing has been determined.""   Kobayashi will report on the exchange’s assets at a creditors’ meeting on September 26th in Tokyo. After that, all claimants will have until October 22nd to submit their claims. Whereas proofs of rehabilitation claims are going to be examined from January 31, 2019, to February 7, 2019, and submission deadline for proposed rehabilitation plan is February 14, 2019. Launched in July 2010, by 2013 and into 2014 Mt. Gox was handling over 70% of all bitcoin transactions worldwide, as the largest bitcoin intermediary and the world's leading bitcoin exchange, according to Wikipedia. Mt. Gox announced that approximately 850,000 bitcoins belonging to customers and the company were missing and likely stolen, an amount valued at more than USD 450 million at the time. Although 200,000 bitcoins have since been ""found"", the reason(s) for the disappearance—theft, fraud, mismanagement, or a combination of these—were initially unclear. New evidence presented in April 2015 by Tokyo security company WizSec led them to conclude that ""most or all of the missing bitcoins were stolen straight out of the Mt. Gox hot wallet over time, beginning in late 2011."""
0," Yesterday, we discussed that bitcoin price must break the USD 6,800 resistance and if it fails, there is a risk of a bearish reaction. BTC/USD struggled to clear the stated resistance, declined sharply, and broke important supports such as USD 6,700 and USD 6,600. Similarly, ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash declined heavily and moved into a bearish zone.  Overall, it seems like buyers struggled to hold gains in bitcoin and altcoins, suggesting more weakness in the near term. According to Bloomberg, Bitcoin is on its strongest negative trend since the sell-off earlier this year and charts are signaling more losses. Going forward, if bitcoin price fails to recover and drops below USD 6,200, it could decline to new 2018 lows.  Bitcoin
Bitcoin price faced an increased selling interest after it failed to surpass a major resistance at USD 6,800. BTC/USD declined and tested the USD 6,500 support zone, down more than 3.5%.
If it continues to move down, it could even break the USD 6,400 support and test USD 6,200. On the upside, resistances are seen at USD 6,600 and USD 6,700. Ethereum
Ethereum price dropped by more than 7% and broke the USD 515 and USD 500 support levels. On the downside, the next supports are at USD 490 and USD 485. Below this last, ETH/USD may perhaps trade towards USD 460. 
On the upside, there are many resistances, starting with USD 520 up to USD 540. Any further gains depend on the market sentiment in the near term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price declined heavily and broke the USD 860 and USD 850 support levels. BCH/USD is down more than 8% and is testing the USD 800 handle (GMT 8:30 AM). A break below this may perhaps call for a test of the USD 750 support level.
Ripple price just managed to stay above the USD 0.50 support. However, XRP/USD is at a risk of more declines if buyers fail to keep the price above USD 0.50. Other Altcoins Market Today
Most small cap altcoins declined and moved down between 5%-15%. However, two altcoins, CENNZ and GTC grabbed the market attention due to the recent developments, and gained by more than 40%. The current price action suggests that bitcoin price struggled to gain bullish momentum and moved back in a bearish zone. It remains at a risk of more losses and to initiate a fresh recovery, BTC/USD must move back above USD 6,650."
0," Hydro-Quebec, Canada’s biggest electricity provider, has proposed new rules, through which blockchain companies will have to go through a selection process to apply for electricity. The official press release states that these new parameters are in response to an Order-in-Council recently adopted by the government that restricts the amount of electricity sold to blockchain companies. The new regime seeks to allocate up to 500 megawatts, in addition to 120 megawatts of already existing initiatives. Reportedly, the starting rate would be CAD 0.01 (USD 0.0075) per kilowatt hour - 20% more than the industry standard price. Now it’s up to local energy regulator Regie de l’energie to approve the plan. Hydro-Quebec commented on the proposal, “The goal of this process is to both maximize economic spinoffs for Quebec and revenue for Hydro-Quebec - in turn, pushing electricity rates down for customers.” Hydro-Quebec had already temporarily suspended new requests from crypto miners after demand skyrocketed to the point where its short- and medium-term capacity to provide power to the region has been affected. Even back then, an official statement said they would ask the regulator to set aside electricity specifically for crypto miners, and also wants to propose a set rate for mining and blockchain technology-related industries. Canada, and Quebec in particular, had seen crypto migrations since the beginning of this year due to China’s suppression of cryptocurrency mining. Miners had decided to move to the next relatively cheapest region, and Hydro Quebec welcomed the surge of interest but had been unsure of its ability to supply ample energy for the growing sector."
0," The price of bitcoin fell to its lowest point since February today. As of press time, the leading cryptocurrency’s price went as low as $6,063, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), a significant drop considering the day’s opening price of $6,717.20. The near-$700 decline (which saw prices decline roughly 10 percent) effectively brought bitcoin to within $100 of its 2018 low of $5,947, reached February 6. At the time, bitcoin was in free-fall amid regulatory uncertainty, with the decline occurring during the week in which the heads of major U.S. regulators were to meet and discuss the cryptocurrency’s price rise with a committee of U.S. lawmakers. Ultimately, however, no action was taken and the price rebounded 40 percent on the week.  Conditions today, however, look different. At press time, bitcoin’s price – currently hovering just above $6,000 – is down more than 60 percent from the 2018 high of $19,783 set in January. Further, aside from some potential action against smaller Japan-based exchanges, no major news drivers are currently impacting the market. Other cryptocurrencies are following suit as bitcoin continues to flirt with support levels, as shown in data published by sources like OnChainFX. Litecoin, for example – the world’s sixth largest cryptocurrency by market cap – hit its lowest level in 7 months on Friday. The price of ether currently at about $479, roughly 60 percent from its all-time high in December 2017. As it stands, the overall cryptocurrency market cap is $259 billion, down from its high of $813 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Other indicators similarly depict the state of the market as it stands today. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), a popular momentum indicator, demonstrates a weekly value of 41 according to Bitfinex exchange data, a level that was last seen in August 2015. Compared to bitcoin’s lowest weekly RSI level (27) for the prolonged bear market in 2014, current levels show scope for significant additional depreciation. Image via Shutterstock"
0," Bitcoin’s (BTC) bears may be building for a strong comeback, having pushed prices to a eight-day low below $6,300 earlier on Friday. The price fell to $6,286 on Bitfinex at 09:50 UTC, the lowest level since June 14, and, at press time, was changing hands at $6,326, down around 6 percent over 24 hours. As discussed yesterday, the cryptocurrency’s persistent failure to scale the $6,800 mark in a convincing manner had raised the prospects of another leg down in bitcoin prices. It seems that process is now underway. Bitcoin breached the key support of $6,620 a couple of hours ago – signaling that the relief rally from the June 13 low of $6,108 has ended at $6,850 (June 18 high) and the bears have regained control. The technical charts now indicate scope for a drop below $6,000 over the weekend. BTC’s drop below $6,620 has confirmed a rising wedge breakdown – a bearish reversal pattern indicating the corrective rally has ended and the broader bearish trend has resumed. The stage is now set for a drop to $5,090 (target as per the measured height method, i.e. pole height subtracted from breakdown price). The target looks feasible as the long-term technical charts are also biased to the bears.  As seen above, the pennant breakdown confirmed earlier this month opened up downside towards 100-week moving average (MA), currently located at $4,551. Meanwhile, the bearish crossover between the 5-month and 10-month moving averages (MAs) also favors a convincing break below the immediate support of $6,000 (February low).

0," Bitcoin’s (BTC) bulls are struggling to push prices higher, despite a still-favorable short-term set-up on the technical charts. Bitcoin rose to a six-day high of $6,580 on Monday on Bitfinex, adding credence to indications that the cryptocurrency could be in for a relief rally. The bullish bias has strengthened further in the last two days too, courtesy of a bullish Bollinger band breakout and a bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving average (MA). Furthermore, bitcoin refused to embrace the negative narrative on Wednesday after the $31 million hack of South Korea’s Bithumb exchange, indicating that the sellers are likely running dry. Despite all this, though, the cryptocurrency has struggled to find acceptance above $6,800 in the last 72 hours, as seen in the chart below.  Bitcoin printed intraday highs above $6,800 in the last three trading days (as per UTC), but still closed well below the $6,800 mark. The repeated failure to scale $6,800 in a convincing manner forces us to consider the possibility of the bears making a comeback, although the charts do not see that happening while BTC is holding above $6,550. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,730 on Bitfinex.  The chart shows BTC has created a rising wedge –  a bearish continuation pattern. A break below $6,550 (rising wedge support and 50MA support) would put the bears back in the driver’s seat and allow a drop to $6,000. A drop below $6,550 would also push the relative strength index (RSI) below the ascending trendline, further strengthening the bear case. Bitcoin image via Shutterstock"
0," The St. Louis division of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank is now tracking the prices of four cryptocurrencies in its research database. According to an announcement on Tuesday, Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), an extensive database maintained by the central bank’s St. Louis branch, is now offering data points for bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum and litecoin. The price data for the well-known and widely cited economic research database is being provided by the U.S. exchange Coinbase and is updated on a daily basis, according to the announcement. Furthermore, the database makes available the historical price data of the four assets back to as early as 2014. The move to add crypto data is not, perhaps, entirely surprising, given that the St. Louis Federal Reserve – a center for local, national and global economic research – has never shied away from taking a focus on cryptocurrencies. Most recently, speaking at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2018 conference in May, James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, raised concerns that the sheer number of cryptocurrencies these days may bring the risk of a “chaos of exchange rates” that has been seen previously in U.S. history – especially during the civil war. The St. Louis branch has had its eyes bitcoin since as early as 2014, when its vice president, David Andolfatto, hosted a seminar on the topic and notably commented at the time that the innovation is forcing traditional institutions to either “adapt or die.” Federal Reserve image via Shutterstock"
1," Cryptocurrencies have, since their inception and subsequent leap into mainstream awareness, gathered opinions from opposing end of the spectrum. From those hailing the nascent industry as a game changer for the world as we know it, to those equating it to the infamous tulip bubble, everybody has an opinion. Brian Armstrong, CEO and co-founder of Coinbase, US-based cryptocurrency exchange, thinks people are needlessly worried about the current dip: “It can be scary the first time you see it, but to us who have been in the industry for many years, it feels like old news,” he said in a motivational message to his team.   “When there is hype, people are irrationally exuberant. When there is despair, people are irrationally pessimistic. Neither is true,” he continues, adding that the truth is in the middle, and that value correlates to transactions per day and not price. 1/ Shared the following message with the team @coinbase today... pic.twitter.com/XDNDZfCtOp ""I want to encourage you all to ignore the price of crypto and the headlines which will inevitably start to come up. Our job is to rise above that, finding our own intrinsic source of motivation, to come in and do our best work, regardless of what other people think,"" Armstrong said in an attempt to motivate his team. Total cryptocurrency market capitalization: Meanwhile, Chris Concannon, the president of Cboe Global Markets, owner of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, could be successful in demotivating crypto investors. He thinks they should be laying awake at night, fretting over the market movements, especially in relation to ICOs (initial coin offerings) and regulations. Should the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decide ICO tokens are unregistered securities, they would be rendered useless, he told in an interview with Business Insider. Concannon forecasts that, first, the SEC will go after ICO market participants, then, class-action lawsuits against the teams behind ICO projects will surge. ""If you sold someone an unregistered security you are liable to them if they decide to take them to court,"" Concannon said. Who is right - and whether anyone truly is - is anyone’s guess. Armstrong considers the current slump in the market a good way to clear out weak participants. “It gets rid of the people who are in it for the wrong reasons, and it gives us an opportunity to keep making progress while everyone else gets distracted,” he said. Meanwhile, Robert Hockett, a professor of financial regulation at Cornell University, told Business Insider that the cryptoverse is moving out of the ""Wild West"" phase into a ""regulatory scrutiny"" phase. In the short term we'll see the rise of funds to launch class-actions and increased litigation, but in the long term, we'll see a cleansing of the market, according to Hockett. ""It is a legal life cycle of every new asset that becomes highly popular,"" he was quoted as saying. ""It was true for tulips, junk bonds, and mortgage-backed securities, and now crypto."""
1," Pantera Capital’s Digital Asset Fund, one of the best-known hedge funds in the crypto space, fell 26% in May, according to an investor letter sent out by the fund on Tuesday. The loss incurred by Pantera compares with Bitcoins drop of about 15% over the same period. According to a report by Bloomberg, the Digital Asset Fund is currently down by 51% for the year. The fund’s underperformance relative to Bitcoin was mainly due to investments in cryptocurrencies Dash, Waves, Bitshares and OmiseGo, Pantera’s CEO Dan Morehead said in the letter. In the letter, the California-based fund also took aim at Warren Buffet for his negative view on crypto, pointing out that his company, Berkshire Hathaway, avoided the Internet boom in the early 2000s, and therefore missed great investment opportunities in companies like Facebook, Google, and Netflix. “If Berkshire buys Bitcoin as quickly as Apple — it will be in 2045. Buckle in,” the letter said. While 2017 saw an explosion in the number of new crypto hedge funds being set up, 2018 has so far been rather depressing for money managers in this emerging industry. Autonomous Research, an independent research provider on the financial sector, has previously estimated that up to 10 percent of all crypto hedge funds may be forced to shut down this year as they struggle to attract new capital."
1," Bitcoin (BTC) suffered a minor dip last night after it was revealed that hackers had again breached a major cryptocurrency exchange, but the charts still favor a corrective rally to $7,000. The cryptocurrency fell from $6,740 to $6,560 after Bithumb – the sixth largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world by trading volume – confirmed that the attack had happened between late Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning local time, adding that about $31 million-worth of cryptocurrencies had been stolen. The Seoul-based cryptocurrency exchange has now halted all deposit and withdrawal service in order to ensure security and announced that it would fully compensate customers. While the hack highlights the security risks that have plagued the cryptocurrency space and has potential to dent investor sentiment, bitcoin is so far refusing to embrace the negative narrative. At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,630 on Bitfinex – down just 1 percent in the last 24 hours and holding well above the Asian session low of $6,560. BTC’s resilience has ensured the technical charts are retaining short-term bullish bias, and is trading above the support of the 50-candle moving average (MA) on the 4-hour chart, currently at $6,545.  The chart shows a rounding bottom – a bullish reversal pattern – meaning sentiment has gradually shifted from bearish to bullish over the last 10 days. The relative strength index (RSI) is also holding above 50.00 (in bullish territory). BTC also recently witnessed a bullish Bollinger Band breakout, as discussed yesterday. So, the short-term outlook remains positive and only a break below the ascending trendline (dotted yellow line) would weaken the bull case.  As seen above, the bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day MA further indicates a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change. Top image via Shutterstock"
1," Bitcoin price was able to form a base around the USD 6,400 pivot level for an upward move. BTC/USD climbed higher and broke a few hurdles such as USD 6,550 and USD 6,600. Similarly, Ethereum broke the USD 500 resistance to move into a positive zone. Many altcoins staged a comeback and moved higher between 5%-10% during the past three sessions. It seems like the market is preparing for a decent recovery and looks set for more upsides. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price climbed above the USD 6,750 level recently before correcting to USD 6,700. BTC/USD is trading higher by more than 3% with bullish moves. On the upside, the price is facing a crucial resistance just below USD 6,800.
Therefore, a successful push above the USD 6,800 hurdle is needed for an upside acceleration. The next resistances are USD 6,880 and USD 7,000. Supports on the downside are at USD 6,600 and USD 6,550. Ethereum
Ethereum price followed bitcoin and jumped above a major resistance at USD 500. It opened the doors for more gains and ETH/USD traded a few points above the USD 520 level.
At the outset, the price is trading nicely above the USD 500 - USD 510 zone. To the topside, a break above USD 530 could accelerate gains in the near term towards USD 560. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price attempted a close above the USD 900 barrier. It failed, but the current market sentiment for BCH/USD is positive with gains more than 5%. The pair may perhaps break the USD 900 resistance soon to stage a decent upward move towards USD 940 and USD 950.
Ripple price traded higher and tested the USD 0.55 resistance before retreating back to USD 0.54. XRP/USD is trading with a bullish sentiment and it will most likely surpass USD 0.55 to gain momentum.  Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, many altcoins moved higher including FCT, ETC, SYS, Tron, ONT, MKR, BAT and QASH. Out of these, Ethereum Classic is performing really well and it seems like ETC/USD may perhaps trade past USD 16.00 resistance during the coming sessions. To sum up, the market is showing a lot of recovery signs. Having said that, bitcoin must break the USD 7,000 hurdle to confirm a short-term bottom. Similarly, ETH/USD needs to clear the USD 530 resistance."
1," Despite the Chinese central government’s best efforts to drive bitcoin miners out of the country, miners in the more remote interior regions, including Sichuan and Qinghai Province, have shown a surprising resilience, according to a recent report by Nikkei Asian Review. The report also mentions that bitcoin mines in western China’s Qinghai Province are often owned and operated by a group of young people referred to as ‘fuerdai,’ a term used to describe the rich children of the new Chinese elite. With both provinces being considered relatively poor compared to the more developed coastal regions in China, bitcoin mining is seen as viable way to create jobs and generate revenues for the local government, according to the report. Additionally, Sichuan and Qinghai Province both enjoy cheap and often heavily subsidized electricity, making it an ideal location for large-scale bitcoin mining. Nikkei Asian Review further speculates that the reason why Chinese authorities have condoned the activity is due to a desire to better control the flow of money internationally, in an effort to counter the global influence the US exercises through the US dollar. It is estimated that China still controls more than 50% of global bitcoin mining capacity, a fact that just this last week prompted Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse to accuse the digital currency of being “controlled by China.”"
1," Despite the bearish chart setup, bitcoin (BTC) rose to a six-day high on Monday, putting a corrective rally to $7,000 back on the map. The leading cryptocurrency unexpectedly picked up a bid around $6,450 at 16:00 UTC yesterday and rose to $6,850 – the highest level since June 12, according to Bitfinex data. The $400 rally may have trapped a few bears on the wrong side of the market, given the pennant breakdown on the 4-hour chart had called for a drop to $6,000. Yesterday’s gravity-defying price action in BTC has boosted the odds of a rally to $7,024 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $9,990 to $6,108). However, the long-run outlook remains bearish for now. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $6,700 on Bitfinex.  As seen in the chart above, the 4-hour candle crossed the upper Bollinger band in a convincing manner yesterday, signaling a bullish Bollinger band (standard deviation of +2 and -2 on 20-candle moving average) breakout. Trading volume also picked up (circled on chart), adding credence to the bullish move. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency has also found acceptance above the 50-candle moving average (MA) and the relative strength index (RSI) is biased bullish (above 50.00). So, BTC will likely clear the immediate resistance at $6,736 (yellow dotted line) and test supply around $7,024 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop from $9,990 to $6,108) in the next 24 hours. It’s worth noting that the descending (bearish) 100-candle MA is located at $7,045, marking a key resistance level for the bulls. The positive Bollinger band setup also validates the argument put forward by the bullish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence last week that the cryptocurrency has found a temporary low at around $6,100. BTC closed above the 10-day MA yesterday, invalidating the immediate bearish outlook. It also created a bullish outside-day candle on Monday (price action engulfed Sunday’s high and low) – that is, the day began on a pessimistic note, but ended optimistically. Thus, the probability that the corrective rally will gather traction is high. Compass image via Shutterstock"
1," Phillip Nunn, a high-profile blockchain consultant, online influencer and popular public speaker, said in an interview with BusinessCloud.co.uk that he stands by a bold price prediction for bitcoin that he made earlier this year. Nunn predicted back in January of this year that bitcoin would reach a low of USD 6,000 in 2018 before it will rebound to a high of around USD 60,000 by the end of the year. In the interview, Nunn said that even as the bears have dominated the bitcoin market as of late, volatility will ultimately work in favor of the bulls, and added: “I absolutely stand by my prediction.” “What you've got to remember is that the sharpest comparison to crypto in recent years is the dotcom-era, but actually crypto is a whole industry in reverse because the initial investment into it is from the crowd,” he explained. Nunn also told the newspaper that since virtually all the money in the crypto space is from the general public, prices of cryptocurrencies tend to follow investor sentiment rather than normal market fundamentals. “[…] A flood of bad news can wobble the market, stuff like regulation. The industry is so small that there's market manipulation,” Nunn added. Meanwhile, Tom Lee, Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, still thinks that bitcoin could hit USD 25,000 despite the recent drop. Lee believes that once institutional investors jump into the market, there could be solid gains in bitcoin. Following the strong sell-off last week, bitcoin prices have consolidated over the weekend and appears to have found support around USD 6,400 as of press time."
1," Bitcoin (BTC) is once more facing a drop to (or below) $6,000, with both short- and long-duration charts being aligned in favor of the bears. The cryptocurrency found acceptance above the key resistance of $6,425 (April 1 low) in the second half of last week, raising the prospects of a corrective rally towards the $7,000 mark. Further, while a fall to $6,000 following a bear flag breakdown on Friday seemed likely, losses were unexpectedly cut short at $6,300, signaling bearish exhaustion. Yet, the leading cryptocurrency did not find any takers over the weekend, leaving trading flat-lined above $6,500. Courtesy of the drop from $6,573 (Sunday’s high) to $6,370 (today’s low), the short duration charts have now turned bearish. Meanwhile, the long duration charts continue calling a bearish move. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,430 on Bitfinex – down 1.3 percent over 24 hours and is looking southwards.  BTC’s drop to $6,370 earlier today confirmed a downside break of the pennant – a bearish continuation pattern indicating the sell-off from the high of $7,638 has resumed. As a result, the cryptocurrency could slide to $5,820 (target as per the measured height method, i.e. the difference between the pennant high and low subtracted from the breakdown price). The moving averages (MAs) are also biased bearish, with the 50-candle, 100-candle and 200-candle MAs all trending south. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) is struggling to rise above 50.00 (into bullish territory).  BTC remains trapped inside a falling channel, the RSI remains below 50.00 (in bearish territory) and the 10-day MA is falling (bearish).  The 5-week and 10-week MAs are losing altitude, signaling a bearish setup and adding credence to the pennant breakdown. The 10-week MA is about to cross the 50-week MA from above (bearish crossover) for the first time since September 2015. Dice image via Shutterstock"
0," After a wave of Bitcoin mining operations set up in areas with affordable electricity, places like Montana’s Missoula County needed to make a decision over the impact these operations have on the region. Earlier this month, it was reported that Bitcoin’s (BTC) energy footprint had nearly doubled in six months and was expected to grow. According to the study, Bitcoin could be using up approximately 0.5% of the world’s energy by the end of the year, almost the same amount used by the Netherlands. Needless to say, most people might not want that to happen. On Thursday, the Missoula County Commission decided to delay its decision over the suspension of Bitcoin mining to August 2018, according to the local news site the Missoulian. The hearing lasted nearly two hours where presentations and comments from the public were made on the topic of Bitcoin mining operations. Missoula County Commissioner Jean Curtiss had said at the end of the hearing that “we all understand that we don’t understand,” while County Commissioner Cola Rowley noted that this could be a good time for “education and outreach.” The county fears that the energy consumed by these operations could “pose a reliability and safety risk to local electric distribution systems, and affect electric rates for other customers” and that “the high energy loads could pose a fire hazard, and create electronic waste.” If approved, the decision would impose a one-year ban on Bitcoin mining and any new or expanding cryptocurrency activity. >>Did Tether (USDT) Really Manipulate the All-Time Price Highs of Bitcoin (BTC)? Other regions that have suspended Bitcoin mining projects include the Canadian province of Québec, who announced in March that it’s utility services provider Hydro-Québec will not be taking in any more applications for the development of mining operations. The demand for energy was beginning to exceed that supply that Hydro-Québec could supply. Do you think these Bitcoin mining operations should be suspended until we find better reusable energy sources? Featured Image: DepositPhotos/znm666"
0," Bitcoin price was able to recover during the past three sessions above the USD 6,400 and USD 6,500 levels. However, BTC/USD was not able to gain momentum above the USD 6,700 level. Similarly, major altcoins recovered and corrected higher by around 5%, but they all faced many barriers on the upside which prevented gains. The current price action is positive, but buyers need to gather momentum to avoid a bearish reaction. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price recovered above a major resistance at USD 6,500, pushing the market sentiment into a short-term bullish zone. BTC/USD traded close to the USD 6,700 level where sellers took a stand. The price is currently (GMT 6:00 AM) up more than 1% and is trading in a positive zone.
However, buyers need to push the price above the USD 6,700 level to gain upside momentum. On the downside, supports are seen near the USD 6,500 and USD 6,400. If the price stays above the USD 6,400 support, it could continue to move higher. Ethereum
Ethereum price traded above the USD 520 level with positive signs. It is currently up more than 4% and is trading nicely above the USD 500 level. On the upside, should there be a bullish break above the USD 520 level, there could be an upside acceleration above the USD 540 level.
On the downside, a key support is at USD 500. Below this, the price may perhaps move back in a bearish zone towards the USD 480 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price failed to break the USD 900 resistance level once again. BCH/USD is currently trading above the USD 850 level with ranging moves. The price may soon make the next move either above USD 900 or below USD 850 in the near term.
Ripple price traded a few points above the USD 0.5500 resistance, which is a positive zone. The next barrier for XRP/USD is around the USD 0.5700 level where sellers are likely to appear. Other Altcoins Market Today
The market sentiment improved recently and pushed small cap altcoins in a bullish zone. Today, a few coins such as MOAC, BTCP, KCS and MITH gained momentum and climbed between 10-18%. Overall, it seems bitcoin buyers are keeping downsides in check. A close above the USD 6,700 and USD 6,800 resistance levels could boost the sentiment further in the near term."
0," Some of the weakness seen in bitcoin over the past week was likely caused by futures contracts reaching their expiry date, according to Tom Lee, Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors. In a report released on Thursday, Lee blames the sell-off on “significant volatility” around futures expiry dates on the CBOE and CME futures marketplaces. He further cites a theory by Justin Saslaw, cryptoasset investor at Raptor Capital Management, that says bitcoin seems to fall as the related futures are nearing their expiry date. “Bitcoin sees dramatic price changes around CBOE futures expirations... We compiled some of the data and this indeed seems to be true,” Lee wrote in the report. Furthermore, Lee explained that the inflow of new capital to the crypto market this year has been insufficient to make up for the new supply coming from initial coin offerings (ICOs), mining rewards, and outflows due to capital gains taxes. Increased volatility in the underlying markets when futures contracts expire is a well-known phenomenon from stocks and other traditional financial markets. There have been six expirations since CBOE launched their bitcoin futures, with the most recent expiry being on Wednesday June 13. Bitcoin has taken a strong hit this past week, trading down from about USD 7,500 last Sunday to a low of USD 6,135. On Thursday, bitcoin saw a strong rebound and is trading at around USD 6,600 at press time."
1," Bitcoin price extended its downward move below the USD 6,400 level. BTC/USD tested the USD 6,200 support area where buyers emerged. At present (GMT 10:00 AM), the price is recovering and moving higher toward key barriers. Similarly, most major altcoins such as Ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash formed a support base and started an upside correction with positive signs. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price fell further after sellers managed to push the price below the USD 6,400 level. BTC/USD declined a few points below the USD 6,200 support, but later it managed to form a support base near the stated level.
The price started an upward correction and moved above the USD 6,300 level. However, there are many hurdles waiting around the USD 6,700. A break and close above the mentioned hurdle is needed for an upside break toward USD 7,000. Ethereum
Ethereum price settled below the USD 500 level and traded close to USD 450. Later, ETH/USD started an upward move and climbed above the USD 475 level. The price is currently up around 1% and is facing a tough resistance near the USD 500 level.
The price has to move above the USD 500 level to recover further in the near term. On the downside, supports are seen near the USD 460 and USD 450 levels. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price is still struggling as it settled below the USD 900 support. BCH/USD is currently up around 1%, but it is way below the USD 900 pivot level. Supports are seen on the downside around the USD 850 and USD 840 level.
Ripple price tested the USD 0.50 support level before starting a recovery. XRP/USD moved above the USD 0.52 resistance and is currently approaching a major resistance near the USD 0.5500 level. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins started an upward move and climbed higher. Today, coins such as Siacoin, SOC, ICON and Verge registered more than 10% gains and moved into a positive zone. The overall market sentiment is stable, but it is still in a bearish zone. Bitcoin price must climb back above the USD 6,700 and USD 7,000 resistance levels to stage a decent comeback."
1," The price of bitcoin (BTC) may be up slightly Wednesday, but that hasn’t exactly raised the spirits of the asset’s most avid investors. Rather, with the market now down roughly 70 percent from 2017’s highs, many HOLDers, the bitcoin faithful who have vowed never to sell, are becoming convinced they might have seen the last big rally before another long-time bear market (as happened in 2014). In crypto lingo, it’s time to put on some gloves for another “crypto winter.” Put more simply, investors now think they’ll face a long period where the market might be unable to attract new investment. Adding to the reasoning? It’s happened before. The cryptocurrency once dropped by 70 percent in a seven-month time period from June 2014 to January 2015 – the longest bear market time period in crypto. At the time, many people panicked and sold. Except this time, bitcoin’s faithful say they will stay more optimistic. To remind themselves of what happened in the past (and to prepare for a possibly tough time ahead), an online meme titled “things I did during the 14/15 bear market” is trending on social media right now. It all started from Twitter user @PhilCrypto77’s tweet yesterday.
 And then @WhalePanda followed:
 Soon, it was over all Twitter. Some of the posts were pretty serious and inspiring:     Others took a more delightful and entertaining tone:
   Still, it’s important to remember why the meme is still trendy, as it reflects how HODLers have learned how to stay calm during tough times. In some ways, this means even the most sophomoric tweets might actually be a sign that the industry is maturing. So, how are you HODLing up? Bitcoins in snow image via Shutterstock"
1," Bitcoin (BTC) has made a 6 percent recovery from the 90-day low hit on Wednesday, neutralizing the immediate bearish outlook. The leading cryptocurrency fell to $6,108 at around 16:30 UTC yesterday on Bitfinex – its lowest level since February 6 – bolstering the already oversold conditions shown by the daily relative strength index (RSI) yesterday. Hence, the subsequent recovery to $6,500 levels currently is hardly surprising and indicates that bitcoin may have found a temporary bottom around $6,100. However, long-run technical setup remains bearish and the battered bulls will want to see stronger evidence of bear exhaustion before hitting the market with fresh bids. Consequently, the market could remain directionless over the next 48 hours and bargain hunters may chip in later if the cryptocurrency looks stable around $6,500.  While prices fell to $6,108 yesterday, the RSI created a higher low, signaling a bullish divergence. So, the stage is set for a corrective rally, although the upside is seen gathering steam only if bitcoin manages to hold above $6,425 (April 1 low) for next 24 hours. In this case, a move toward $7,000 becomes more of a possibility, or even as high as the falling channel resistance, currently located at $7,380. That will be easier said than done, though, as the moving averages (MAs) are still biased bearish – the 50-candle, 100-candle and 200-candle MAs are all trending south, indicating a bearish setup.  The daily moving averages (5-day and 10-day) seen here are also pointing south, and the broader outlook remains bearish as long as bitcoin is trapped inside the falling channel. Currently, BTC is having a tough time crossing the 5-day MA, currently located at $6,857. Bargain hunters will likely enter the market after the short-term moving averages have bottomed out. While charts show early signs of bear exhaustion, the long-term outlook is still poor for the bulls, as indicated by the pennant breakdown and the bearish crossover between 5-month and 10-month MAs.

0," Tether (USDT) & Bitcoin (BTC) – A new study has surfaced this morning putting Tether in the negative spotlight once again. Last December, Tether was subpoenaed by the U.S Commodity Futures Trading Commission to provide proof that the digital currency was in fact back by a reserve of U.S. dollars. Bitfinex was also subpoenaed due to it losing banking relationships, but continued to remain operational. CEO of Bitfinex, JL van der Velde, spoke out against the accusations last year in an emailed statement and said: “Bitfinex nor Tether is, or has ever, engaged in any sort of market or price manipulation. Tether issuances cannot be used to prop up the price of Bitcoin or any other coin/token on Bitfinex.” Around this time, Bitcoin (BTC) reached its record high of $20,000 a coin, and these events are what prompted John M. Griffin and Amin Shams from the University of Texas Austin Department of Finance to investigate Tether’s movement. >> Is Day-Trading Ruining Bitcoin (BTC)? “Is Bitcoin Really Un-Tethered?” The 66-page research paper suggests that shows that Tether was “used to provide price support and manipulate cryptocurrency prices.” The paper claims that half of Bitcoin’s price rise within December 2017 was due to Tether and its issuer Bitfinex. The research paper says: “Using algorithms to analyze the blockchain data, we find that purchases with Tether are timed following market downturns and result in sizable increases in Bitcoin prices. Less than 1% of hours with such heavy Tether transactions are associated with 50% of the meteoric rise in Bitcoin and 64% of other top cryptocurrencies.” Griffin said in an interview that he’s “looked at a lot of markets” and manipulation in a market leaves tracks in the data. The data tracks with Tether are “very consistent” with a manipulation hypothesis. Griffin and Shams’s paper has been downloaded a total of 2,780 times today and currently has 7,645 abstract views. What will become of the research remains unknown at this time, but Tether (USDT) just passed DASH and Monero to become the 12th largest cryptocurrency by its market cap. Featured Image: Canva"
0," Remember that amazing crypto price surge that happened last December? Of course you do. Well, a group of researchers are claiming these prices were artificially inflated, and some of their colleagues are saying they actually might be onto something. John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas, and Amin Shams, a graduate student, published a report entitled “Is Bitcoin Really Un-Tethered?”, which claims that Bitcoin’s December prices (and alt-coins’ prices, consequently) were manipulated by someone, or a group of people, through the use of the Tether cryptocurrency, and via the Bitfinex exchange - a cryptocurrency exchange that creates and sells Tether.  Tether, or USDT, is a cryptocurrency whose price always equals to that of the US dollar and is used to mediate when trading between different cryptocurrencies. This report, which you can find on this link, isn’t linked to any ‘hard’ evidence, like emails or related documents, but it does rely on numbers. It says that half of all the price surges Bitcoin has seen in the last year happened right after Tether flowed into a few accounts on different exchanges. Usually, this transfer would happen while the price was going down. Speaking to Bloomberg, the author says Tether was used to both stabilize and manipulate the price of Bitcoin.  “Bitfinex nor Tether is, or has ever, engaged in any sort of market or price manipulation,” Bitfinex Chief Executive Officer JL van der Velde said in an emailed statement, according to Bloomberg. “Tether issuances cannot be used to prop up the price of Bitcoin or any other coin/token on Bitfinex.” However, Griffin’s and Shams’ colleagues have voiced their opinions, and they’re saying this report could hold water, if nothing else - because similar methods have been used before to spot price manipulations. According to the New York Times, the report has gotten support from Philip Gradwell, the chief economist at Chainalysis, a blockchain research company, as well as Sarah Meiklejohn, a professor at the University College London (one of the early pioneers of this type of manipulation spotting). The US Justice Department is allegedly looking into possible Bitcoin price manipulation, as well. Also, as reported, the US regulator known as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has launched an investigation into potential price manipulation at four major cryptocurrency exchanges: Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Kraken. The CFTC has subpoenaed the exchanges to hand over sensitive trading data to help in the investigation."
0," Top credit ratings agencies are mulling a plan to downgrade banks that clear bitcoin futures if the volumes of the contracts continues to increase, according to a report by financial news website risk.net on Wednesday. Ratings agencies, including Fitch, S&P and Moody’s, are assessing the impact of bitcoin futures on credit rating. “[The impact on ratings] is something that we think is perhaps not fully appreciated by the market and something that warrants monitoring going forward,” Nathan Flanders, Global Head of Non-Bank Financial Institutions at Fitch Ratings, was quoted as saying.  “For banks, even though they are saying they are not directly engaging in the trading of cryptocurrencies as clearing members, they have some indirect exposure to it, whether they like it or not,” Flanders added. The move came as volumes in the bitcoin futures markets have increased steadily since December last year, when the markets went live on US exchanges CME and CBOE. This has happened despite the fact that the bitcoin price has been in a strong downtrend. On a single trading session on April 26, the combined volume of bitcoin futures on CME and CBOE reached an all-time high of USD 670 million, according to CCN. Although bitcoin futures are traded on exchanges regulated by the US government, the rising volume may have alarmed ratings agencies, which apparently have grown increasingly concerned of potential risks due to the volatility of the bitcoin price. Since December, the price of bitcoin in the spot market has dropped by 66% in a four-month period."
0," Signs are beginning to emerge that bitcoin’s sell-off today may be overextended. After hitting a 70-day low of $6,133 on CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI) hit a level (26.4) last seen in August of 2016, according to data from the Bitfinex exchange. The relative strength index, or RSI, is used for identifying overbought and oversold conditions of an asset by “comparing the magnitude of recent gains and losses over a specified time period to measure speed and change of price.” When such levels are hit, the indicator suggests price action is approaching a level below the asset’s true value, where a price bounce tends to occur.  BTC/USD rarely hits oversold levels (<30) in the daily time frame, but when it does, price has historically performed well for the bulls.

February 6th was the last time RSI levels were below 30, and at that time, prices rallied from $6,000 to $11,788 in just two weeks, resulting in a ~96 percent gain.

Prior to that, on August 14th, 2016, BTC registered an RSI level just above 26 when the price showed $563 on Bitfinex. Even through today, the price of bitcoin has not gone below $563 and current levels represent a ~980% price increase.

 But while the oversold indicators tend to signal downtrend exhaustion, bulls might want to still proceed with caution before celebrating as bitcoin’s daily RSI has reached lower levels. According to Bitfinex data, the lowest level recorded since 2013 was 16.1 on August 18th, 2015. Bitcoin image via Shutterstock"
0," Bitcoin is still looking south, having hit four-month lows today, but the bearish momentum may wane due to short-term oversold conditions, the technical charts indicate. More bears joined the party in the U.S. session Tuesday after the cryptocurrency failed to cross twin resistance at $6,859 (50-hour moving average (MA) and 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement). As a result, the price fell to $6,370 on Bitfinex today, the lowest level since Feb. 6. At press time, bitcoin was slightly higher at $6,453. The drop to the four-month low has bolstered the already bearish technical setup and raised the odds of a sell-off to $6,000 (February low). However, the bears may take a breather over the next day or two, as the relative strength index (RSI) is hovering at the key bullish reversal zone, and bitcoin could hold around support at $6,400 or possibly see a minor corrective rally.  Currently, the RSI is holding below 30.00. Historical data shows BTC stages a “V”-shaped recovery every time the RSI drops to or below 30.00. However, things may pan out differently this time, as long-term technical charts are biased to the bears.  The downside break of the pennant (bearish continuation pattern) indicates scope for a drop below the February low of $6,000. Further, on the weekly chart, the RSI fell below key support of 53.00 in February, signaling a long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change and is currently hovering below 50.00 (still in bearish territory). Clearly, the bears now have more say in determining the BTC/USD exchange rate. So, while the cryptocurrency may make a brief rally, courtesy of the oversold conditions, a major recovery will likely remain elusive. Bitcoin on chart image via Shutterstock"
0," Bitcoin price finally found a strong buying interest near the USD 6,500 and USD 6,600 levels. BTC/USD started an upside correction and is currently recovering above USD 6,800 (GTM 12:10 PM). Similarly, major altcoins are trading with a stable bias above the recent lows and are consolidating. Overall, it seems like the crypto market is currently consolidating losses and there could be further recoveries in the near term. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently trading above the USD 6,750 level with consolidation moves. BTC/USD may correct a few points in the near term toward the USD 6,900 and USD 7,000 levels, which are likely to act as resistances for buyers.
Should there be an upside break above the USD 7,000 level, the price may continue to recover in the near term. On the flip side, if recoveries are capped by the USD 7,000 level, there could be a bearish reaction back towards USD 6,600 in the near term. Ethereum
Ethereum price also corrected higher and moved above the USD 510 and USD 520 levels. However, ETH/USD is facing a strong resistance near the USD 540 - USD 550 zone. An upside break above the mentioned zone is needed for the price to recover toward USD 600.
On the other hand, if the price fails to move past USD 550, there is a risk of another downside reaction towards the USD 510 and USD 500 support levels. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price is holding the USD 900 level with consolidation moves. On the upside, resistances are seen near the USD 950 and USD 960 levels. On the downside, there are many supports around the USD 920 and USD 900 levels.
Ripple price is signaling a decent price action above the USD 0.55 level. However, ETH/USD has to move above the USD 0.60 level to gain bullish traction in the near term. Above this, the price may recover towards USD 0.62. Other Altcoins Market Today
A few small cap altcoins moved into the bullish zone such as Loom Network, Ethereum Classic, Dropil and CyberMiles. The current price action is stable, suggesting short-term consolidation above key support levels. Bitcoin price must move back above the USD 7,000 to stage a solid comeback. If not, there is a risk of another bearish wave."
0," The price of bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell to its lowest point since April 1 on Tuesday. Bitcoin’s value slid to $6,455.92 during the afternoon trading session, dropping more than $280 in the span of two hours, according to data from CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. This represents the lowest figure since the start of April when the BPI registered a low of $6,443. The charts suggest a support of $6,436 – if current levels are broken, the next major support is $6,000, borne from the lows from early February of this year. As of press time, the BPI is reporting a price of $6,523.86.  As of press time, bitcoin is down 5.82 percent in the last 24 hours. Further, on a year-to-date basis, bitcoin is reporting a 60 percent depreciation overall. Tuesday’s session saw downward developments for other major cryptocurrencies as well. For instance, litecoin, the world’s sixth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is now approaching $98 – a price not seen since December of last year. EOS is also down 12% on the day, representing a total decline of 34% since June 4th. Meanwhile, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is just over $280 billion, according to data published by CoinMarketCap. Image via Shutterstock"
0," Bitcoin (BTC) is looking to regain poise after its drop to two-month lows on Sunday, but the recovery will likely be short-lived, the technical charts indicate. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,825 on Bitfinex – up 3 percent from the two-month low of $6,619. The recovery could be associated with extreme oversold conditions highlighted by the relative strength index (RSI) yesterday and could be extended further in the next 24 hours. However, crossing $7,000 in a convincing manner will be easier said than done, as the area around the psychological hurdle is packed with key technical resistance lines. Further, the long duration charts have turned bearish, so holding on to gains above $7,000 will be a challenge for BTC’s bulls. Hence, the recovery could turn out to be a dead cat bounce – a temporary recovery in a bear market that is followed by a resumption of the downtrend.  On the way higher, BTC could face stiff resistance at May 29 low of 7,040 (former support turned resistance). Interestingly, the pennant floor (former support) is also lined up at $7,040. Further, a key Fibonacci retracement level is located around $7,000, as seen in the chart below.  The 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the latest leg down in prices is $7,008. What’s more, the cryptocurrency is struggling to find acceptance above $6,859 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement). The failure to beat a less important Fibonacci hurdle only indicates how tough it could be for bitcoin to scale $7,008 (38.2 percent Fibonacci hurdle). The bearish moving averages could also complicate the recovery in bitcoin prices. The 50-hour, 100-hour and 200-hour moving averages (MAs) are all trending south indicating a bearish setup. Meanwhile, the long duration charts are biased to the bears too.  The bearish crossover between the 5-month and 10-month MA also indicates the tide has turned in favor of the bears.  As discussed yesterday, the downside break of the pennant pattern has revived the bear market and opened the doors for a drop below the February low of $6,000. The pennant breakdown also adds credence to BTC’s bearish close below the 50-week MA in May. And, last but not the least, the charts also show there is a lot of space to the downside as a major support is seen directly at $6,000 (Feb low). A violation there would open up downside towards $4,496 (100-week moving average) and $3,300 (trendline drawn from the August 2015 low and March 2017 low). Chinese cat statues image via Shutterstock"
1," Bitcoin price is under heavy bearish pressure as there was a rejection from the USD 7,800 level. BTC/USD declined sharply and moved below the USD 7,400 and USD 7,000 support levels. Similarly, all major altcoins declined sharply and broke key support levels. The current market sentiment is very bearish, pointing more declines in the near term. ""A deeper analysis reveals that the media may be attributing too much of this plunge to the CoinRail hack,"" Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, said in a market commentary. According to him, the big drop came more than 15 hours after the news was fully digested by the markets: ""The industry has certainly seen much bigger hacks before and other than a technical price level, this doesn't change much for the path of the industry over the next five years."" ""At the moment, we know that the infrastructure is still under construction, and some very big investors stand ready to enter the market. However, they will most likely wait until an upswing to join in. We got a taste of that in mid-April when FOMO hit the market like a ton of bricks but in the end wasn't strong enough to change the trend just yet,"" Greenspan said.  Bitcoin
Bitcoin price failed to surpass the USD 7,800 barrier on many occasions, which resulted in a downside reaction. BTC/USD declined heavily and moved below the USD 7,000 handle. It almost traded close to the USD 6,500 support level and formed a low around USD 6,600.
At the moment, the price is currently consolidating losses above the USD 6,500 support. On the upside, there are a few important resistances around the USD 6,800 and USD 7,000 levels. Supports are near USD 6,600 and USD 6,500. Ethereum
Ethereum was rejected from the USD 620 barrier, which ignited a sharp downside move. ETH/USD tumbled and broke a few important supports such as USD 560 and USD 550. The price traded close to the USD 500 and a low was formed near USD 510.
On the upside, there are resistances near the USD 550 zone. Above this, the price will most likely face a strong resistance near the USD 580 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price also declined heavily and broke the USD 1,040 and USD 1,000 support levels. BCH/USD traded close to the USD 950 support and is currently correcting higher. On the upside, resistances are at USD 1,000, USD 1,020 and USD 1,040.
Ripple price broke a key pivot level at USD 0.65, opening the doors for more losses. XRP/USD even settled below the USD 0.60 level and moved into a bearish zone. If there is an upside correction, the price could face hurdles near the broke USD 0.60 level. Other Altcoins Market Today
Most small cap coins moved down and are currently in the red zone. The current market sentiment is clearly bearish, but with oversold conditions. Therefore, there can be a bounce back in bitcoin and altcoins towards the broken support levels in the near term."
1," The price of bitcoin fell sharply on Sunday and early Monday morning after Coinrail, South Korea’s 7th biggest exchange said it was hacked, possibly to the tune of over USD 37.3 million. According to data from Coinbase, bitcoin dropped 10% to around USD 6,770 – the lowest level for the cryptocurrency since April 12. On Monday morning, the price was still hovering below the USD 6,800 level, after a slight increase during the early hours of the Asian trading session. The sell-off on Sunday followed news reports about a hack at Coinrail. The exchange said it was the victim of a “dawn raid” on its wallets on June 10, with hackers active on its system for up to 40 minutes, where they succeeded in accessing Pundi X (NPXS), Aston (ATX) and NPER funds. Some media reports claim Tron funds were also affected, and that the total losses may actually exceed USD 40 million, but the company has not yet issued confirmation. The company, which is the seventh biggest in the country by trading volume, says it has suspended all operations, and has safeguarded 70% of its customers’ funds. Also, Coinrail says it has successfully “frozen or recalled” some 66% of the hacked funds and stated that all of its assets are now in a cold wallet, where they will remain until the company’s network “has been stabilized.” Per a company statement, Coinrail also said it was working in close collaboration with the police. While most media sources in South Korea are claiming that over USD 37 million was taken, Coinrail is yet to confirm or deny these estimates, stating, “The exact extent of the damage is currently being calculated, and this may take some time.” The company said that it was unable to reveal many of the details of the hack as doing so “may interfere with the police investigation,” but added that it was in close talks with the coins’ developers. Joongang Ilbo points out that Coinrail had run into trouble with the Fair Trade Commission this year over clauses in its terms and conditions that appeared to absolve the company of blame in the event of “damages.” As reported previously on Cryptonews.com, a total of 12 exchanges (of which Coinrail was one) were ordered to make significant changes to “unfair” customer policies in April. The FTC claimed that exchanges’ terms “did not exempt them from liability” in the event of the loss or theft of customer funds. Exchange hackings have become a major issue for the cryptocurrency market in recent years, and continues to shake the market every time they occur. It is estimated that since 2014, hackings on exchanges have cost investors at least USD 1.4 billion. However, according to Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, a deeper analysis reveals that the media may be attributing too much of this plunge to the CoinRail hack. He stressed that the big drop came more than 15 hours after the news was fully digested by the markets: ""The industry has certainly seen much bigger hacks before and other than a technical price level, this doesn't change much for the path of the industry over the next five years."" ""At the moment, we know that the infrastructure is still under construction, and some very big investors stand ready to enter the market. However, they will most likely wait until an upswing to join in. We got a taste of that in mid-April when FOMO hit the market like a ton of bricks but in the end wasn't strong enough to change the trend just yet,"" Greenspan said.  CFTC Investigating Bitcoin Price Manipulation Other cryptocurrencies such as ethereum, ripple XRP and bitcoin cash all dropped more than 11 percent on Sunday. The sharp declines in crypto prices on Sunday also followed news that the US regulator known as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has launched an investigation into potential price manipulation at four major cryptocurrency exchanges: Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Kraken. According to news reports, the CFTC has subpoenaed the exchanges to hand over sensitive trading data to help in the investigation."
1," The bitcoin market has come alive in the last 36 hours, with the bears gaining the upper hand and now aiming for fresh 2018 lows below $6,000. The cryptocurrency dropped nearly 10 percent on Sunday, hitting a two-month low of $6,619 on Bitfinex, having spent the last two weeks trading in the narrow range of $7,000–$7,800. Across the media, the price drop has been put down to a hack on South Korean exchange Coinrail, revealed Sunday, and renewed concerns regarding security at cryptocurrency exchanges. However, a big move was expected anyway – as an extended period of consolidation or low volatility is often followed by a sharp move on either side  – and prices started falling Saturday, so the theft of ERC-20 tokens at a minor exchange seems an unlikely cause. Either way, the technical studies now spell trouble for bitcoin. The convincing move below $7,000 marks a downside break of the four-month-long narrowing price range and has opened the doors for a drop below $6,000 (Feb. 6 low). As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,773 on Bitfinex – down 6.4 percent in the last 24 hours.  The cryptocurrency created a pennant in the last four months, signaling that the sell-off from the December record high of $19,891 had ended at $6,000. An upside break of the pennant would have signaled a long-run bearish-to-bullish trend change. However, prices closed (as per UTC) well below the pennant support yesterday, implying a downside break of the pennant pattern and a resumption of the sell-off from the December high. The chart also shows a bearish crossover between 5-week and 10-week moving averages (MAs). The relative strength index is also biased bearish (below 50.00). So, bitcoin looks set to extend the decline over the next couple of weeks. On the downside, support is seen at $6,000 (February low), $4,496 (100-week moving average) and $3,300 (trendline drawn from the August 2015 low and March 2017 low). While the bears appear to be in control, minor corrective rallies could be seen, as the cryptocurrency looks oversold as per short duration chart studies.  The extreme oversold conditions as shown by the relative strength index could put a temporary bid under bitcoin. However, the long-term bearish breakdown as seen in the weekly chart will likely restrict the corrective rally to around $7,200. Bitcoin and chart image via Shutterstock"
1," The price of bitcoin dropped $500 in a single hour Sunday to hit a two-month low below $6,700. According to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is now changing hands at $6,718, up slightly after reaching a daily low of $6,647, its lowest total since April 10. Indeed, data shows that over the last 24-hours bitcoin failed to find solid support in the $7,470 zone, before plummeting 11 percent to $6,647.  For traders, this means bitcoin’s two-month uptrend appears to be in question. Trading at around $6,700, bitcoin is now within striking distance of its 2018 low of $5,947 set in February. With the bitcoin price declining, so too has the market for all cryptocurrencies, with now stands at $295 billion, down from $340 billion yesterday. The figure also marked a two-month low for the broader market. Nearly all cryptocurrencies listed show a 10-20 percent decline in price over the last 24-hours.

0," Bitcoin day traders appear to be on the rise. The Financial Times reports that there is as much Bitcoin (BTC) owned by short-term speculators as there is by HODLers, or long-term investors, now. Blockchain research company Chainalysis discovered the Bitcoin data. This data shows that the amount of BTC held by day traders has increased to 5.1 million Bitcoin since December 2017. Bitcoin HODLers, people who have held BTC for longer than a year, together hold around 6 million Bitcoin. While these numbers aren’t quite on par yet, the chief economist at Chainalysis, Philip Gradwell, believes that this might be a “fundamental driver” behind the biggest crypto’s recent price decline. Gradwell explained that the growing number of Bitcoin day traders is causing a rise in liquidity for the coin, which could be part of what’s causing the Bitcoin price to drop. Other data discovered by Chainalysis should come as no surprise to most. Chainalysis also pointed out that a large amount of BTC is held by Bitcoin whales. Whales in crypto are typically large corporations or groups. There is around 17 million Bitcoin available and circulating. Of that, almost a third is held by only a few Bitcoin wallets. The Chainalysis data revealed that approximately 1,600 Bitcoin wallets each held about 1,000 BTCs, which, all together, would amount to around 5 million Bitcoin. This may also be affecting Bitcoin’s price. It’s very possible that the Bitcoin whales could be manipulating prices (for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies) to their advantage. If a whale sells some BTC, it’s enough to cause the price to drop, thus creating a chain reaction of FUD making others sell their BTC and making the Bitcoin price drop even further. Then, the whale(s) buy up even more BTC when the price is lower than they initially sold it for. This may or may not be happening, but there are concerns circulating that this could be the case.

0," Robert Sluymer of Fundstrat Global Advisors spoke for CNBC’s Fast Money on Thursday, saying that he believes Bitcoin is bottoming out at USD 7,000 and that it could start rising again as soon as within the next few days. Bitcoin has previously indeed started rising after hitting the USD 7,000 mark, and Sluymer believes this to be the first step in price recovery. “Bitcoin is stuck in purgatory,” Melissa Lee of CNBC begins, while Bob Pisani of the New York Stock Exchange says that the current narrow range of around USD 600 is unusual for Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. Bitcoin futures trading volume fell since May, with Asian markets less intimidated than the US ones. The US Securities and Exchange Commission regulatory issues are also considered one of the constraints for cryptocurrency prices recently. Growing numbers of trading desks for cryptocurrencies are also a surprising turn of events, as this may be the only area where those are rising. Guy Adami, an American trader, TV personality, and professional investor, considers this healthy, as it speaks of the marketplace maturing. Sluymer, meanwhile, points out that the long-term trend is still technically up when considering the graph of price fluctuation since 2016. All lows were a series of high lows compared to the previous ones. In his opinion, Bitcoin is currently in the bottoming phase, and now it’s at the point where it’s challenging its downtrend, but that it needs to get through USD 7,800 to prove its trend reversal. As previously reported, according to a popular crypto analyst, Willy Woo, the USD 8,000 support was bound to give up. He thinks that the next support sits near USD 7,000, which may perhaps break if sellers remain in control. Finally, there may possibly be a correction going into the July-September period, followed by an accumulation phase."
0," Bitcoin price did not break the USD 7,750 resistance and corrected a few points lower. There was no major downward move and the current wave can be a consolidation phase. Similarly, major altcoins such as ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and litecoin traded in a tiny range with a slight bearish angle. The current technical structure suggests that bitcoin and altcoins may correct a few points, but the overall bias is still positive. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price started a minor downside correction and traded below the USD 7,700 level. BTC/USD is currently trading flat around the USD 7,600 (GMT 09:10 AM) level with immediate supports near USD 7,580 and USD 7,550. Below this last, the price will most likely retest the USD 7,400 support.
To the topside, the recent high near USD 7,750 may perhaps prevent upsides in the short term. Should bitcoin buyers succeed in clearing the USD 7,750 resistance, there could be more gains toward the USD 8,000 level in the near term. Ethereum
Ethereum was confined in a tiny range below the USD 620 resistance. ETH/USD attempted to break the USD 615 and USD 620 resistance levels on a couple of occasions, but it failed.
The price may decline a few points, but the USD 600 and USD 590 support levels are likely to prevent declines. On the flip side, a break above the USD 620 barrier may possibly open the doors for a push toward the USD 640 - USD 650 zone. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price is down around 2.5% to USD 1,110. BCH/USD struggled to settle above the USD 1,140 level, which ignited a bearish reaction. The price must stay above the USD 1,100 support to bounce back. If not, it could decline towards the USD 1,060 support.
Ripple price is still above the USD 0.65 support level. However, XRP/USD started a minor corrective wave from the USD 0.675 resistance. The pair may correct a few points more in the short term, but it is likely to find a strong buying interest around USD 0.65.  Other Altcoins Market Today
Most small cap coins traded in a range with tiny gains. Altcoins such as BIX, HT, Siacoin, Decred and Waves performed well during the past few sessions and registered more than 5% gains.  Overall, the current price action is mostly ranging. There may be more downsides, but it could be buying opportunity."
0," Bitcoin has been squeezed into an increasingly narrow range for more than two weeks and is now experiencing volatility not seen for eight months. As a result, it’s looking likely that bitcoin could soon make a strong move, but the direction it will take when that happens is less than clear. Since May 24, the cryptocurrency has been restricted to a range of $7,000–$7,800 range, which is already very tight, but the price has barely moved in the last 36 hours, likely indicating an indecisive market. Daily volatility, as indicated by the spread between the daily price high and daily price low, fell to $107.63 on Thursday – the lowest level since Oct. 2, 2017 and down 86 percent from the 2018 average of $793, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). As of writing, prices on CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) are at $7,580, marking around a $100 drop over 24 hours. if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""r9MYq""]={},window.datawrapper[""r9MYq""].embedDeltas={""100"":474.020834,""200"":420.020834,""300"":420.020834,""400"":394.020834,""500"":394.020834,""700"":394.020834,""800"":394.020834,""900"":394.020834,""1000"":394.020834},window.datawrapper[""r9MYq""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-r9MYq""),window.datawrapper[""r9MYq""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""r9MYq""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""r9MYq""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""r9MYq""==b)window.datawrapper[""r9MYq""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""});
While all is calm now it may not continue that way for long, as an extended period of sideways action is often followed by a violent move on either side. As technical theory states, the wider the range and the longer the period of the consolidation, the more violent a breakout tends to be. So, bitcoin could see a speedy $800 move very soon – in either direction.  Bitcoin had looked set up for a major bullish move earlier this week, following an upside break of the falling channel. Now the bull’s failure to cross resistance at $7,780 has left the doors open for the bears to make a comeback. As a result, the probability of bitcoin ending the period of consolidation with a downside break is the more likely of the two possibilities. Indeed, prices are starting to drop at press time.

1," The launch of Bitcoin ETF’s could drive Bitcoin (BTC) price higher. Although the SEC has previously denied permitting Bitcoin ETF trading, two asset management firms have collectively submitted a new application to introduce regulated Bitcoin ETF’s (Exchange-Traded Funds). SolidX Management LLC and New York-based asset manager Van Eck Associates Corp said their new product would cover all the concerns that the SEC has highlighted in their previous denial.  “I believe that Bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios,” Jan van Eck, the chief executive officer of VanEck, said in a statement.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com The main targeted investors for this ETF are institutional investors rather than retail traders. This is due to the SEC’s warning that cryptocurrencies carry a higher risk for retail investors. The high price tag of $200,000 per share is an indication that institutional investors are taking interest in regulated Bitcoin ETF’s. SEC had also raised concerns about a lack of transparency on online platforms, which they believe are much easier to manipulate. The firms are now planning to introduce a trading desk for price data instead of doing all the business through online platforms.  What Would be the Impact of Bitcoin ETF’s on Crypto Markets?  Source Image: twitter.com Bitcoin market pundits, on the other hand, believe Bitcoin ETF’s could attract a huge amount of investments in cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin price and the rest of cryptocurrency market rose slightly higher amid renewed prospects for the launch of regulated Bitcoin ETF’s. >>Cardano [ADA] Brand Refresh – Cardano Roadmap Gets Overhaul The cryptocurrency markets, on the other hand, have been desperately waiting for fundamental support or investments from Wall Street investors to create a new bull-run. Though it’s too early to say whether SEC will accept the request, traders believe ETF’s launch could create a huge rally in Bitcoin price in the coming days.

1," No matter what experts might say on crypto adoption, real world examples have looked favorably upon the emerging technology. For example, one of the smallest countries in the EU, Slovenia, has announced that its largest shopping center, already named BTC City, will transform into a complete Bitcoin city. Meanwhile, farmers and small businesses in a Russian village have ditched the ruble in favor of cryptocurrency for local trade. Slovenia, the country of origin for one of the oldest crypto exchanges Bitstamp, has announced that every store in BTC City shopping mall will accept cryptocurrency and operate via blockchain technology, Bitcoin Magazine reported. The mall contains over 500 retail stores. It presently holds several travel and tourism ventures, a luxury hotel and casino, a multiplex cinema, a waterpark and the Crystal Palace office park. Representatives of BTC City said, “The development of BTC City into a Bitcoin city is an important step toward the realization of BTC’s openness-oriented strategy, providing its customers and business partners with both freedom and choices regarding their purchases with new forms of payment.” Meanwhile, farmers and small businesses in the Russian village Kolionovo, 80 miles from Moscow, chose to pay with a cryptocurrency called Kolion instead of the ruble because banks charged huge interest rates when lending, CNN reported. A banker turned farmer Mikhail Shlyapnikov created the currency by issuing paper kolions in 2014 which was banned by Russian court in 2015, which made him go for a crypto version, raising USD 500,000 in an initial coin offering. Kolions can’t be mined, but are instead either bought or “plowed” - helping the villagers with farming and construction. Shlyapnikov told CNN, “We now have about USD 2 million in kolions because its value has jumped since the ICO,” and adds that the coin is backed by a reserve of 500 Bitcoin. In his opinion, this cryptocurrency is a way for them to insulate themselves from Russia's financial system."
1," Bitcoin price formed a decent support base around USD 7,500 and started an upward move. It broke a major hurdle near USD 7,650 to place itself in a bullish zone. Similarly, major altcoins gained traction and are currently slowly moving higher. It seems like the crypto market is setting up for more gains in the near term considering the current sentiment remains intact. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price traded higher and cleared a couple of important resistances such as USD 7,650 and USD 7,700. BTC/USD traded close to the USD 7,800 level before retreating to USD 7,710. On the downside, supports are seen near USD 7,650 and USD 7,600, followed by the all-important USD 7,500.
On the upside, the USD 7,750 and USD 7,780 levels are short-term resistances. A push above this last could clear the path for an upside acceleration above the USD 7,800 level to test the USD 8,000 barrier. Ethereum
Ethereum remained stable above the USD 600 handle with positive signs. It seems like ETH/USD is currently consolidating above USD 600 (GMT 9:00 AM) and is preparing for the next major break.
Should the price settle above USD 620, there could be a test of the USD 650 resistance. On the flip side, a downside break below USD 600 may perhaps call for a larger bearish correction toward the USD 570 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price is slowly grinding higher and is currently up more than 1% to USD 1,150. BCH/USD is likely to continue higher towards the USD 1,180 and USD 1,200 resistance levels. On the downside, supports are seen near the USD 1,120 and USD 1,100 levels.
Ripple price is performing really well, and it might soon test the USD 0.70 resistance. A break above the stated resistance will most likely set the pace for a test of the USD 0.75 barrier. Supports on the downside are at USD 0.665 and 0.650.  Other Altcoins Market Today
Most small cap coins are in the green zone today, including Aeternity, Siacoin, Skycoin, NEM, Nano, WTC, ZIL and Augur. The current market sentiment is very positive and if bitcoin price continues to stay above the USD 7,500 pivot level, there could be upsides in the near term."
1," Still stuck in a narrowing price range, BTC could soon rise to resistance above $8,000 if the bulls are able to leap the 50-week moving average hurdle. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,770 on Bitfinex, having been stuck in a narrowing price range (pennant) for months now. Defense of $7,000 last week and the 9.3 percent rise since then have neutralized the immediate bearish outlook and got investors talking about a possible rally to pennant resistance at $8,870. While that target may appear far-fetched, it may be put to test if bitcoin can first scale the key 50-week moving average (MA) resistance (currently located at $7,819) in a convincing manner.  As seen in the chart above, BTC narrowly avoided a downside (bearish) break of the narrowing price range last week, turning higher from $7,040. A bearish breakdown would have signaled a resumption of the sell-off from the record high of $19,891 and could have pushed BTC below $6,000 (February low). However, the subsequent rally to close to $7,700 has neutralized that threat. While it’s still too early to say that bitcoin is now aiming for $8,880 (pennant resistance), the probability would rise sharply if we see an aggressive run above the significant resistance of the 50-week MA. Such a move would invalidate the long-run bearish reversal indicated by the weekly close in the third week of May below the moving average. A move above the 50-week MA would also need to be backed by a solid rise in trading volumes to break out of the pennant. In a promising sign for the bulls, the daily chart below shows that bitcoin is positioned for a convincing break above the 50-week moving average hurdle.  The upside break of the falling channel seen earlier this week indicates a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change. The 5- and 10-day MAs are also biased to the bulls, as is the higher lows pattern indicated by the rising trendline. So, a break above the immediate resistance at $7,780 (June 3 high) could yield a quisignificantck rally to over $8,000. The bullish move would also add credence to “6th of the month” theory, which had hinted at a major bullish reversal based on an alternating monthly cycle.

1," Planet Earth has overcome many challenges in its lifetime. Now it faces a new one: Bitcoin’s energy footprint. The challenge comes courtesy of a new peer-reviewed study, released on Wednesday, June 6, 2018.  Six months ago, Grist, an environmental magazine, wrote about Bitcoin’s energy footprint. Fast forward to June of 2018, and a new study has found that Bitcoin’s energy footprint has more than doubled since that article was first published. There’s more, though. The study also reported that Bitcoin’s energy footprint is likely to double again by the end of 2018. If this happens, Bitcoin will be eating up 0.5% of the globe’s electricity. For perspective, that’s roughly as much as the Netherlands.  Now, this information might not be new to everyone, but it’s likely to still have a shock factor. The author of the study, Alex de Vries, has posted these calculations before, but this is the first time Bitcoin’s energy footprint has been published in an academic journal. Being published in a peer-reviewed journal is important as it means the information included is true. No fake news. These articles go through extensive rounds of fact-checking and are written by credible sources.  By late 2019, the study found that Bitcoin could be using more electricity than all the solar panels in the world currently produce. This is roughly 1.8% of global electricity.  As concerning as this is, it’s not like it is new information to the world. Numerous countries, like Canada and Iceland, have openly stated that crypto energy consumption is getting marginally out of hand. Specifically, Iceland and Canada have spoken of too much energy being used for cryptocurrency mining projects. However, Iceland said that even though it knows the risks, it’s still going to put most of its energy towards the crypto sector.  This is a troubling trajectory. Why? Well, for starters, we are living in a world that should be restraining our energy use and fighting Global Warming. Instead, we are using more energy than we can afford to use, and it’s for something that not everyone can benefit from or wants to benefit from.  That’s just a few people’s opinions, though. What do you think? Speaking of Bitcoin, the virtual currency is still below the $8,000 mark on the market. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently down 1.44% in the past twenty-four hours.   Source: CoinMarketCap Featured Image: depositphotos/JohanSwanepoel"
1," Bitcoin (BTC) is a perfect store of value, but it’s not a Panacea that could solve all the global financial problems, according to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. Brad Garlinghouse – who previously predicted that only a few altcoins would exist in the next few years, now says Bitcoin doesn’t have the potential to become the global currency. The CEO, however, thinks Bitcoin will continue to work as the store of value; saying “We as a world have decided to store the value to the tune of about $130 billion… that’s a store of value. It’s hard to argue that.”  Source Image: firefox Although he claims that there is no competition among cryptocurrencies, he still believes that Bitcoin cannot compete with XRP as a means of transfer of payments. Brad Garlinghouse has continuously been criticizing Bitcoin’s dominating position in cryptocurrency markets. He thinks Ripple is in a better place to lead the cryptocurrency market considering mass adaptation from banks and payment services companies. Explaining his stance, the CEO said, “the Bitcoin blockchain, the technology that underpins the cryptocurrency, is “quite slow,” whereas XRP transactions are “a thousand times faster.” Bitcoin blockchain network on average takes 42 minutes for each transaction based on Blockchain.info record while XRP’s transaction stands in the range of four seconds.  Source Image: twitter.com Ripple CEO has previously highlighted his concerns over the correlation between Bitcoin price and the rest of digital currencies, saying “There’s a very high correlation between the price of XRP and the price of bitcoin, but ultimately these are independent open-sourced technologies.”  Source Image: twitter.com Brad Garlinghouse looks so optimistic over the future fundamentals of XRP network; the claim for mass adaptation isn’t out of context as RippleNet agrees with more than 100 companies and banks to enhance their domestic and cross-border payments.

1," Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, remains the best-known pseudonym in the cryptoverse, and this mystery is one many people are content to leave unsolved. Still, every time something new about the mysterious creator surfaces, the community wants to know - at least to add some level of humanity to their hero. Although she/he/they vanished - not quite in a puff of smoke - there are some proverbial breadcrumbs left behind, especially in Bitcoin’s whitepaper. He also posted in some forums and exchanged emails with some early Bitcoin developers. One of them was Laszlo Hanyecz, best known for buying two pizzas using 10,000 Bitcoins, now worth USD 77 million, which brought the Bitcoin Pizza Day to life as some sort of holiday. According to Business Insider, Hanyecz had been mining bitcoins on his laptop and he expressed interest in contributing to the cryptocurrency's development online. The developer claims that over the coming year, Nakamoto sent him tasks to complete.  Hanyecz calls Nakamoto paranoid, bossy and kind of weird. “He seemed very paranoid about people breaking the software. He kept calling it ‘prerelease,’ and I was helping him get it to release,” he explains. Apparently, Nakamoto consistently gave him a weird feeling.  He says the Bitcoin creator treated him like a full-time employee, although he did the work for Bitcoin for free and as a side gig, since he had a full-time job already.  Also, Nakamoto wasn’t too thrilled with Hanyecz’s mining, either. “He said, ‘Well, I'd rather not have you do the mining too much,’” Hanyecz said. “He was trying to grow the community and get more commerce use cases. He fully recognized that mining would become a thing where a few people would get wealthy.”  Still, the developer says he has deep respect for both Nakamoto's project and the person or team behind the name."
1," Bitcoin found support below the USD 7,400 level and started an upward move. BTC/USD jumped above the USD 7,500 resistance to gain traction. Similarly, major altcoins recovered nicely and moved above key resistances. The best of the lot was Ethereum, breaking the USD 600 barrier. Overall, the market sentiment improved, which could lead more upsides in bitcoin and altcoins in the near term. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently trading 2.5% higher to USD 7,620 (GMT 09:30), with an immediate resistance near the USD 7,680 level. Above this, the BTC/USD pair will most likely accelerate gains towards the USD 7,800 and USD 8,000 resistance levels.
On the flip side, if the price starts a downside correction, the USD 7,500 level may act as a decent support. Below the stated USD 7,500 support, the next key support zone is near the USD 7,400 and 7,350 levels. Ethereum
Ethereum jumped back above the USD 600 barrier, which is a positive sign. However, ETH/USD is struggling to gain upside momentum above the USD 610 and USD 620 resistance levels. Once there is a break above USD 620, the price will most likely revisit the USD 650 zone.
A bearish reaction from the current levels may perhaps push the price back in a negative zone below USD 600. The next key supports on the downside are at USD 580 and USD 575. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash gained bullish momentum from the USD 1,050 support area and broke the USD 1,100 barrier. BCH/USD is currently up more than 4.5% and is trading well above the USD 1,100 level. The next resistances on the upside are at USD 1,150 and USD 1,160. Supports on the downside are at USD 1,100 and USD 1,080.
Ripple price remained in a bullish zone above USD 0.65. XRP/USD is slowly grinding higher and is currently trading near the USD 0.67 level. The next major hurdle for buyers is near the USD 0.70 level. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins gained bullish traction today, including NXS, BNB, ONT, WTC, GXChain, ReddCoin, VERI and ELA. Should the current market sentiment remain intact, there could be more gains in the altcoins in the near term. Additionally, a break above the USD 7,650 resistance may perhaps accelerate bullish moves in BTC and altcoins."
1," Bitcoin (BTC) continues to operate in bearish territory and only a move above $7,780 would put the bulls back into the driver’s seat, the technical charts indicate. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,591 on Bitfinex. The cryptocurrency was on the defensive yesterday, courtesy of a failed breakout and a rising-wedge breakdown and looked set to re-test the recent low of $7,040. However, sellers ran out of steam at $7,372, as indicated by a doji candle and prices moved back above $7,600 in the Asian session today. While the exact reason behind the bear exhaustion is unclear, it fits with a recently observed pattern that bitcoin changes direction in favor of the weaker side on, or close to, the sixth day of every month. The cryptocurrency is down more than 30 percent from the recent high of $9,990, meaning the bulls are on the back foot. So bitcoin could turn higher today, as indicated by the historical pattern. Furthermore, the fear of getting trapped on the wrong side of the market may have forced the bears to stay on the sidelines, despite the false breakout and rising-wedge breakdown. That said, the cryptocurrency is still treading waters in the bearish territory, as seen in the chart below.  The bearish rising-wedge breakdown remains valid as long as bitcoin keeps trading below $7,780 (June 3 high). So, the downside is still in play and the sell-off could accelerate if the support at $7,372 is breached. However, the 50-candle moving average (MA) has started rising in favor of the bulls and the 100-candle MA has flatlined (shed bearish bias), so the odds of a break below $7,372 are low.

1," Bitcoin News: Bitcoin (BTC) obsession has been declining at a staggering pace since the start of this year; the largest coin couldn’t sustain trader’s attention and the confidence that it had attained in the final quarter of last year. Cryptocurrency market analysts are blaming declining trader’s interest for the bearish trend over the last couple of months. They believe Bitcoin needs substantial fundamental support to rebuild trader’s confidence, either from its network or through Wall Street investments.  Searches for Bitcoin plunged almost 75% since the start of this year – which isn’t a good sign for the price performance of crypto coins. Searches for Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are also down more than 70% in the past five months. Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, has shown his concerns on declining trader attention towards bitcoin and other digital currencies. The researcher said, “We use Google Trends to track search queries for ‘bitcoin’ as a proxy for potential new buyers,” Colas said in an email to clients Monday. “Bitcoin needs a new narrative in order to reestablish global attention.”  Nicholas Colas is certainly right about the cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin and the rest of the digital currencies failed to gain traders attention amid the lack of fundamental support. The co-founder of DataTrek Research further claims that he loves Bitcoin; saying “While we love the idea of Bitcoin (and own a little ourselves), we are not fans of buying it at current levels.” >>Monero & Tron Update – Below Expectations The market pundits believe that Bitcoin needs support from regulators all around the globe to strengthen trader’s confidence. The reports of fraud, unfair trading practices, and money laundering issues have negatively contributed to the Bitcoin mania. Wall Street Adaptation could also provide a new life to cryptocurrency markets. Featured Image: twitter"
1," According to Tom Lee, Bears aren’t accurately reading declining volume, tumbling Google search trends and prospects for the price crash. Indeed, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee believes Bitcoin is offering a strong buying opportunity for long-term investors, as he expects the largest coin to trade around $25K by the end of the year.  Bears emphasize that a decline in Bitcoin searches in Google is an indication of a lack of trader interest in digital coins. Bitcoin searches dipped almost 75% since the start of this year.  Tom Lee, on the other hand, believes that Google search trends aren’t a price performance indicator; saying “Google searches aren’t the leading indicator for Bitcoin, but instead, acts as a ‘coincident indicator,’ and therefore shouldn’t be looked to as some sort of BTC price predictor. Tom Lee admits that Bitcoin trading volume dropped 80% from December’s high. However, he says “December was the parabolic blow-off for Bitcoin.” He thinks such break out moments are always short-term and comparing trading volume to unusual trading activity isn’t a wise strategy for price prediction.  He said, “Compared to just the second half of last year, Bitcoin volumes are up forty percent. And compared to a year ago, [over] the same time (i.e., January to June), Bitcoin volumes are up nine hundred percent.”  Several stock market experts have been predicting a complete crash for Bitcoin and the rest of the digital currencies. They believe the lack of backing from real assets and regulatory pressures could kill cryptocurrency prices in the days to come. The huge price volatile also reduces its potential to work as a viable medium of exchange. Tom Lee has discarded these claims. He says – “Bitcoin mining cost will work as the floor in the case of a price crash. From the Bitcoin bear market in December 2013 to January 2015, Bitcoin bottomed at its mining cost.”    Featured Image: twitter"
1," Bitcoin (BTC) – Web searches for the word ‘Bitcoin’ have dropped around 75% since the beginning of 2018, according to Google Trends.  Source: GoogleTrends Google Trends analyzes different ‘periods of popularity’ for individual web searches. The value of ‘100’ on their site is given to a specific term that is being searched at its peak of popularity. Bitcoin (BTC) reached its all-time record high of $20,000 a coin in mid-December 2017 and has been dropping ever since. >> Bitcoin Price Manipulation? Bull or Bear? Before Tom Lee, Nick Colas was the first Wall Street analyst to cover Bitcoin back in 2013, and he is bearish on BTC at the moment. Colas spoke to CNBC yesterday and states that he has yet to see new adopters wanting to buy Bitcoin recently, and with any new technology new adopters make it more valuable. Colas gives to reasons as to why investors should halt on purchasing the cryptocurrency. First, google searches are down over 90% since Bitcoin’s peak in December and second, Bitcoin wallet growth has slowed down since last year. With that being said, Colas believes that the sharp drop in December and January was the crypto ‘bubble’ popping, but he’s a strong believer in its structure and technology. Negatives Across The Board Most top 10 cryptocurrencies reached their top search peaks on Google, back in the last weeks of 2017 and the first week of 2018. EOS is the only exception to this, as it reached its peak searches this past week as it launched its main net. Most searches for the cryptocurrency came from Nevada and Arizona, within the United States. Tron (TRX) launched its main net a week ago and barely received a spike in Google search traffic.

1," Both Bitcoin and initial coin offerings (ICOs) are showing signs of slowing down, experts claim. In the case of Bitcoin, Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, a provider of a market insight newsletter, found the correlation between the growth of the number of wallets and the cryptocurrency prices that says Bitcoin wallet growth needs to be +5% per month to see meaningful price appreciation, CNBC reported. However, wallet growth was roughly 2% percent in both April and May.  According to Colas, Bitcoin needs a new narrative in order to reestablish global attention. He added that, “This dog will have its day, but today isn't it. While we love the idea of Bitcoin (and own a little ourselves), we are not fans of buying it at current levels.”  Bitcoin price chart: Bitcoin prices have been struggling this year, especially compared to the all-time high in December. However, interest in Bitcoin is struggling too: Google searches for the term have dropped more than 75% since the beginning of this year and roughly halved over three months. Meanwhile, ICOs are struggling as well. Although the total for this year (USD 9.1 billion) already shot past the total for the entirety of 2017 (USD 6.6 billion), when removing EOS (USD 4.1 billion raised) and Telegram (USD 1.8 billion raised), the monthly trend look severely down. Research by Autonomous Next implies that this dragging is due to “continued regulatory uncertainty, tax overhang, and a lack of tangible progress in software adoption by the mainstream consumer.” However, the research firm goes on to say that we may be “entering the era of mega deals.” Japan is already moving forward with the crypto craze: from Rakuten, an e-commerce and Internet company, tokenizing USD 9 billion of loyalty points, to Mitsubishi bank talking about launching a cryptocurrency. And although last year, most of the projects were built by new teams, this year we are seeing a surge of mid-stage companies (50-250 employees) tokenizing some asset of their existing operations. This implies the possibility of late-stage companies entering the market soon as well, according to Autonomous Next. ""Just look at the Internet wave: March 2000 was the peak value share a percentage of market capitalizations. Despite the crash, the web has never been more present or important than today. Will crypto follow the same hype cycle curve?"" asks the research firm. "
1," Bitcoin price failed to hold the USD 7,600 support and corrected lower. BTC/USD is currently (GMT 08:40 AM) consolidating near the USD 7,400 support and is preparing for the next move. Similarly, major altcoins corrected lower and traded below a few key supports. The current price action suggests that the crypto market is in a consolidation phase, but remains in an uptrend. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price corrected lower from well above USD 7,700 and declined a few points below USD 7,400. However, BTC/USD managed to move back above the USD 7,400 support and is currently trading in a range.
The price has to surpass the USD 7,500 and USD 7,600 resistance levels to start a fresh upward wave. Should there be a downside move below USD 7,400, the price may revisit the next major support at USD 7,200 in the near term. Ethereum
Ethereum struggled to hold gains above USD 600 and broke the stated support. ETH/USD declined towards USD 575, which acted as a support and prevented further slides.
Going forward, if the price crawls back above the USD 600 pivot level, it could restart an upside move. Above USD 600, resistances are seen at USD 625 and USD 630. On the flip side, supports are at USD 580 and USD 575. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash declined by more than 3% and settled below USD 1,100. An immediate support is around USD 1,060, followed by USD 1,040. On the upside, BCH/USD has to trade above USD 1,100 and USD 1,120 to move back in a positive zone towards USD 1,180.
Ripple price did not decline much and remained around the USD 0.65 support. XRP/USD is facing hurdles on the upside near the USD 0.68 and USD 0.70 levels. On the downside, a break below USD 0.65 may perhaps push the price towards the USD 0.62 support.  Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, a few small cap altcoins traded with a bullish bias, including Huobi Token, Skycoin, CENNZ, BLX, BNB, CyberMiles and RChain. Overall, the current price action indicates ranging moves in the short term.  However, the next move depends on whether bitcoin price breaks the USD 7,500 - USD 7,600 resistance area or not. A continuous failure to move higher could ignite a bearish reaction in BTC and altcoins."
1," A major reprieve just may be in the offing for the battered bitcoin bulls in the next 36 hours – if, that is, historical patterns repeat themselves. Intriguingly, the cryptocurrency tends to take a significant change of direction on the sixth day of every month, or at least it has so far in 2018. Having topped out in the $20,000 neighborhood in mid-December 2017, the cryptocurrency fell to a 2018 low of $6,000 on Feb. 6. Since then, the cryptocurrency has been restricted to a narrowing price range, as indicated by the triangle pattern in the chart below. What’s more interesting is that major price highs and lows over that time have formed around the sixth day of every month.  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows: Clearly, the tide rebounds in favor of the weaker side on, or close to, the sixth day of every month. As of writing, bitcoin is trading at $7,433 on Bitfinex – down 34 percent from the bearish reversal point of $9,990, dated May 6, meaning the bulls are currently on the defensive. Going by the historical pattern, the cryptocurrency seems likely to turn higher in the next 36 hours or so. In this case, bitcoin could revisit triangle (narrowing price range) resistance, currently located at $9,225. On the other hand, long-term technical studies are biased to the bears, which was not the case on previous occasions. For instance, the cryptocurrency has found acceptance below the 50-week moving average for the first time since 2015. Further, a 5-month and 10-month moving average (MA) bearish crossover recently occurred for the first time in four years. So, as always, nothing is guaranteed when it comes to bitcoin price movements. But, just possibly, the cryptocurrency could pick up a strong bid tomorrow, in line with the historical pattern.  Even so, it would be too early to call a bull reversal, given the bearish long-term technical developments, and traders would want to see more evidence – such as a high volume break above the weekly high of $7,779 – before assuming the bulls were back in charge.

1," Bitcoin’s retreat from Sunday’s high of $7,779 has poured cold water over the bull mood generated by the weekend’s positive price action and neutralized the immediate outlook. BTC closed on Sunday (as per UTC) above a key falling trendline resistance level, signaling a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change. A bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving average (MA) also favored a short-term positive price action. However, bitcoin suffered a rising wedge breakdown (bearish pattern) in the U.S. hours on Monday, signaling that the corrective rally from the recent low of $7,040 had ended. In the end, the failed breakout was no surprise, as low trading volumes had warned of a bull trap. At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at a four-day low of $7,426 on Bitfinex, down 2.5 percent over 24 hours.  The above chart shows that bitcoin is back inside a falling channel and risks a quick drop to $6,980 (triangle support) if the bulls fail to defend the support at $7,260 (May 24 low). Further, the rising-wedge breakdown as seen in the 4-hour chart below, also indicates the corrective rally has ended and prices could soon revisit the recent low of $7,040.  Still, the overall outlook may be more neutral, with bitcoin creating a doji candle on the 4-hour chart above, signaling indecision in the marketplace. If the current 4-hour candle closes below $7,732, it could bolster the already bearish technicals (failed breakout). Meanwhile, if the current 4-hour candle closes above $7,500, bitcoin could revisit $7,700. Tug-of-war image via Shutterstock"
0," Is Bitcoin (BTC) a real asset or bubble? This question is a continuous discussion. Economists and market pundits have been closely watching Bitcoin mania; some of them are comparing it to teh Dutch Golden Age Tulip Mania, while a few are showing confidence in its future fundamentals. The debate over the shocking Bitcoin price movement and its ability to exist for the long-term hasn’t settled up. Until now. Joost van der Burgt, policy advisor at Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, however, believes that Bitcoin is a bubble which is close to bursting. The advisor has explicitly explained his thesis using five key indicators: The market has already crossed the first three stages of the cycle as the economist thinks the Bitcoin bubble is currently in the fourth stage of the cycle. He claims the displacement stage started occurring during the early age of Bitcoin – which then changed into the boom phase last year. Explaining the boom period, he said, “The ‘boom’ phase is characterized by prices rising slowly at first, but then gaining momentum as more and more participants enter the market, fearful of missing out.” The advisor further believes that the rush of entering the market has forced traders to borrow money to finance their investments. He calls it “Euphoria” (stage three of the cycle) – which he believes occurred together with the boom stage. The market has already entered the profit-taking stage according to Joost van der Burgt. He says the massive selloff in Bitcoin price indicates that investors are capitalizing on gains that Bitcoin generated during the last year.  Bitcoin price is down almost 60% from the all-time high amid traders selling strategy. He further predicts that the market is likely to enter the final stage soon; saying “The subsequent ‘panic’ phase, should it come to that, commences when reality sets in and Bitcoin’s price would substantially crash.” >>Bitcoin Cash Price Watch – BCH/USD Holds Steady Around $1,100 The economist, however, confesses that his thesis might not be accurate and Bitcoin could become the real asset or global currency in future. He said, “Maybe Bitcoin is different than anything we have seen before, and maybe a decade from now its market capitalization will be sky-high as it attains the status of a new global currency.” What are your thoughts? Would you err on the side of caution with an analysis such as this? Or is his thesis reflected accurately in the coins performance? Let us know below! Featured Image: twitter"
0," There were decent gains in bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies during the past two days. The best part was a close above the USD 7,500 pivot level in BTC/USD, opening the doors for more upsides. Ethereum also broke the USD 600 barrier and traded above USD 625. At the moment, prices are correcting lower, but approaching important weekly support levels. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price broke the USD 7,500 level and traded towards USD 7,750 where sellers appeared. BTC/USD started a downside correction, but the previous resistance at USD 7,500 is now likely to act as a strong support.
Looking at the higher timeframe charts, the price is placed nicely in a bullish zone with weekly supports at USD 7,500, USD 7,400 and USD 7,250. On the upside, bitcoin buyers are facing major barriers near the USD 7,800 and USD 8,000 levels. Above this last, the price may perhaps move towards USD 8,500. Ethereum
Ethereum performed really well and broke a crucial resistance at USD 600. ETH/USD traded close to the USD 640 level before correcting 3% to USD 605. The pair must hold the USD 600 and USD 580 support levels to stay in the bullish zone. 
Below USD 580, the next major weekly support sits at USD 520. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near USD 630 - USD 640. A push above USD 640 could take the price towards the next key resistance at USD 690. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price broke the USD 1,100 resistance and even cleared the USD 1,200 level before sellers took a stand. BCH/USD corrected lower and moved below USD 1,150. It is currently down 1% to USD 1,125, with weekly supports at USD 1,100 and USD 1,040. Resistances are at USD 1,200 and USD 1,250.
Ripple also gained bullish momentum and settled above the USD 0.65 resistance. As long as the XRP/USD pair is above the USD 0.62, it remains in an uptrend towards USD 0.70 and USD 0.75. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins traded higher recently, but most of them are correcting lower today. A few altcoins to watch out this week are VeChain, Mixin, Tron, EOS, Bancor, Golem, Polymath and BNB. The overall price structure is positive and if bitcoin accelerates gain above USD 7,800, there could be further upsides above USD 8,000 during the upcoming days."
0," Bitcoin looks primed for a move to $8,000, but low trading volumes point to the risk of a bull trap. The cryptocurrency broke through a key descending trendline (drawn through the May 6 high to the May 21 high) on Sunday, adding credence to last Tuesday’s bullish outside-day candle and signaling a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change. However, at the same time, daily trading volume fell 1.77 percent to $4.85 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Further, rolling 24-hour trading volume currently stands at $4.95 billion – down 22.5 percent from the current quarterly average of $6.38 billion. Low volume is a cause for concern for the bulls, as it is widely considered a sign that the market is approaching a peak; that is, the rally will be short-lived. Hence, a slight pullback seen today does not come as a surprise. At time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,591 on Bitfinex – down 2 percent from the previous day’s (UTC) close of $7,718.  The bullish outside-day candle followed by a bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs), and an upside break of the falling trendline, indicate scope for a rally to $8,000. However, the decline in trading volume over the last seven days puts a question market on the sustainability of the corrective rally from $7,040 (May 29 low) to $7,779 (Sunday’s high).  On the 4-hour chart, trading volume has picked up as prices fell back to $7,549 from the high of $7,764. The anemic trading volume during the price rally and the later increase in trading volume during negative price action indicates a high probability of a downside break of the rising wedge pattern. In such a case, bitcoin risks falling back to last week’s low of $7,040. Trapped businessman image via Shutterstock"
1," Bitcoin Buying Opportunity?: Has Bitcoin price reached the bottom of the recent bearish cycle? Market pundits were predicting that Bitcoin price had hit the bottom of the bear run earlier this week when the coin traded at around the $7,000 level; saying the cryptocurrency markets are undervalued following the most recent selloff.    Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Buying during the dip and selling during the high has always been considered a smart investing strategy and Dan Morehead –founder of Pantera Capital Management, is a current advocate of this practice: “All cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now. It’s much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes,” Morehead said Thursday on “Fast Money.” Bitcoin Buying Opportunity? Why Does Dan Morehead Anticipate a Rally? Bitcoin price and the rest of digital currencies have posted significant losses in the last three consecutive weeks. The selloff has pulled the total cryptocurrency market close to $300 billion, down more than 60% from the all-time-high it achieved at the beginning of the year.  The founder of Pantera Capital Management says that the market has reached the bottom of this year. He anticipates upcoming investments from Wall Street will push the prices higher in the next couple of quarters. “Many institutions are essentially buying the rumor [of potential SEC regulations] and selling the fact,” he said. “Getting invested now so that in three, four, five months when the institutional, quality-regulated custodians that we’re hearing about come online, they’ll already have their positions.” >>Mount Everest Crypto Stunt – the Craziest Thing to Happen in Crypto in May!  Source Image: twitter.com Cryptocurrency markets have been under pressure over the last few months amid regulatory concerns and huge price volatility. Technical analysts, on the other hand, are now expecting some bullish momentum in Bitcoin price. Although Twitter users mostly agree with Dan Morehead’s thesis that the market has hit bottom, they aren’t yet sure how significant this bullish trend could be.

1," Bitcoin price stayed above the USD 7,400 support area during the past three sessions and it mostly consolidated in a range. However, BTC/USD seems to be facing a tough challenge near the USD 7,600 and USD 7,650 resistance levels. On the other hand, altcoins are slowly moving higher and many major cryptocurrencies are poised to break key resistance levels, including Ethereum and ADA. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price remained confined in a range below the USD 7,600 and USD 7,650 resistance levels (GMT 09:00). A successful break and close above USD 7,620 - USD 7,650 is needed for additional gains towards USD 8,000 in the near term.
On the downside, the USD 7,400 level is a crucial support. As long as BTC/USD is above USD 7,400, the pair remains in an uptrend. Should there be a downside break below USD 7,400, the price may move back in a bearish zone to test the USD 7,250 and USD 7,000 support levels. Ethereum
Ethereum is grinding higher and is currently up around 2.8% to USD 585. It seems like the ETH/USD pair may continue to move higher and it could accelerate gains above the USD 600 barrier.
On the flip side, if there is no upside break above USD 600, the price could correct lower. Supports on the downside are seen near USD 560 and USD 550. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is flirting with the USD 1,000 handle. The BCH/USD pair struggled to move above the USD 1,040 resistance, but at the same time, it held the USD 960 support. It seems like the pair might trade in a range for a few more hours before the next break either above USD 1,040 or below USD 960. Ripple price is gaining upside momentum and is currently up 1.5% to USD 0.615. On the upside, XRP/USD is facing resistances near USD 0.62 and USD 0.625. A break above these could push the price towards USD 0.64.  Other Altcoins Market Today
The overall altcoins market is trading in the green zone and if sentiment improves further, there could be more gains. Today, coins such as IOTA, VERI, HT, Ontology, BNB, Bitcoin Private, KNC and NAS gained bullish traction and moved higher between 8-15%. To sum up, bitcoin is placed nicely in a bullish zone, but it must break the USD 7,600 barrier to continue moving higher."
1," Looking at a chart and calling Bitcoin a bubble is a favorite pastime of crypto skeptics - they may even forego the chart and just call it a bubble off the top of their heads. However, economists understand that bubbles are complex things that can’t be recognized without fail before they pop.  According to US economist Hyman Minsky, a bubble has five stages: displacement, boom, euphoria, profit-taking, and panic. If Bitcoin is a bubble, it is at the profit-taking stage with the panic stage just around the corner, Joost van der Burgt, a policy adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, wrote in a recent paper called ""Making Sense of Bitcoin Price Levels"". The displacement phase was after the release of the coin’s whitepaper in 2008, according to him. Back then, very few people knew about Bitcoin, and trading volume and price were small - the first time Bitcoin broke through USD 100 was in 2013, four years after its inception. Van der Burgt writes that the next stage, the boom, was obvious: “The subsequent ‘boom’ phase is characterized by prices rising slowly at first, but then gaining momentum as more and more participants enter the market, fearful of missing out.” Euphoria comes with the hype remaining even as the prices lose their volatility: “The euphoria phase is also when people start to borrow extensively to finance their investments. According to a recent survey, 18% of active bitcoin investors have financed their investments by credit card, and 22% of this group indicated that they have not yet paid off their credit card balance,” he explains. This means now is the profit-taking stage, where savvy investors leave, preparing the ground for the panic stage which would see prices crashing. It may not come to pass after all, however: “Then again, maybe bitcoin is different than anything we have seen before, and maybe a decade from now its market capitalization will be sky-high as it attains the status of a new global currency.” Bubble stages: Bitcoin price chart: Meanwhile, Dan Morehead, founder of Pantera Capital Management, a crypto investment firm, told CNBC that ""all cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now"" and encouraged to buy now and ""participate in the rally as it goes""."
1," A long-term price indicator has turned bearish for the first time in four years, threatening to impede continued gains in bitcoin’s price. Despite the rally late in the month, the cryptocurrency dropped 19 percent in May, according to Bitfinex data, pushing the 5-month moving average (MA) below the 10-month moving average for the first time since June 2014. The bearish moving average crossover validates the argument that long-term bull market has ended and indicates scope for further losses. The monthly chart also shows BTC fell below $7,698 – the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $162 (2015 low) to $19,891 (2017 high) – last month, bolstering the already bearish technical setup. However, the 4-hour chart is distinctly more bullish, indicating that gains could continue in the short-term.  Going strictly by the monthly chart, BTC could drop to the immediate support of $6,000 (February low) and possibly extend the decline further towards $4,384 (78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement). However, bitcoin had to drop 19 percent in May to push the 5-month MA below the 10-month MA. So, it’s likely the bears have run out of steam, at least for the short-term. Thus, a corrective rally could be in the offing before the bearish effect of the long-term moving average crossover is felt. Indeed, the short duration chart does show a scope for a rally to $7,800.  Bitcoin created another higher low (bullish pattern) as it recovered from the low of $7,414 yesterday. The 50-candle MA has now shed bearish bias) and the RSI is above 50.00 (bullish territory) and rising. The price action, when viewed against the backdrop of Tuesday’s bullish outside-day candle and the bullish price-RSI divergence, indicates scope for a rally to $7,818 (falling trendline resistance).

1," Mining hardware giant Bitmain has been criticized over one of its latest mining products, the AntMiner B3, with Chinese users making allegations about its marketing tactics and quality control. According to a blog post from the AntMiner’s official WeChat account, the new product – dedicated to mining BTM, the native token of the Bytom blockchain – was launched on April 25, one day after the Bytom team launched its mainnet. Priced at 17,000 Chinese yuan (or $2,600) per unit, the first batch of 25,000 B3 miners was notably sold out in seconds after commencement of the sale. While the AntMiner B3’s official specifications tout a computing power of 750 hashes per second, complaints from the first batch of buyers in China soon emerged, alleging that Bitmain had significantly exaggerated the product’s power capability in its marketing. According to a local news source, the dispute arose after an initial test by miners in China said the AntMiner B3 can only produce 500–600 hashes per second, a difference that critically reduces their calculated profits from an 47 BTM per day to as low as single digit production. As more complaints have emerged in the local community over the past several weeks, miners have moved to form groups on social messaging app WeChat and have shared their findings on the mining device on Chinese Q&A site Zhihu. Other allegations that have since then been circulating over the social media include suspicions that Bitmain is using secondhand components to manufacture the B3. According to one post on Zhihu, users commented that the fan of their supposed brand new AntMiner B3 was covered with dust, which could potentially explain the reported weak computing performance. Subsequently, a dedicated Weibo account that claims to protect the rights of the B3 buyers was also created on May 19, in a bid to demand refunds from the mining giant. According to a post from the activists’ Weibo page, a group of B3 purchasers visited Bitmain’s office in Beijing on Monday to discuss a solution to the issue. While the group apparently comprised of fewer than 10 people, the meeting saw local policemen present to ensure the conversation was peaceful. Based on a news report from Sina, miners from the group said Bitmain expressed willingness to fix products that have hashing power issues, but would not consider refunding customers. The firm is instead open to the idea of resolving the matter through the legal process, as per the report. While Bitmain has yet to respond to CoinDesk’s enquiry for further comment, the company was quoted in another local news report Thursday conceding there are problems with some B3s. However, Bitmain clarified that devices with issues only represent one percent of production so far, based on its internal investigations. The company also denied the accusation that it was selling secondhand products. In response to the accusation that it exaggerated the specs of the mining machine in its marketing, Bitmain commented: “Mining machines are in essence investment products … The profit and the price of the token adjust based on the market dynamics. As such nothing could guaranteed by any company or any individual.” Miners image via Shutterstock"
1," Bitcoin (BTC) will eventually die: Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller gave interesting but pessimistic remarks which shatter Bitcoin’s price fundamentals. The Bitcoin price bull-run seems to have paused after increasing skepticism from economist and technical analysts; they continue revealing bearish outlooks for Bitcoin in both the short and the long-run.   Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Robert Shiller – who is a famous economist and early predictor of both the dot-com bubble and the housing crash, has revealed that Bitcoin will eventually die either in the next few quarters or a hundred years from now. He thinks that Bitcoin is akin to all other monetary forms that failed after being short lived. “Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work. That mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal.” Shiller wrote The Economist has presented two compelling and meaningful scenarios for the world’s leading cryptocurrency.  The first scenario is Bitcoin could change its entity entirely if it exists 100 years from now. Shiller believes that increasing innovations in blockchain technologies and digital coins could completely change its existing features in the following decades. “Bitcoin won’t look anything like it is today. It will have a different name, if it exists,” Shiller said Tuesday on CNBC’s. Bitcoin price could crash significantly in the short-term, according to Robert Shiller’s second scenario. He thinks Bitcoin price could lose 80% of its value in the coming days, as its charm is fading away and people are starting to ignore it.   Source Image: twitter.com Like many other big names in the global financial sphere, Robert Shiller also calls Bitcoin a “Bubble”, meaning it will eventually have a bad ending. The response to Shiller’s claim was mixed. Bulls, however, doesn’t believe in Shiller’s theory. They claim the economist’s theory is too vague considering the requirement of a long time-frame. Bulls also want more explanation regarding the factors that could kill Bitcoin price by 80% in the short-term.   Featured Image: Twitter"
1," The past few sessions were mostly bullish for bitcoin and altcoins. BTC/USD corrected a few points yesterday, but the decline was well protected by buyers. Bitcoin price is now back above the USD 7,400 level and is currently trading in a bullish zone. Similarly, there was a minor correction in altcoins such as ethereum, bitcoin cash, ripple and ADA, but prices recovered from key support levels. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price corrected lower and tested the USD 7,300 support area. Later, BTC/USD bounced back and is currently trading above the USD 7,500 level (GMT 09:00 AM). On the upside, an initial resistance sits at USD 7,600, followed by USD 7,620.
A successful break above USD 7,620 will most likely open the doors for a test of USD 8,000. On the downside, the USD 7,400 level is an important support. Below this, the price may perhaps retest the USD 7,300 and USD 7,250 support levels. Ethereum
Ethereum completed a downside correction and is currently trading 1.5% higher to USD 570. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 580, above which the price could accelerate above USD 600.
On the downside, the USD 550 level is an important support levels. As long as ETH/USD is placed above the USD 550 level, it may perhaps continue to move higher. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is holding gains above the USD 1,000 level, which is a positive sign. On the upside, the USD 1,020 and USD 1,040 are key barriers for more gains before BCH/USD makes an attempt to break USD 1,080. On the downside, the USD 980 and USD 960 levels are decent supports.
Ripple price is also holding gains above an important level at USD 0.60. XRP/USD is facing hurdles near the USD 0.62 level, above which the price could move towards the USD 0.64 level.  Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, Golem and BNB gained around 14% and 12% respectively. GNT broke the USD 0.60 resistance, and BNB price surged above the USD 14 level.
The overall price structure is positive as long as bitcoin price is above USD 7,250. Additionally, if buyers succeed in pushing the price above USD 7,620, it could increase bullish pressure and BTC/USD might rally towards USD 8,000."
1," “Something good may come out of this,” Nobel-winning economist and Yale professor Robert Shiller said when asked about cryptocurrencies in a recent interview with CNBC.  Also, he stressed that Bitcoin is not a bad thing: “I don’t mean to be dismissive of Bitcoin. It looks like a bubble, but it’s getting people enthusiastic and they’re making different kinds of cryptocurrencies.” However, in his opinion, Bitcoin might fade away, be renamed and go through many hard forks, and might turn out to be a bubble. “Bitcoin won't look anything like it is today. It will have a different name, if it exists. There will have been many hard forks, changing it and changing it. And, it'll be a matter of dispute whether it exists or not.” When asked whether his students are interested in cryptocurrencies, he laughs and says yes. One even asked him if he could keep his laptop open during a final exam to complete a trade, and he let him as it showed true enthusiasm. At the end 2017, Shiller stated his certainty that Bitcoin will collapse: “Bitcoin, it’s just absolutely exciting ( …) You’re fast. You’re smart. You’ve figured out nobody else understands. You’re with it. And Bitcoin has this anti-government, anti-regulation feel. It’s such a wonderful story. If it were only true.”  Here is what six Nobel laureate economists have to say about crypto."
1," Bitcoin (BTC) is working its way through the key supply zone above $7,500 and could test resistance at $7,870 in the next 24 hours, the technical charts indicate. The cryptocurrency looked primed for a corrective rally yesterday, having created a bullish outside-day candle on Tuesday. However, the bulls had a tough time absorbing supply around 50-candle moving average (MA) on the 4-hour chart, located yesterday at $7,550. The repeated failure to beat the moving average hurdle ended in a downside break of the diamond pattern. The subsequent sell-off ran out of steam at $7,270, and led to a convincing move above the 50-candle MA, seen today at $7,441. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,535 on Bitfinex, up 0.6 percent over 24 hours, and looks set to test the falling trendline resistance located at $7,870.  The recovery from $7,270 to $7,570 has established a higher low (bullish pattern), which adds credence to Tuesday’s bullish outside-day candle and bullish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence. Hence, BTC could test supply around $7,870 – resistance of trendline sloping downwards from the May 6 high and May 21 high. It also means the cryptocurrency will likely peep above the all-important 50-week MA, currently located at $7,711. However, only a weekly close (Sunday’s close as per UTC) above that level would signal bearish invalidation. Weekly chart  As seen in the chart above, the last weekly candle had closed below the 50-week MA for the first time since October 2015, in theory indicating the end of the long-term bull run. Despite the bullish set up, there is merit in being cautious as the major moving averages – 50, 100 and 200 – on the 4-hour chart are also biased to the bears, as is the 10-day MA.

0," The substantial amount of volatility in Bitcoin price (BTC) is arguably the biggest factor hindering its potential for global acceptability. Retailers, restaurants, and even credit card companies refuse to support cryptocurrencies due to this price volatility. As a more-than-apt example, the cryptocurrency market cap gained $30 billion in the last twenty-four hours alone, after wiping off $150 billion in the previous three weeks.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Important investment figures such as Warren Buffett have refused to invest in cryptocurrencies due to the speculation surrounding price movement. Fed Officials and other influentials have also rejected Bitcoin’s potential to work as a viable medium of exchange, as it has no backing from real assets and is, as previously mentioned – very volatile.   Mr. Greenspan, a senior market analyst at eToro, believes Bitcoin price could take decades to achieve complete stabilization. Mr. Greenspan said: “I don’t think the volatility is going to go away any time soon, especially since we still have a lot of bitcoin ‘whales’ or people who are involved in bitcoin early on who have amounted a massive amount stockpile.  Source Image: twitter.com Market participants, on the other hand, are also blaming regulators for the price volatility. They believe regulators could kill the price volatility if they imposed hard rules that reduce unfair practices and price manipulation activities. But then the point of crypto was to be decentralized, so is this not a complete contradiction? Wasn’t an ideology of “no regulation” part of the thrill of Bitcoin? Combined with price volatility, increasing competition from other market players, including Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ripple (XRP) is making it hard for Bitcoin to achieve global acceptability. Answering the question of “how long Bitcoin price takes for complete stabilization?”, Mr Greenspan said, “Over time, if we are looking at decades into the future, once the adoption rate of bitcoin is normal and has reached full market penetration, which we are nowhere near at the moment, and once you see more distribution and more liquidity in the market, I believe we can then have a much more stable price fluctuation,” Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Tzido"
0," Yesterday, we discussed that bitcoin and altcoins are trading near crucial support levels. BTC/USD formed a key bottom above the USD 7,000 level and surged higher by more than USD 400. Similarly, other major cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash bounced back sharply and are currently trading in a bullish zone. The current market sentiment is positive, signaling more gains in the short term. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price surged higher and broke the USD 7,250 and USD 7,400 resistance levels. BTC/USD is currently up by 5.2% to USD 7,500 (GMT 9:00 AM), with an immediate resistance at USD 7,540. Above this, the price must break the USD 7,600 barrier for more gains in the near term.
On the downside, the broken supports at USD 7,400 and USD 7,250 are likely to act as supports if the price corrects lower. Below USD 7,250, the price could move back in the bearish zone towards USD 7,000. Ethereum
Ethereum price also formed a solid support near USD 500 and started an upward move. It traded up by more than USD 50 and tested the USD 570 resistance.
ETH/USD is currently up by 7.5% to USD 560, with an immediate resistance at USD 570. A break above this could open the doors for a push towards the all-important USD 600 resistance. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash moved back above the USD 1,000 level and it is currently up by 11.2%. If BCH/USD manages to hold the USD 1,000 level, there may well be more upsides towards the USD 1,050 level. On the downside, supports are at USD 960 and USD 940.
Ripple price rallied and moved above the USD 0.60 hurdle. XRP/USD is up by 9.5% to USD 0.609 and it looks set to extend the current rally towards the USD 0.62 and USD 0.65 in the near term.  Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap coins rallied during the past three sessions, including BCN, THETA, 0x, MITH, Augur, ICON, Kin, Golem, IOTA, Fusion and GXS. BCN performed very well and gained more than 25%.  The current price action suggests that bitcoin and many altcoins bounced back from key supports. Should BTC/USD accelerate above USD 7,550, there may perhaps be an extended rally towards USD 8,000."
0," Bitcoin’s (BTC) bulls have staged a defense after nearly a month of losses, but a short-term bullish trend reversal is not yet confirmed, the technical charts indicate. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is up 5 percent at $7,487 on Bitfinex, having clocked a four-day high of $7,560 earlier today. A minor corrective rally had been expected, courtesy of a bullish price-relative strength index divergence in the short duration charts seen over the last two days. Further, the resulting bullish outside-day candle engulfed the price action seen on Monday and Tuesday, and has neutralized the immediate bearish outlook.  As the name suggests, the bullish outside-day indicates a bearish-to-bullish trend change. However, analysts and traders usually wait for confirmation – positive follow-through before calling a reversal. So, a short-term bullish trend reversal would be confirmed if bitcoin takes out the descending (bearish) 10-day moving average (MA) hurdle in a convincing manner. Currently, the 10-day MA is located at $7,562 and is capping the upside in prices, as seen in the chart above. Meanwhile, the 50-candle MA hurdle in the 4-hour chart below is also proving a tough nut to crack.  A high volume break above the 50-candle MA of $7,520 could see bitcoin attack the descending trendline hurdle, currently located at $7,930. That said, prices will likely revisit $7,100 if bulls are unable to cross the key moving average hurdle in the next few hours. The chart also shows the major moving averages (50,100 and 200) are trending south, a lingering bearish setup. So, a convincing break above the 50-candle MA will be easier said than done.

0," Scammers are a nuisance. Perhaps nowhere else within the cryptocurrency space have scammers become more frustrating than on crypto Twitter. The social media site has been overtaken with accounts impersonating notable figures and businesses promising tens of thousands of bitcoin or ether or XRP, in return for users merely sending a small amount of a cryptocurrency to their accounts in return. While it might seem intuitive that these giveaways are suspect, the fraudsters are playing to people’s FOMO (fear of missing out), but also the language and cultural barriers that exist within the diverse, global community. Indeed, crypto aficionados of all kinds – not just the most prominent founders, but also low-profile developers and newly announced ICO issuers and nearly everyone in between – wake up every morning, scouring their Twitter accounts and reporting the abuse to the social networking giant. Yet, it seems there isn’t an easy way to stop the shakedowns. It’s led many crypto visionaries to go about getting Twitter’s blue check mark, a sign that an account has been verified and is therefore supposedly more legitimate. But even that has proved manipulable. Airing frustration towards the chaos that crypto Twitter has devolved into, a well-known cryptocurrency advocate known as Thomas ‘Mad Bitcoins’ Hunt tweeted: “Your system is broken. Allowing users to choose the same name and image as other users is a mistake that leads to fraud. Change your system. End this fraud.” But still the chaos has continued (if not gotten worse), and many crypto enthusiasts are deciding if you can’t beat ’em, you might as well laugh at ’em. As such, they’re tweeting out the most egregious interplay between themselves and the scammers, and sometimes one con man to the next. The instances of impersonation have gotten so bad, that many crypto visionaries have added language to their profiles stating “[Not giving away ETH/BTC]” – as if it was their middle names. But, although it could seem counterintuitive, as these fraudsters merely copy and paste the name and image onto their scam accounts, that language too has carried over. Generally, these accounts comment their giveway images under a post from the real person they’re trying to impersonate, hoping to prey off users that aren’t looking closely at the handles, which at times are only one letter off from the originals. And as scammers have become more sophisticated, they’ve taken to blocking the person they’re trying to impersonate, so that that person can’t see their posts, report it and get shut down by Twitter.  Just like the scammers above try to confuse users by putting their fake posts side-by-side the people they’re impersonating, other scammers have jumped on posts where many people are mentioned. Recently, South African crypto exchange, iceCUBED, tweeted out a list of crypto notables for what has become known as “Follow Fridays” – whereby a user tweets out people that their followers should follow. I was featured alongside folks like monero lead maintainer Riccardo Spagni, Lightning Labs founder Elizabeth Spark and litecoin creator Charlie Lee (I know, I’m not worthy). Right under that post, though, another user by the same name, but with a different handle, posted about an ETH giveaway. And in that way, some unsuspecting users could think that not only the exchange but also the people tagged in the post support the promotion.  While journalists might seem strange characters to impersonate (especially since I’ve written about not being a crypto millionaire), it has become a popular move since they typically have significant followings of users of all skill levels, including newbs to the cryptocurrency scene who might not be well-versed on the state of the industry. Another way scammers (whose accounts generally have only a couple followers and whose only tweets are the ones about the giveaways) are trying to trick users is by creating more personal accounts. For instance, a Twitter user named Dennis Parker was recently impersonated. The account copied and pasted his name and picture but the bio was very different. Whereas the real Dennis Parker’s bio just says, “Bitcoin Maximalist,” the scam account (which was still active at the time of this writing) says, “Foodie, Editor, Water Protector, Wine Connoisseur, Unwashed Mass. I own 25 hoolahoops.” As Parker tweeted: “My scam accounts are getting personal.” Not only that, but scammers have also gone to other lengths to try and bilk users out of their crypto. Notable venture capital investor Tim Draper tweeted about one of his impersonators asking his followers for funds in exchange for mining bitcoin for them. Most people in the crypto scene know Neeraj Agrawal, the communication lead at Washington D.C.-based lobbying group Coin Center and also a meme god on crypto Twitter. Lesser-known is NeerajKAgrawal7, who recently replied to an offering of ETH with one word – “scam.” While that might not seem particularly surprising, what’s absurd is that the response came from one of Agrawal’s imposters, not Agrawal himself. As Agrawal tweeted, “My ether scammer is calling out other ether scammers.”  In a similar instance, an account posing as Bruce Fenton (the thought leader and investor in the cryptocurrency space who founded Satoshi Roundtable) commented with its own crypto giveaway on the giveaway post from a fake Mad Bitcoins. Speaking to the event, Mad Bitcoins tweeted: “It’s a beautiful cycle of spam Twitter and you should make it stop!” As mentioned above, many of the most acclaimed people in the cryptocurrency space deal with insane amounts of scam accounts. Case in point, Charlie Shrem, the founder of now-defunct early bitcoin exchange BitInstant and now an adviser for several blockchain projects, tweeted recently about all the scam accounts under his name. He said: “I do give away stuff from time to time, but will never ask you to send me something first.” The tweet was accompanied by images which display just how rampant the scam accounts have become.  Another crypto character that gets impersonated quite a bit is John McAfee, who became famous after launching the popular anti-virus software and is now promoting ICOs on Twitter for a fee. Yet, many crypto enthusiasts might not sympathize with McAfee since they see his new “job” as dubious. In fact, McAfee’s latest ICO-promoting tweet featured Pink Taxi Coin, a dubious ICO project with a plagiarized white paper and website, among other red flags. While these impersonators have become a scourge on crypto Twitter, some have taken to joking about how having a scammer impersonate them is a way to display that they’re popular. A prominent parody account in the space, Swift on Security, said, after a fraudster impersonated the account, “I’ve made it. I’ve finally made it.” As such, Kevin Pham, who became a staple of crypto Twitter this year, tweeted (after being impersonated): “Fuck blue checks. Having a scam account is the free market signalling you’re a somebody on Crypto Twitter!”  Magic trick image via Shutterstock"
1," Investors all over the world had credited Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital currencies highly, thanks predominantly to their backing from innovative blockchain technologies and the possibility to work as a viable currency. Market dynamic and investor sentiments have changed substantially however in the past few months; cryptocurrency mania now seems to be cooling down – despite a much higher adaptation than ever before for blockchain technology. Google Trends, for instance, shows a vast and constant decline of public interest in Bitcoin and other emerging cryptocurrencies. This is mainly due to the massive level of volatility in cryptocurrency markets. The speculation based price movement has also erased trader’s interest.  The BTC coin rose to an all-time high of $19,000 level at the beginning of the year before crashing to $6,000 on Feb 6. It continued the huge sideways moves in the following months. BTC price moved sharply higher earlier this month to around $9,900 before losing all the gains in last three consecutive weeks. The study from UK’s Warwick Business School, which is ranked at the first spot in the Financial Times online MBA program in 2018, shows that cryptocurrencies are not reliable saving instruments, even in the short-term. The demand is driven by past prices, or simple emotion, rather than by economic fundamentals, according to UK’s Warwick Business School findings.  Several researchers and market analysts are comparing Bitcoin and other digital currencies with the dot-com bubble. The only handful of internet companies had survived when the internet bubble burst in 2000. The study further reveals only a few cryptocurrencies will survive in the long-term, and it is difficult to tell which one would be the next Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Featured Image: twitter"
1," In a decentralized system, where no individual or group holds the majority of power, the only way to seize control is to gain a majority of like-minded individuals. This is the origin of the 51% attack - where the system needs a majority vote to reach consensus. Although a 51% attack in a large distributed network, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum etc. is highly unlikely due to sheer size, smaller coins face a bigger risk simply because there are fewer participants, which makes it easier to manipulate. This is why the website crypto51 was made: a collection of coins and the theoretical cost of a 51% attack on each network, it is not meant to encourage attacks, but to get people talking about the problem and potential solutions. As to how it works, the website explains: “Using the prices NiceHash [a Slovenian cryptocurrency cloud mining marketplace] lists for different algorithms we are able to calculate how much it would cost to rent enough hashing power to match the current network hashing power for an hour.”  Bytecoin is an example of 51% attack potential: with a market cap of around USD 1 billion, it can be 51% attacked for only USD 557, according to the website. While hackers targeting coins such as Bata, Startcoin, Halcyon and some others would require only a few bucks to attack these networks. Since NiceHash doesn’t have the hashing power for larger coins, the website also lists the percentage of the needed hashing power that is available from Nicehash. The attack cost does not include the block rewards that the miner will receive for mining. In either case, recently there have been a number of 51% attacks including attacks on Verge and Bitcoin Gold.  Also, there was in fact a moment, in 2014, when the mining pool Ghash.io came close to obtaining 51% of the whole Bitcoin network. But then some members of the pool voluntary left, decreasing its share. Still, Bitcoin experts believe a 51% attack is very unlikely as its cost would exceed the possible benefits and it would most likely hurt the very attacker. Moreover, such an attack can’t be used to steal bitcoins or change older transactions, as the attacker would be only able to double spend his/hers funds from a recent transaction. Also, any attack would only last for a short time before being quickly fixed by the Bitcoin community.  Bitcoin evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos on 51% Bitcoin attack:"
1," Yesterday, we discussed that bitcoin could trade to new lows below USD 7,250. BTC/USD did trade lower and almost tested the USD 7,000 support. Other major cryptocurrencies also followed bitcoin and moved further into the red zone. Looking at the charts, it seems like bitcoin, ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin and ADA are trading near important support levels. Therefore, both scenarios are possible: prices decline further and clear crucial supports or buyers jump into action and a fresh upward recovery is initiated. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently trading above the USD 7,000 (GMT 08:45 AM) support in a tight range. It seems like BTC/USD is consolidating losses and is preparing for the next move. Should there be a bearish break below USD 7,000, the price may perhaps drop to USD 6,500.
On the flip side, if buyers take the stage, bitcoin price could recover towards the USD 7,500 resistance. A successful break above the USD 7,500 resistance is needed for buyers to take control. Ethereum
Ethereum price is also trading near a key support level at USD 500. ETH/USD must hold the stated support to avoid a crash towards USD 450. 
On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 540, above which the price may perhaps make an attempt to move above the USD 580 and USD 600 resistance levels. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is currently trading near the USD 880 - USD 900 support. If BCH/USD fails to recover from the current levels, it may possibly decline further towards the USD 800 handle. Alternatively, a recovery could take the pair towards the USD 1,000 barrier.
Ripple price declined further and tested an important support at USD 0.55. Should there be a daily close below USD 0.55, XRP/USD might drop towards the USD 0.50 support in the near term.  Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, Dropil, CryberMiles, MYB and GXS managed to gain traction and registered gains more than 10%. Other small cap altcoins remained in a bearish zone, including Nano, Fusion, EOS, Litecoin, Stellar, TRON, IOTA, NEO and Monero. The current technical structure is suggesting a consolidation phase in the short term. However, a downside break below USD 7,000 in bitcoin could put a lot of pressure on buyers."
1," Concerns over high price volatility have prompted prosecutors in Germany to make an emergency sale of seized cryptocurrencies worth over €12 million (around $14 million). Local news source Der Tagesspiegel reported Monday that Bavarian prosecutors ordered the sale on Feb. 20. At the time, bitcoin’s price had rebounded to nearly $10,000 after hitting a yearly low of $5,947 on Feb. 6, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Taking nearly two months to complete, the sale reportedly disposed of 1,312 bitcoins, 1,399 bitcoin cash, 1,312 bitcoin gold and 220 ether via over 1,600 transactions on a German trading platform. The cryptocurrencies were all seized during two ongoing investigations being conducted by Bavarian cybercrime agencies. Although the prosecutor has not yet brought charges in the two cases, German legislation allows for emergency sales if assets seized in ongoing investigations face an immediate threat of loss of value, according to the report. “Since all cryptocurrencies are exposed to the risk of high price fluctuations or even total loss, the Bayern Central Office of Cybercrime ordered an emergency sale,” the state prosecutors explained in the report. Following the sale, the office has yet to determine how to handle the proceeds, since it remains unclear whether the prosecutor will move forward with the investigations. At the end of last year, the Central Office of Cybercrime in Germany’s Hesse state also made a notable sale of 126 bitcoins confiscated over several years through investigations on the darknet. At the time, bitcoin’s price was around its all-time-high at $20,000, which resulted in proceeds of nearly $2.3 million, according to an earlier report from Der Tagesspiegel.

1," Bitcoin (BTC) risks falling to the key support level of $6,900, having failed to capitalize on signs of weakening bearish momentum yesterday. The cryptocurrency’s technical charts saw a doji candle on Sunday, signaling short-term bearish exhaustion. However, a corrective rally remained elusive as bitcoin ran into offers above $7,400 and closed (as per UTC) at $7,143 – the lowest daily close since April 12, according to Bitfinex. Prices continued to drop today, with bitcoin hitting a 7-week low of $7,040 this morning. At time of writing, the price was at $7,130. The losses signal a continuation of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 and indicate scope for a drop to $6,900 – a level that the bulls need to defend at all cost. If they can’t, prices may go as low as $5,000.  BTC created a bearish outside-day candle on Monday. These occur when a high is above the previous day’s high and the low is below the previous day’s low. In simple terms, it means trading on Monday started with optimism and ended with pessimism. The bearish outside-day usually indicates a bullish-to-bearish trend change. However, when viewed against the backdrop of Sunday’s doji candle, the bearish outside-day signals revival/continuation of the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990. The above chart also shows the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MA) are trending south in favor of the bears. The relative strength index (RSI) has dropped to 30.00, indicating oversold conditions. According to historical data, bitcoin climbs every time the RSI on the daily chart drops to or below 30.00. However, the historical pattern may not come into play this time, as BTC’s long-term technical studies have turned in favor of the bears. For instance, the weekly RSI is below 50.00 (in the bearish territory). Further, BTC recently closed below the 50-week MA for the first time since 2015, adding credence to the argument the long-run bull market is over. Meanwhile, the 5-month and 10-month MAs are beginning to slope downwards in favor of the bears. As a result, it’s likely that BTC will drop to $6,900 (triangle support) soon – although it may not happen in the next 24 hours as the short-duration chart shows a temporary bullish setup.  BTC has created lower lows in the last 48 hours, but the RSI has not followed suit – a bullish divergence that indicates scope for a minor corrective rally. Bitcoin image via Shutterstock"
0," Will Bitcoin price (BTC) rebound this year? Bitcoin price traded in the red over the last three consecutive weeks amid downgrades from big names and price manipulation scandals. After losing billions of dollars over the past three weeks, the largest coin is now receiving strong support around the $7,000 level. However, traders are in doldrums as its becoming more difficult to predict where the cryptocurrency market will move from here.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Spencer Bogart, a partner at major VC firm Blockchain Capital and also one of the first Wall Street analysts to cover Bitcoin, suggests that traders should buy Bitcoin during dips. Although he presented a pessimistic outlook for the short-term, the analyst sees a sharp rebound in the third and fourth quarter of this year. Bogart expects Bitcoin price to extend its losses next month before bouncing back to $10K by the end of this year. Could Bitcoin trade lower? He says: “certainly”, but then added, “But I would bet Bitcoin ends at least above $10,000 in the year.” Bogart’s claim for the potential upside is based on higher institutional adaptation. He said, “The long-term thesis is very much intact… The institutionalization of Bitcoin is absolutely occurring…Every major bank is trying to do something in the space. Either they’re going to be offering Bitcoin to their clients, they’re working on a custody platform, or they’re opening up a trading desk.” While the Wall Street expert was bullish on Bitcoin’s price outlook, he recommended selling some altcoins that are overvalued. He believes shorting Cardano, IOTA, TRON, and NEO is a good strategy, but he was “neutral” on Ripple, Ethereum, EOS and Bitcoin Cash.  Source Image: twitter.com Spencer Bogart has highlighted a more conservative outlook then Brian Kelly and John McAfee – who both have been expecting Bitcoin price to make substantial gains, both in the short and long-term. Trader and market participants reacted positively to Bogarts claims. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© BiancoBlue"
0," Grant West, the 26-year-old Just Eat hacker, was sentenced to 10 years in prison after the trial -resulting from a massive scam he perpetrated in 2015 – has ended. According to reports by the BBC, the scamming process lasted just five months during which Mr. West was responsible for sending bogus emails to over 165,000 people pretending to be part of the Just Eat fast food chain. In the emails, he offered a £10GBP coupon to clients in exchange for filling out a survey about customer satisfaction with the services provided. However, the survey also required there to be personal data filled out that many did in the belief they were doing it confidentially.  (courtesy BBC) West subsequently compiled this data and sold it on the Deep Web to other scammers through the now-defunct Dark Market known as Alpha Bay. He used the pseudonym “Courvoisier” for this purpose.  (courtesy: BBC) According to official information, he was able to raise £2 million worth in crypto (approximately $2.6M USD) from the sale of the “Fullz.” After tracking him down, the police were able to capture him on a train from Ryll to London. Subsequent investigations concluded that there was no attack on Just Eat’s internal servers or systems; however, the losses caused totaled figures in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. When police Raided Mr. West’s House, they found an sd card with the details of at least 63,000 credit cards, £2 million worth in crypto, 500gr of cannabis, seven million email addresses with passwords, and the corporate information of more than 500 companies. >>Addicted to Crypto Trading? There’s a Treatment Centre For That! According to the judge, the operation was a “one man cybercrime wave.” His words about West’s actions were harsh: “When such inadequate security is confronted with a criminal of your skills and ambition it is totally unfit for purpose and worthless… This case should be a wake-up call to customers, companies and the computer industry to the very real threat of cybercrime.” Mr. West, who pleaded guilty to the charges, received a 10-year sentence, while his girlfriend, Rachael Brookes, 26, was accused of trying to sell stolen information taken by her boyfriend, received a community order after pleading guilty to unauthorized access of computer material.

0," James Howells is the name of the man who lost a hard drive with the key to more than USD 50 million in Bitcoin. Having gotten into mining in 2009, early enough to make a fortune, he accidentally threw away the hard drive holding thousands of Bitcoins. “I mined more than 7,500 coins over one week’s time in 2009; there were just six of us doing it at the time, and it was like the early days of a gold rush,” the IT worker turned crypto investor told New York Post. “Four years later, I had two hard drives in a desk drawer. One was empty and the other contained my Bitcoin private keys. I meant to throw away the empty drive — and I accidentally threw away the one with the Bitcoin information.” He’s not the only one with such bad luck: Atlanta-based software developer Syl Turner mined two Bitcoins in 2010 and forgot about it. When the price started rising from November on, he found that old computer in the attic, but also found that he had overwritten his private key.  Meanwhile, Howells is still struggling to get his coins back. He’s even offered the town of Newport 10% of the Bitcoins’ value if they’ll let him excavate the landfill. So far, they’ve denied his requests. Still, he considers his coins to be perfectly safe there: “Nobody else can get in there and take my hard drive,” he said. “It’s like having [millions] in the bank, but you cannot get into the bank account.”"
0," Total market capitalization this year: The crypto market remained under selling pressure during the past few days, resulting in downsides in bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, ripple and other major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin price settled below the USD 7,600 and USD 7,500 support levels, opening the doors for more losses. Looking at the current market sentiment, there are many bearish signs, which could result in fresh lows this week. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently down around 1% to USD 7,220, with an immediate support at USD 7,150. A break below the stated USD 7,150 support will most likely push the price further lower towards the all-important USD 7,000 level.
If BTC/USD sellers remain in control during the following sessions, there is a risk of a downside break below USD 7,000. On the upside, weekly resistances are at USD 7,500 and USD 7,600. Above this last, the significant hurdle is at USD 8,000. Ethereum
Ethereum tumbled by more than 8% and declined below the last low near USD 550. ETH/USD is currently under heavy selling pressure and it could even test the USD 500 support. Below USD 500, there is an open space up to USD 440.
On the flip side, if the price corrects higher, the previous supports at USD 580 and USD 600 are likely to act as resistance. A daily close above USD 600 is must for a bounce back in ETH in the near term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price settled below a crucial support at USD 1,000, clearing the path for more declines. BCH/USD is currently down 6.5% to USD 925, with an immediate support at USD 900. Weekly resistances are at USD 980 and USD 1,000.
Ripple closed below USD 0.60, which is a strong bearish signal. XRP/USD may now decline further and it could test the next weekly support at USD 0.55, which is an important level. Other Altcoins Market Today
Almost all low cap altcoins declined today, including Nano, Tron, ICON, WAN, Kin, Zcash, KNC, Steem and others. Two altcoins, Civic and All Sports performed well and traded higher by more than 20%.  Overall, the current price action and technical structure is signaling a bearish bias. To initiate a decent recovery, bitcoin must break the USD 7,600 resistance and close above USD 8,000."
0," While the odds are still stacked in favor of bitcoin’s bears, a level of indecision looks to be creeping in, according to the technical charts. The cryptocurrency fell to a 6.5-week low of $7,142 on Bitfinex earlier today, having breached the 50-week moving average (MA) support for the first time since 2015. Amid the continued drop in prices, though, the charts show a doji candle formed yesterday, indicating that the bears may be running out of steam and a short-term rally could be on the cards. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,210 – down 16.58 percent from the last Monday’s high of $8,644.  The pennant breakdown, a bearish continuation pattern, on the 4-hour chart indicates the sell-off from the last Monday’s high of $8,644 has resumed and opened the doors to $6,800 (target as per the measured height method: pennant range subtracted from breakout price). The 50-candle, 100-candle, and 200-candle moving averages (MAs) are aligned in favor of a further drop in prices.  On the daily chart, the 5-day and 10-day MAs are trending south, indicating a short-term bearish setup. A series of lower highs and lower lows also indicates the bears are in control. The relative strength index (RSI) is holding slightly above 30.00, signaling just enough room for another $200 drop in BTC prices.  The first weekly close below the 50-week MA in nearly three years only validates the argument that the long-term bull market has ended. The relative strength index (RSI) has also rolled over in favor of the bears, while the 5-week MA is set to cross the 10-week MA from above, signaling a bearish crossover. Clearly, BTC is on the defensive, still, there is merit in being cautious as the cryptocurrency created a small doji candle on Sunday (as seen in the daily chart) at the key 76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $7,209, indicating bear indecision in the marketplace. Thus, a minor corrective rally could be in the offing if bitcoin posts gain today (bullish doji reversal). Chart image via Shutterstock"
0," John McAfee – who is known for making big price bets, has presented a bullish thesis for the next cryptocurrency market rally. He predicts a few coins – including Bitcoin (BTC) and EOS (EOS) will achieve robust price growths next month,  before collapsing in July. Bitcoin price currently trades around the $7,500 level but John McAfee expects BTC price to trade at around $15,000 next month.  He also predicts that EOS price will hit $32 next month.  Source Image: twitter.com Bears, however, don’t accept his price bet, as he’s backed claim on Trump’s meeting with the North Korean president. He tweeted: “My algorithm is still predicting the meeting between two leaders, which could take place in Japan next month.”    Source Image: twitter.com Donald Trump, on the other hand, publically denied meeting with the North Korean President after his offensive remarks. He also told Kim in the letter, “You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used.” Bears say, that Donald Trump has called off the meeting, but if he meets with Kim Jong-un would John McAfee’s prediction be correct? and what would be the fundamental impact on the cryptocurrency market be? Its right that political stability always has a positive impact on investment markets, so the meeting between the head of the two countries could have the potential to create a 100% rally in price. On the other hand, the stock markets, for instance, plunged only 1% after Donald Trump refused to meet with North Korean President.  Source Image: twitter.com John McAfee, however, has previously revealed that he charges hundreds of thousands of dollars for each promotional tweet about cryptocurrency markets. So is his prediction just another paid publicity? Market reaction was strong against John McAfee’s price bet; the majority of Twitter users mocked his price prediction. What are your thoughts?

0," Bitcoin extended declines yesterday, but buyers were able to hold losses below USD 7,250. BTC/USD formed a short-term bottom pattern with a strong bullish candle and recovered above USD 7,400. Similarly, all major altcoins including ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin and Neo corrected above key resistance levels. The current price action suggests that the market was well bid near weekly lows and prices could correct further higher during the following sessions. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently down 1.3% to USD 7,410 (GMT 8:00 AM) and is holding the USD 7,250 support. The last 4-hour chart was positive, suggesting a slight recovery above USD 7,600. However, the USD 7,600 - USD 7,700 zone is a crucial barrier for buyers. A successful close above the mentioned barrier could open the doors for a test of USD 8,000.
On the downside, price must hold the USD 7,250 support. If buyers fail to defend the stated USD 7,250, there may perhaps be a strong slide towards USD 6,900 in the near term. Ethereum
Ethereum price bounced back sharply and moved above the USD 600 level. However, ETH/USD struggled near the USD 610 - USD 615 region, and is currently down to USD 595. 
It seems like the price may move back above USD 600 during the coming sessions as long as it is above USD 575. Should there be a downside break below USD 575, the price may possibly decline further towards USD 550. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is showing a positive signs above USD 980. BCH/USD is currently up 2.2% to USD 1,010 and is moving with a bullish angle. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 1,040, followed by USD 1,080. Supports on the downside are at USD 980 and USD 960. Ripple managed to crawl back above USD 0.60, which is a positive sign. However, buyers need to push the price above the USD 0.62 resistance to accelerate upsides.  Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins gained traction today. Coins like Bitcoin Private, CyberMiles, Kin, EOS and Mixin surged higher by more than 10% to move in the green zone. Overall, if the recent bounce in bitcoin is real and the price settles above USD 7,500, there are real chances of BTC/USD gaining bullish momentum toward USD 8,000. On the flip side, a break below USD 7,250 will most likely accelerate declines."
0," The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has started a criminal probe into potential Bitcoin trading manipulation, but major players remain unfazed. Both Mike Novogratz, a billionaire investor, and Cameron Winklevoss, president and co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini, agree that they’re not surprised by such allegations and that they welcome the investigation. Novogratz, who is setting up cryptocurrency merchant bank Galaxy Digital LP, told Bloomberg, “Weeding out the bad actors is a good thing, not a bad thing for the health of the market. Plenty of exchanges have these inflated volume numbers to create some sense of excitement around coins.” Winklevoss said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg that, “We welcome any inquiry that serves to foster rules-based marketplaces and deter bad actors.” Tom Lee, of Fundstrat Global Advisors, agrees: “This is really welcome news ultimately because this means there is adult supervision coming/here.” Spencer Bogart of cryptocurrency hedge fund Blockchain Capital said he wouldn’t be surprised to find price manipulations rampant: “I don’t have any first-hand evidence of manipulation of Bitcoin prices but given that even the most highly regulated and most liquid markets in the world (e.g. Libor, FX markets, commodities) have consistently proven to be manipulated, it wouldn’t be a huge surprise.” On Thursday, Bloomberg published a report that the DOJ opened a criminal probe into potential manipulation of the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, citing four people familiar with the matter."
0," Bitcoin risks closing below the 50-week moving average (MA) – an important long-term support not breached for over two-and-a-half years. With the bears already on the offensive following the recent sell-off, prices are likely to suffer if bitcoin closes on Sunday below the key support, currently seen at $7,611. More worryingly for the bulls, since the cryptocurrency has not traded below the 50-week MA since October 2015, acceptance below that level would only add credence to the argument that the long-term bull run has ended. As of writing, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,449 on Bitfinex, having dropped below the 50-week MA on May 23.  As seen on the chart above, the long-term moving average had acted as a strong support in the first quarter. BTC found strong bids in mid April following the repeated failure (marked by a circle) on the part of the bears to penetrate the 50-week MA. Subsequently, the rally from the 50-week MA to $9,990 (May 5 high) reinforced the moving average as a strong long-term support. Hence, a downside break would raise the odds of a slide to fresh 2017 lows below $6,000. Looking ahead, price chart analysis suggests that bitcoin is likely to end the week below the key $7,611 level. To start with, the weekly relative strength index (RSI) is below 50.00 (in the bearish territory) and trending south in favor of the bears. The RSI has also found acceptance below the key support zone of 53.55–55.00, which only strengthens the bear case. Meanwhile, the daily chart below also shows scope for a drop below $7,000.  The bears currently have the upper hand, as indicated by the lower highs and lower lows pattern, downside break of the channel, downward sloping (bearish) 5-day and 10-day MAs. The RSI is holding below 50.00 (in the bearish territory), but well above 30.00 (oversold region), indicating room for sell-off to $6,870 (triangle support).  Despite the bullish price RSI divergence on the hourly chart, BTC failed to cross the falling trendline hurdle, underscoring the strong bearish sentiment in the market.

1," Tom Lee – who has been making big bets on the upside potential of Bitcoin price, is standing by his prediction that BTC will soar to $25K by the end of the year. Bitcoin price today, however, retreated below $8K yesterday and is trading around $7,300 today.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Technical analysts are forecasting the bearish trend will extend its momentum while trend makers and business icons are also presenting a bleak outlook for the entire cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrencies are the most volatile asset in the world, at least in this era. This is because everything is a possibility in this market; crypto coins have created such major rallies in the past, including last year’s rally – when Bitcoin price rose from $1,000 to $20,000. At the moment, however, the market is much more mature and traders are closely inspecting all the pros and cons of digital currencies. Regulator interference and bans from several countries have also wiped off the illegal trading volume – which accounted for almost half of the trading volume during last years bull-run. Tom Lee has totally based his price bet on speculation that institutional investors will push prices higher later in the year. He said, “I think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest, and they haven’t really come into crypto yet because there is still some regulatory uncertainty. But that sort of ultimate allocation into crypto as an asset class is going to be a powerful reason why bitcoin rallies.”  Source Image: twitter.com Market reaction to Tom Lee’s claims was mixed. Some are going against his bet while others are optimistic about the future upside potential. Tom Lee, however, didn’t express his thoughts regarding Bitcoin’s potential to work as viable currency. He also didn’t speak about the “fair value” concept. Featured Image: Twitter "
1," Bitcoin Price Manipulation – The U.S Department of Justice just launched an investigation into whether traders are manipulating the price of Bitcoin and other digital tokens, Bloomberg reported this morning. The investigation primarily focuses on illegal practices that can influence the price of these coins, such as “spoofing” – flooding the market with fake orders to trick other traders into buying or selling. Another illicit tactic the DOJ is looking into is called ‘wash trading,’ which traders trade with themselves to create the illusion of volume. This tactic is prevalent in equity and futures markets. John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied market manipulation, told a reporter at Bloomberg, “There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading. It would be easy to spoof this market.” The DOJ’s investigation is still in its early stages and is following the country’s latest crackdown on various blockchain projects, in both Canada and the U.S. Cryptocurrency trading is fragmented in dozens of cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms across the globe, many of which are located in Asia and aren’t registered with the SEC or CFTC. The CFTC doesn’t regulate the trading of cryptocurrency, but if it finds fraud in the ‘spot market,’ it holds the authority to impose sanctions. Red Flags The Winklevoss Twins, who own the Gemini Exchange, conducted a surveillance of the digital coins being traded on their platform last month. The twins then urged other trading platforms to band together to potentially form a group that would ‘self-regulate’ the industry. It seems that the duo sensed the government oversight drawing near. Many market participants have alleged that cryptocurrency manipulation is rampant, and you can clearly see that by the hundreds of ‘pump’ tactics initiated a day. The question then that remains is – how do we stop it?  Not the regulators, or the government, but us, the cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors. Can it be stopped without these regulators intervening? Leave your thoughts in the comment box below! Featured Image: Canva"
1," Bitcoin remained under heavy selling pressure and extended its slide below USD 8,000. It broke a key support area near USD 7,550 - USD 7,600, opening the doors for sellers to take control. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Neo and Cardano also followed BTC and declined sharply during the past three sessions.  However, according to experts the current drop won’t bother bitcoin bulls. In an email to CNBC, Fundstrat's Tom Lee, stated that the recent slide is mainly due to ""typical crypto volatility"". He still thinks that bitcoin could hit USD 25,000 despite the recent drop. Lee believes, who recently admitted he was wrong to predict the Consensus conference rally, that once institutional investors jump into the market, there could be solid gains in bitcoin. However, as reported yesterday, there may possibly be a correction going into the July-September period, followed by an accumulation phase. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is down roughly 3.8% to USD 7,530 (GMT 8:00 AM) with an immediate support at USD 7,500. If BTC/USD accelerate declines below the stated USD 7,500 support, the next major support is near the USD 7,200 level. Below this last, the price may perhaps test the USD 7,000 support.
On the upside, the price is facing a major resistance near USD 7,850. A successful close above USD 8,000 is must for bitcoin to bounce back.  Ethereum
Ethereum price was under a lot of pressure and it almost tested the USD 550 level. ETH/USD tumbled and settled below a key support at USD 600, which can be seen as a strong bearish sign.
At the outset, the price is currently correcting towards USD 600. However, the stated level will most likely act as a resistance and prevent gains above USD 605 - USD 610. On the downside, supports are at USD 650 and USD 660. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash traded lower sharply and even broke a crucial support near USD 1,000. BCH/USD is down 6% and is currently trading near USD 980. If sellers remain in control, the price could slide further towards the USD 950 support.
Ripple continued its decline and broke yet another important support at USD 0.60. It seems like XRP/USD is now preparing for a test of the USD 0.50 support. Resistances on the upside are at USD 0.62 and USD  0.65. Other Altcoins Market Today
Most altcoins declined during the past three sessions, including Bitcoin Diamond, Stratis, Dash, BNB, GNT, Monero, DigiByte and Tron. The only altcoin that grabbed the market attention was Skycoin. SKY price pumped roughly 40% to trade above USD 32 after Binance announced that the exchange will list SKY."
1," German stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse, one of the world's largest trading centres for securities, is “deep at work” on evaluating whether to offer Bitcoin futures and other cryptocurrency-related services, Bloomberg reported, citing Jeffrey Tessler, the company’s head of clients, products and core markets. Tessler said that the firm is holding serious discussions about listing bitcoin products, though it still has reservations about the young industry. He added, “Before we move forward with anything like Bitcoin we want to make sure we understand the underlying transaction which isn’t the easiest thing to do,” adding that they’re “deep at work,” acknowledging that the group is “not at the same stage” as CME, its Chicago-based rival and currently the world leader in regulated Bitcoin futures trading. But while CME and CBOE, fellow Chicago exchange, have been known to jump up to USD 670 million in combined Bitcoin futures volume during a single trading session, no major European exchange has listed futures for Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.  Meanwhile, regulated UK trading platform Crypto Facilities has launched futures products for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple, but a company the size of Deutsche Boerse is still to offer such services. On the other side of the pond, the operators of both the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq are holding discussions about listing cryptocurrency products, while NYSE parent company ICE is rumored to be launching an actual cryptocurrency exchange."
1," Bitcoin (BTC) is trading on the defensive today, having dropped 16 percent over the last three days. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,270 on Bitfinex, down 6.5 percent in the last 24 hours, and could extend the slide further to $7,000 in the next 24 hours. The cryptocurrency closed (as per UTC) at $7,494 yesterday – its lowest daily close since April 12 – and looked oversold as per the relative strength index (RSI) in the hourly and 4-hour chart. A resulting corrective rally ran info offers above $7,700 earlier today and prices fell to a 6-week low of $7,352 at 08:30 UTC. The failure on the part of the bulls to produce a notable corrective rally despite oversold conditions indicates that bearish sentiment is currently strong.  The downside break of the bear flag, a bearish continuation pattern, indicates the minor corrective rally from the low of $7,402 has ended and BTC could drop to $7,000 (target as per the measured height method). The 50-hour, 100-hour and 200-hour moving averages (MAs) are biased to the bears. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) has dropped close to the oversold region (30.00), but is holding well above the lows seen yesterday, indicating there is enough room for a drop to $7,000.  BTC closed (as per UTC) yesterday below $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement) in a convincing manner, signaling a bullish-to-bearish trend change. Note that a break below the 61.8 percent Fib is widely considered a final confirmation of a bearish trend reversal. The chart also shows a bearish downside break of the falling channel, while the 5-day and 10-day MAs are trending south, also in favor of the bears. The relative strength index is holding below 50.00 – well above 30.00 (oversold zone), signaling scope for further losses. Chart image via Shutterstock"
0," Bitcoin Price plummeted below the $8000 level today for the first time in last the last thirty-five days. The constant bashing from business icons and trend makers are the most prominent drivers for the steep selloff. Bitcoin price lost 20% of its value since it hit the $9,900 mark on May 12. The selloff is quite surprising for bulls as they were expecting BTC price to generate solid gains considering Goldman Sachs, NASDAQ, and Intercontinental Exchange are all now backing the coin.    BKCM founder Brian Kelly was also stunned by the market behavior. He believes the entrance of Wall Street into the cryptocurrency market isn’t a small event. Trend makers and remarks from influencers always have a substantial impact on investing markets. Stock market experts, business icons, and Fed’s officials have been expressing negative thoughts for the cryptocurrency market. Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, PayPal CFO and Ali Baba founder all have rejected the use of cryptocurrencies as the viable currency. Some of them have criticized crypto coins on higher volatility while others believe it doesn’t have any store of value. This is because they expect Bitcoin and other digital currencies might have a bad ending. A bearish outlook for Bitcoin price from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard’s added to the selling pressure. Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari has also banged the cryptocurrency market, saying it has become a “farce” due to unregulated chaos and escalating fraud.  Bulls have failed to defend Bitcoin price and the rest of cryptocurrency market. The entire market has been declining at a steady rate over the last two weeks, resulting in the loss of over 100 billion from total market capitalization since May 12. Although Bitcoin bull Tom Lee blames a lack of regularity clarity for the recent losses, retail investors are coming up with reckless claims. Featured Image: twitter"
0," Bitcoin failed to gain traction above the USD 8,200 support area. BTC/USD declined heavily and broke many support levels, including USD 8,000 and USD 7,800. Looking at the current price action, bitcoin is in a bearish zone and it could decline further. According a popular crypto analyst, Willy Woo, the USD 8,000 support was bound to give up. He thinks that the next support sits near USD 7,000, which may perhaps break if sellers remain in control. Finally, there may possibly be a correction going into the July-September period, followed by an accumulation phase. Technically, the recent break below USD 8,000 was significant. The price could test USD 7,000 as suggested in a tweet by Woo, but it has to stay above the last major low (USD 6,430) to avoid a significant collapse back to USD 5,000. Bitcoin
Today, bitcoin price is down 5.6% to USD 7,840 (GMT 9:00 AM). An immediate support is at USD 7,550, which is a crucial pivot zone. Therefore, if BTC/USD continues to move down, it might face a strong buying interest near USD 7,550. Below this last, the price will most likely head towards USD 7,000.
On the upside, the previous support at USD 8,000 is an important hurdle for buyers. A daily close above USD 8,000, followed by a push above USD 8,200 is required to decrease the current bearish pressure.  Ethereum
Ethereum price tumbled and declined below the USD 650 support. It seems like ETH/USD is heading towards the USD 600 handle, which is a key support. 
It is currently down 11.10% to USD 615. On the upside, resistances are seen near USD 640, USD 645 and USD 650. On the flip side, a break below USD 600 might clear the path for a test of USD 560. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price is down 12% and is trading near the USD 1,050 level. BCH/USD is likely to accelerate declines towards the next major support at USD 1,000. Resistances are at USD 1,080 and USD 1,100.
Ripple extended declines and is currently down 9.5% to USD 0.607. XRP/USD seems to be approaching the USD 0.60 support, below which, the price could accelerate declines to USD 0.50. Other Altcoins Market Today
Almost all altcoins are in the red zone today except ZenCash. ZEN was listed on Binance today, which sparked an upside move and the price moved above the USD 35.00 level. Overall, the current market sentiment is extremely bearish, and a daily close below USD 8,000 in bitcoin will most likely affirm a negative trend."
0," Have you had trouble understanding what Bitcoin really is? Did you find that you understand the basics, but hashes and blocks and mining is too much for you? Worry not, artificial intelligence (AI) is there to save the day! The video was made by Botnik Studios, an entertainment group devoted to displaying the work of the larger community*, and as they say, this is “a very basic stage training on Bitcoin, written using predictive keyboards trained on dozens of Bitcoin explainers.” What their AI came up with probably exceeded everyone’s wildest dreams - but watch for yourself to fully appreciate this work of art. The explanation sounds surreal because it is - cryptocurrency is helping us transcend the traditional sense of humor and elevate our minds to a new plane of consciousness. Or something like that. It does not take an AI to write nonsensical sentences, although they do it better. The comment section of the video features many people who have seen the light: some ask “why does this make sense?” Others write, “Thanks for this video, I was very confused before and now I know everything.﻿” There are those who are already ordering framed prints of especially great sentences, such as “Hashing that code to get some of that Bitcoin” or getting themselves counterfeit coffee.

0," Following bitcoin’s recent losses, a key long-term trend indicator is looking increasingly bearish. Notably, the five-month moving average (MA) has rolled over in favor of the bears and looks set to cut the 10-month MA from above – a bearish crossover that hasn’t been seen since June 2014. If that occurs it could be a worrying signal for the long-term price outlook. Back then, following an identical crossover in June 2014, the cryptocurrency subsequently dropped by 70 percent (from $580 to $166) in the seven months leading up to January 2015. This time around, the bearish crossover will likely occur at the turn of the month, if bitcoin extends the current decline towards the $7,000 mark, and would open the doors for a deeper sell-off towards the $5,000 mark.  Currently, the five-month MA is seen at $8,916 and the 10-month MA is located at $8,379, according to Bitfinex data. Meanwhile, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,820 – down almost 5 percent in the last 24 hours.  The observed lower-highs and lower-lows pattern (marked by circles) and the downward sloping 5-day and 10-day MAs indicate a bearish setup. The chart also shows a bearish crossover between the 10-day and 50-day MAs. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) is below 50.00 (in the bearish territory), but holding well above 30.00 (oversold territory), indicating enough room for a sell-off towards $7,000.  Acceptance below the 50-week MA, currently seen at $7,620, would only bolster the already bearish daily chart technicals and increase the odds of the bearish five-month/10-month MA crossover. The 50-week MA worked as a strong support in April, so a break below that level could yield a sharp sell-off. Down arrow image via Shutterstock"
0," Bitcoin’s price has slipped below $8,000 to hit a 35-day low. Just an hour after the May 23 trading session began, data from CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index shows the price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency started to fall, dropping to its lowest point since April 18. After steadily climbing up to nearly $10,000 on May 6, bitcoin’s price has been on a gradual decline since then towards a current low at $7,876, reflecting a 20 percent drop over the past two weeks.  The price has bounced back slightly to $7,910 as of press time. That said, the current price still shows a 30 percent premium over bitcoin’s lowest point this year at $5,947 seen on Feb. 5. Meanwhile, bitcoin’s price drop also coincides with a wider market sell-off. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is also at its one-month low with $352 billion changing hands. In fact, nearly all of the top 100 assets by market cap are showing 10 to 20 percent declines at press time. According to CoinMarketCap, among the world’s largest five cryptocurrencies, both XRP and bitcoin cash are trading at a one-month low at $0.63 and $1,120 respectively. Image via CoinDesk archive"
0," Joe Davis; Vanguard economist believes that Bitcoin price (BTC) will crash to zero, and it will never emerge as reliable currency. Bitcoin price remains range-bound after falling 15% from three months high of $9,900 level. The bearish trend has been receiving support from influential icons. The debate over the use of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange is also contributing to the sell-off. Bitcoin price trades around the $8,300 level today. Altcoins are in the red after a short rally at the beginning of the week.  The total cryptocurrency market hovers in the range of $380 billion, down from $465 billion it hit a few days ago.  Joe Davis, the chief economist for $5.1 trillion asset management firm Vanguard, thinks cryptocurrencies aren’t the alternative of fiat currency. His stance is similar to PayPal CFO and Warren Buffet – who already has rejected the possibility of using Bitcoin as the medium of exchange. The economist of the $5.1 trillion asset management firm warned investors that Bitcoin price is likely to crash to zero. He suggested investors keep their focus towards “tried and true asset classes”. He believes that allocating even a small portion of the investment portfolio to cryptocurrencies could turn out to be a big mistake. He said, “The investment case for cryptocurrencies is weak. Unlike stocks and bonds, currencies generate no cash flows such as interest payments or dividends that can explain their prices. National currencies derive their prices from the underlying economic activity of the countries that issue them. “ The economist further argued that cryptocurrencies could be used as a medium of exchange, but they don’t have a store of value. Although the majority of market participants believe the higher level of volatility in cryptocurrency prices makes it harder for the global community to use it as a medium of exchange, they think the market needs some time and more regulation clarity for complete stabilization.  Twitter users reacted strongly against Joe Davis arguments. Cryptocurrency followers are comparing Bitcoin and other virtual currencies with the early age of internet and the Dow Jones.

0," Today is May 22, in the cryptoverse known as Bitcoin Pizza Day. Eight years ago, on this day in 2010, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz paid another Bitcoin talk forum user for two Papa John’s pizzas for the low, low price of 10,000 BTC (worth about USD 25 at the time.) Now, that amount would be worth around USD 80 million. Nobody is going to let him forget that. There is a Twitter account @bitcoin_pizza, that only tweets how much those pizzas are worth every day, and how it compares to the previous day. The #Bitcoin pizza is worth $83,131,600 today. (-2% from yesterday) Today is Bitcoin pizza day! Is Hanyecz sorry that he didn’t HODL? He said last year in an interview with the New York Times, “It wasn’t like Bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool. No one knew it was going to get so big.” And today, the whole crypto world celebrates. Searching “Bitcoin Pizza Day” on Facebook returns a long list of events all over the globe, marking this momentous occasion. Also, some people tweet their own Bitcoin pizzas, like Huobi, a cryptocurrency exchange, did. Of course, we’d wager that these are worth significantly less than USD 80 million, but they sport the Bitcoin logo, so it’s close enough.

0," Bitcoin buyers struggled to gain traction above the USD 8,500 resistance, resulting in a downward reaction. However, declines in BTC/USD were contained and it seems like the price is currently consolidating above the USD 8,200 support. There are a few negative signs emerging on charts, but none of them are convincing. This indicates that there could be more ranging moves before bitcoin buyers’ jump into action.  Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently down 2.3% to USD 8,315 (GMT 9:00 AM), with an immediate support at USD 8,250. However, the most important support sits near USD 8,200. Should buyers fail to keep the price above the USD 8,200 support, BTC/USD could tumble below USD 8,000. 
To the topside, an initial resistance is near USD 8,400. To gain upside momentum, the price has to move above USD 8,500, which is a key pivot zone.  Ethereum
Ethereum price failed to stay above the USD 710 and USD 700 support levels. ETH/USD is down roughly 2.5% and is currently trading near USD 694. A close above the USD 700 resistance is required for a decent bounce towards the next resistance at USD 720.
On the downside, the USD 680 is a short-term range support. A break below this may perhaps clear the path for ETH sellers to take control. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price once again declined below USD 1,200 and is currently down 5.5%. It seems like BCH/USD is trading in a broad range of USD 1,150 - USD 1,240. A proper daily close above USD 1,240 and 1,250 is needed for further gains towards USD 1,300.
Ripple is struggling to move above the USD 0.70 barrier. XRP/USD is currently down 3.7% to USD 0.672, with an immediate support at USD 0.665. On the upside, resistances are at USD 0.68 and USD 0.70. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, many altcoins corrected lower including ONT, bitcoin private, nano, lisk, DGB, golem, litecoin, tron and veChain. It seems like the current market sentiment is slightly bearish, suggesting chances of more downsides in the short term. However, if bitcoin price stays above USD 8,200 and buyers succeed in pushing the price above USD 8,500, the market could turn green once again."
0," Eight years ago today, the first reported exchange of bitcoin for a consumer product – a pair of Papa John’s pizzas – took place. At a total cost of 10,000 bitcoins, it was a milestone for the adoption of cryptocurrency and one that has since been commemorated though the celebration of May 22 as “Bitcoin Pizza Day.” Yet even the most cursory observation of Bitcoin Pizza Day isn’t complete without a calculation of precisely how much, in dollar terms, those two pizzas cost. With that, CoinDesk is today releasing a new widget that provides a real-time calculation that you can add to any website.  As of press time, that’s about $83.7 million for the two pies, or just shy of $42 million apiece. But why does this matter? To understand, one needs to wind back the clock to 2010. In mid-May of that year, a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz sought to exchange some of his hard-earned bitcoins for pizza – several days later, he was able to do so with the aid of a fellow user of the Bitcoin Talk online forum, then a central hub for discussion around cryptocurrency. A deal was struck: 10,000 BTC for two Papa John’s pizzas. That eye-watering amount was worth a mere $25 at the time, or a fraction of a penny apiece. Yet at the time, it wasn’t so much the number of bitcoins spent or the product involved – the event was a milestone simply because the transaction had taken place. Though limited to 16 slices of pizza, the era of bitcoin-powered commerce had begun – not to mention the silent wincing over spending millions of dollars for two pizzas. “It wasn’t like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,” Hanyecz said in a 2013 interview with The New York Times, adding: “No one knew it was going to get so big.” Still, the tradition lives on, with the purchase being used to track other notable bitcoin milestones. Indeed, it was Hanyecz himself who would later participate in what might one day be known as “Lightning Pizza Day” after he used the next-generation technology, now in development, to purchase a pie in February.

0," Bitcoin’s failed bull move on Sunday has left the doors open for the bears to make a comeback. The inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on May 20 signaled a short-term bullish reversal that could have seen bitcoin rise to $9,000 (target as per the measured height method). However, the bulls ran out of steam at a high of $8,644 yesterday and prices had fallen back to $8,240 at time of writing – a drop of 2.8 percent over the last 24 hours, according to Bitfinex. The decline did not come as a surprise, though, given the breakout lacked volume support, and a drop to $8,000 could now be on the cards.  As seen in the chart above, BTC fell back below the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline yesterday, weakening the bulls and has established a lower-high and lower-low pattern (bearish setup). While a failed breakout usually indicates a bigger-picture bearish reversal, in this case it means the corrective rally from the low of $7,925 has ended and the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990 has resumed. Thus, prices could drop below the immediate support of $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement) seen in the daily chart below.  A break below $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement) would bolster the bearish setup seen in the hourly chart and would allow a drop to $8,000. Note, though, that the 5-day and 10-day moving averages are beginning to curl upwards, so if the price moves above $8,408 (daily high), the bulls could make a comeback.

0," This past week, we saw a bearish reaction in bitcoin and altcoins. BTC/USD broke the USD 8,500 and USD 8,250 support levels and moved towards USD 8,000. However, downsides were limited and bitcoin price consolidated above USD 8,000 to stage a solid recovery. It bounced back and moved above the broken USD 8,250 support level. Other major cryptocurrencies followed bitcoin and gained bullish traction. Going forward, if bitcoin breaks the USD 8,700 resistance, prices may continue to move higher. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently up roughly 2.5% at USD 8,520 (GMT 9:10 AM) and is showing positive signs. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 8,550. However, weekly hurdles for buyers are at USD 8,700 and USD 9,000. Above this last, BTC/USD may well zoom towards the USD 10,000 resistance.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 8,250, which is also a pivot level. Should there be a break below USD 8,250, the price may accelerate declines towards the next weekly supports at USD 8,000 and USD 7,600. Ethereum
Ethereum formed a strong base near USD 650 and started an upward move. ETH/USD climbed higher and moved above the USD 680 and USD 700 resistance levels, opening the doors for more upsides.
The pair is currently up 1% to USD 718 and it seems like buyers are in control. Resistances on the upside are at USD 725 and USD 738. A push above the last barrier at USD 738 will most likely call for a test of USD 800 this week. Bitcoin Cash and RippleBitcoin cash price declined heavily this past week and almost tested the USD 1,100 level. However, buyers protected losses below USD 1,125 and the price recovered above USD 1,200. BCH/USD is up 3% today to USD 1,270, with weekly resistances at USD 1,300 and USD 1,360.
Ripple declined below the USD 0.70 support this past week, and it is currently still above the stated level. However, the current price action suggests that XRP/USD could break USD 0.70 and rise further towards the next weekly resistances at USD 0.72 and USD 0.75. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, TRON caught the market attention and TRX price climbed around 15% to break the USD 0.08 resistance. It seems like Tron’s mainnet launch on May 31st (GMT +8) is the main driver for the current bullish wave. If the current momentum stays intact, the price may well test the USD 0.10 level. A few other altcoins to watch out this week are XRP, Neo, RChain, DigiByte, WTC, WAN and Loom Network. Overall, the crypto market opened in the green zone this week, and further gains depend on whether bitcoin succeeds in clearing the USD 8,700 hurdle or not."
0," Bitcoin (BTC) has bounced back above $8,500, but the rally is not backed by decent trading volumes, the technical charts indicate. The cryptocurrency closed below key technical levels on Thursday, signaling a bearish breakdown, but the sell-off unexpectedly ran out of steam at $7,925 a day later. Subsequently, bitcoin gained more than $500 over the weekend, rising back above resistance at the 50-day moving average. At time of writing, BTC is changing hands at around $8,530, having clocked a six-day high of $8,644 earlier today. While last week’s bearish trend seems to have run out of steam (as seen in the charts below), the weekend’s low-volume rally risks trapping the bulls on the wrong side of the market. The inverse head-and-shoulders breakout indicates short-term bullish trend reversal – i.e. the pullback from the high of $9,990 has ended and the breakout has opened the doors to $9,000 (target as per the measured height method.  The daily chart shows yesterday’s candle closed (as per UTC) above Saturday’s doji candle high of $8,468, signaling a bullish reversal. Further, the 5-day and 10-day moving averages have shed bearish bias (are no longer sloping downwards). As a result, the probability that bitcoin will rally to $9,000 this week is high. However, the bullish case significantly weakens if we take into account the figures for trading volume. Volume is an important indicator, as it shows the level of interest in bitcoin. A rally backed by high volumes means greater reliance can be placed on the bullish move. Conversely, a low volume rally trends to end up being a bull trap. In BTC’s case, currently, trading volume on Bitfinex continues to decline and more importantly remained low alongside positive price action, as seen in the chart above. Further, trading volume across all exchanges fell below $5 billion over the weekend – the lowest level since April 11, according to CoinMarketCap. Thus, the sustainability of the rally seen over the weekend is under question. Running up steps image via Shutterstock"
1," Bitcoin price (BTC) is crashing instead of rallying: Bitcoin price has failed to generate gains for investors since Warren Buffett, and Bill Gates rejected the cryptocurrency markets two weeks ago. Bitcoin price lost almost $1,800 in the last two weeks.  Several other industry experts are also refuting bitcoin’s potential to work as an alternate currency. They believe the higher level of volatility makes it difficult for the general public to use it as the medium of exchange.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Bitcoin price crashed to the $8,000 level today. The New York consensus summit also failed to fuel any rally for the largest coin. PayPal CFO John Rainey has rejected bitcoin’s potential to work as the medium of exchange, particularly for merchants that have low margins on their trades.  Source Image: twitter.com Rainey claims that merchants usually have a 10%-15% margin on their products. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has the potential to create price movements of 10%-15% in few hours alone – this makes it difficult for merchants to accept BTC as the tool of payment. Talking about the possibility of accepting Bitcoin in future, the CFO said, “You could have something that appeals to consumers, but if merchants don’t accept it, it’s of little value. Right now, we don’t see a lot of interest from our merchants. But if it’s something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we’ll certainly support that.”  Source Image: twitter.com The market has been apparently supporting Rainey’s stance. The price volatility in cryptocurrency markets is higher than any other asset or currency. Some market participants expect increasing regulators role could help in reducing the price volatility in the long-run.  Source Image: twitter.com Others reacted strongly to PayPal’s CFO’s comments. They believe the threat of cryptocurrencies on banks and payment service companies has been forcing them to reject digital currencies as the medium of exchange.

1," The Bitcoin (BTC) bubble theory has resurfaced again, as the founder of world’s largest e-commerce platform, Alibaba, just announced his views of the world’s first digital token. Jack Ma Yun, Alibaba Group’s founder and executive chairman, spoke in a forum on Wednesday and spoke highly of blockchain technology, but expressed his doubts about Bitcoin (BTC). “There is no bubble for blockchain, but there’s a bitcoin bubble,” Ma said in a panel at the second World Intelligence Congress forum. Ma said he has been researching blockchain for years and highly believes in its potential to solve security, and data privacy. The founder thinks that blockchain can be used by everyone including individuals, corporations, and even governments. Ma expressed security a top priority for his company, as Alibaba conducts ‘trillions of transactions’ a quarter. Ma said: “Social networks may not need blockchain, but we are doing internet finance in which we process trillions of trading volume. We have to turn to blockchain, otherwise, it would be fatal.”  The company reported $39.9 billion in yearly revenue in its latest fiscal Q4 earnings release. Alibaba currently has 43 published blockchain patent applications, which is followed by Bank of America which has 33. Standing Ground Ma said he first saw blockchain as a privacy and security solution, but never thought to turn it into something like Bitcoin (BTC) to make money. Clearly, the founder doesn’t understand the need to break away from central banks and hasn’t read the official whitepaper. Ma is one of Asia’s richest men, and his latest attitude towards Bitcoin (BTC) highly resonates with the Chinese government’s recent actions. However, in an interview back in December 2017, the founder told CNBC Shanghai:  “I don’t know about Bitcoin at all. I’m particularly puzzled. Even if it can really work, the rules of global trade and the financial system will be completely changed… We have a team that studies blockchain, but Bitcoin is not something that I want to pursue. We don’t care about Bitcoin.” It seems that Ma has always felt this way about the digital token, and the e-commerce giant won’t ever see Bitcoin (BTC) on its platform. Well, never say never – we’ll see. >> Tom Lee Bitcoin Prediction Fail Featured Image: News"
1," The past few sessions were most bearish as bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies struggled to recover. As a result, there was a bearish reaction and prices dropped sharply. BTC/USD declined below the USD 8,250 support and ETH/USD settled below USD 700. The overall market sentiment is currently negative, and technical indicators are pointing more downsides in the near term.  Bitcoin
Bitcoin price struggled to move above the USD 8,450 and USD 8,500 resistance levels. BTC/USD moved down and broke many supports such as USD 8,300 and USD 8,250. It declined close to USD 7,900 before recovering. 
The price is currently down 1.8% to USD 8,100 (GMT 8:45 AM), with an initial support at USD 8,000. Below this last, the price could retest the recent low of USD 7,910 and it might even break USD 7,900. On the upside, resistances are seen near USD 8,250 and USD 8,300. A break above USD 8,300 will most likely push the price towards the USD 8,500 hurdle. Ethereum
Ethereum declined sharply, settled below the USD 700 support, and traded towards USD 650. ETH/USD found buyers just above USD 650 and started an upside correction.
It is currently down 2.8% to USD 678 and it seems like any further recoveries are likely to face sellers on the topside around USD 690 and USD 700. On the downside, supports are at USD 660, USD 655 and USD 650. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash trimmed most of its gains and declined by more than 6% to USD 1,200. BCH/USD is currently at a risk of more losses below USD 1,200. The next support is at USD 1,150 - USD 1,160. On the upside, resistances are at USD 1,220, USD 1,240 and USD 1,250.
Ripple traded towards USD 0.65 and is currently down 3%. XRP/USD is finding it really hard to attract buyers and it remains at a risk of more losses below USD 0.65. Other Altcoins Market Today
Almost all small cap coins traded in the red zone today, except Syscoin. SYS coin price gained by more than 15% to move above the USD 0.40 resistance. Syscoin was added to the masternodes.online platform, which was the main driving force for the current upside.
To sum up, the crypto market is likely to end the week on a negative note unless bitcoin price jumps and trades above the USD 8,500 resistance."
1," Bitcoin’s (BTC) drop to one-month lows below $8,000 has strengthened the bear grip on the markets, the technical charts indicate. The cryptocurrency fell to $7,925 on Bitfinex earlier today – the lowest level since April 18 and has retraced 50 percent of the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 to May 5 high of $9,990. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,120, representing a 2 percent drop in the last 24 hours. The recovery from the low of $7,925 could be associated with the oversold conditions shown by the relative strength index (RSI) in the hourly chart. However, the gains will likely be short-lived as the odds are stacked against the bulls, according to technical charts.  BTC closed well below the 50-day moving average (MA) yesterday, signaling a continuation of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990. Further, BTC has also found acceptance below $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement), a level which acted as a strong support since May 12. The 5-day moving average (MA) and the 10-day MA continues to slope downwards in favor of the bears. The relative strength index (RSI) is also biased bearish (below 50.00 and falling). And last but not the least, BTC’s turn lower from $8,884 (May 14  high) and drop below $8,100 yesterday have established a lower highs and lows pattern (bearish setup). So, it is quite clear that the drop to one-month lows in the last 24 hours has the put bears in the driver’s seat. BTC looks set to test the immediate support lined up at $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement). A daily close (as per UTC) below that level would be the final confirmation of bearish trend reversal and will likely be followed by a sell-off $7,000. Only a daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA (currently seen at $8,555) would abort the bearish view and could yield sideways to positive action. Bitcoin image via Shutterstock"
0," Bitcoin shows no growth: Bitcoin Price (BTC) hasn’t moved higher despite the Consensus Summit: Bitcoin price trades in the range of $8,300 today after briefly touching $8,800 level at the beginning of the week. The largest coin has posted losses in last two consecutive days. This downside move is contrary to analyst’s predictions who were expecting a strong rally amid the New York consensus summit. Indeed, Tom Lee – who has predicted Bitcoin price to reach $25K by the end of this year – failed to predict the price movement during the consensus summit correctly.  Tom had anticipated bitcoin price to jump from 10% to 70% amid Coindesks conference. The price movement in the last three days was also quite contrary to historical precedents. BTC coin grew almost $2,000 in the previous year’s conference call, and it had made similar strides in 2014 and 2015. Two consecutive days of downside strides pulled Bitcoin price to an almost four-weeks-lows on Wednesday before moving back to $8,300 today. Although several experts presented the bullish outlook for cryptocurrency market during the New York conference call, bearish remarks from the Federal Reserve President at the beginning of the call created the selloff in the crypto markets. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said cryptocurrencies are operating like non-uniform currencies – which, at least historically, been discarded and replaced in global financial markets. The president also believes that Dollar is in the better position to work as the leader in currency markets. Bullard said. “The dollar, on the other hand, is backed by a stable government with direct and sensical monetary policy and persistently low inflation — because of that, it can better achieve the goals and meet the needs of the market.” The selloff also received support from Bing’s cryptocurrency ad-ban policy. Powered by Microsoft, Bing is the second largest search engine in the world. Bing considers cryptocurrency ads to be harmful to their audience due to their unregulated nature. The Microsoft policymaker said, “Because cryptocurrency and related products are not regulated, we have found them to present a possible elevated risk to our users, with the potential for bad actors participating in predatory behaviors or scamming consumers.” Featured Image: twitter"
0," The Consensus 2018, the largest conference in the crypto world, ended yesterday and many investors and traders are disappointed. Many experts estimated that the conference in New York could spark a much needed rally in bitcoin. However, there was no major upward move in bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies.  According to Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, the prior Consensus rallies have yielded gains between 10% and 70%. Before the conference, he expected the Consensus rally to be even larger this year as ""attendance this year is up dramatically and it’s coming at a time when Bitcoin/Crypto is down YTD [year-to-date]."" Instead, bitcoin, ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash were seen trading with a negative bias. A few probable reasons for no bullish strength could be lack of volumes, over diversification by investors in small cap coins for quick returns, and low liquidity.  Bitcoin
Bitcoin price corrected higher during the past two sessions, but gains were limited by the USD 8,450 and USD 8,500 resistance levels. BTC/USD is currently trading flat near USD 8,250 (GMT 9:00 AM).
It seems like the price is trading in a broad range between USD 8,200 and USD 8,500. It may continue to consolidate before making the next move either towards USD 9,000 or below USD 8,000. Ethereum
Ethereum seems to be struggling to hold gains above USD 700. ETH/USD traded towards the USD 720 resistance, which prevented gains. It is currently up around 1.6% to USD 698, with an immediate resistance at USD 710 and USD 720. 
A push above USD 720 may well open the gates for a run towards USD 750. On the flip side, a break below USD 690 could ignite a fresh bearish wave towards USD 665. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash was able to stay above the USD 1,200 support and recovered more than 2% to USD 1,280. BCH/USD is currently struggling to move above USD 1,300, which is a major barrier for buyers. On the downside, supports are at USD 1,250 and USD 1,240.
Ripple is still capped near the USD 0.70 resistance. XRP/USD is currently up 2.4% to USD 0.687, but buyers are facing tough challenge near USD 0.70. Above this, the price may move towards USD 0.75. Other Altcoins Market Today
Recently, two altcoins, RLC and VERI gained traction and moved up by 39% and 12% respectively. The altcoin market is currently slightly in the green zone with gains between 2-8%. However, there is clearly a lack of strength and buying sentiment."
0," Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped below the $8,500 mark. This is significant news, and it’s likely Bitcoin bears are going to try to drag the currency below the $8,000 mark during the remainder of the week. Will it happen, though? Only time will tell, but we can look to various mediums to see if there is any specific Bitcoin news bringing the price down today, but what may help to turn it around for the coin is Jack Dorsey on BTC— his thoughts are very interesting. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently selling for $8,325.74. This puts BTC down 2.44% in the past twenty-four hours. Right now, Bitcoin (BTC) has a market cap of $141.85 billion, making it the largest digital currency.   Source: CoinMarketCap Most people are hovering over their computers today, watching to see if Bitcoin will drop past $8,000. However, the price of the cryptocurrency is not the only piece of Bitcoin news circulating today. In fact, the CEO of Square and Twitter has been very vocal about Bitcoin (BTC) today, saying he is a “huge fan.”  Jack Dorsey, Square, and Twitter CEO, made these comments on stage at Consensus 2018. The 41-year-old stated that the Internet is “going to have a native currency,” and that instead of waiting for it to happen, we should “help it happen.” When we do have a native currency, however, Dorsey said he doesn’t know if it will end up being BTC, but he has his fingers crossed that it will be.  Hello #Consenus2018! — jack (@jack) May 16, 2018  Dorsey also likely made these comments because using Bitcoin (BTC), or any virtual currency, for that matter, as a global currency will make it easier for his payments company to enter new marketplaces.  So, did the Bitcoin community react positively to Jack Dorsey’s comments at Consensus 2018? On Twitter, there were a number of tweets that seemed to support Dorsey’s ideas. Some accounts shared the news, others thanked the CEO for making comments such as these.  Appreciate your support @Jack. This is great news for all of #crypto and #bitcoin. https://t.co/ctvKhZ4ggu — Bitcoin (@btc) May 16, 2018  “The internet deserves a native currency…it’s going to happen” –@jack — Michael Sonnenshein (@Sonnenshein) May 16, 2018  .@jack: ""The internet deserves a native currency. It will have a native currency…So as a company and as individuals we need to learn how to make that happen…I want to make sure that from a corporate view nothing ever threatens it."" #Consensus2018 #BlockchainWeekNYC — Annaliese Milano (@AnnalieseMilano) May 16, 2018  .@jack's comments at #Consensus2018 seem to indicate Square is very much interested in making #bitcoin more usable for everyone and bring it to the masses. — Kyle Torpey (@kyletorpey) May 16, 2018  As exciting as the Jack Dorsey and Bitcoin news is, we can’t forget that Bitcoin (BTC) is now trading below the $8,500 level. So, what are people saying about the price drop itself? Oddly enough, the Bitcoin Twitter community has been pretty quiet about the price drop. Perhaps it’s because they are too busy biting their nails to tweet.  What do you think of the drop? Featured Image: Depositphotos/© logoff"
0," The past two sessions changed the game for bitcoin and altcoins. Bitcoin price was rejected from the USD 8,750 - USD 8,800 resistance area, resulting in a major bearish move. BTC/USD tumbled by more than USD 500 and tested the USD 8,100 support area. Altcoins market was also dragged lower as most major cryptocurrencies, including ethereum, bitcoin cash, ripple, ADA and neo posted declines between 5%-10%. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price formed a short-term top near USD 8,800 and declined sharply. BTC/USD broke many important support levels, including USD 8,500 to move into a bearish zone. The recent decline was protected by the USD 8,100 support, which acted as a barrier for sellers on many occasions. 
However, it seems like the price may not stay above the stated support for a long time. If buyers fail to hold the USD 8,100 support, bitcoin could decline below USD 8,000. On the other hand, if the price corrects higher, the previous supports at USD 8,400 and USD 8,500 are likely to prevent upsides. Ethereum
Ethereum followed bitcoin’s decline and dropped more than USD 50. More importantly, ETH/USD broke the USD 700 support and traded close to USD 670. The price is currently down 6.1% to USD 685 and it remains at a risk of more losses (GMT 9:00 AM).
An immediate support on the downside is at USD 670. Should there be a break below USD 670, the price may perhaps retest the USD 650 support. On the upside, the price has to move above USD 700 to recover in the short term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash declined sharply and broke the USD 1,300 support. BCH/USD is currently down 12.2% to USD 1,245 with a lot of bearish signs. On the downside, the USD 1,200 support awaits to protect the current decline. Resistances on the upside are at USD 1,280 and USD 1,300.
Ripple trimmed most of its gains and declined below the USD 0.70 support. It is down 8.5% to USD 0.67, with an immediate support at USD 0.65. XRP/USD may correct higher in the short term, but upsides could be capped by USD 0.70. Other Altcoins Market Today
Almost all altcoins registered losses during the past two sessions. A few coins such as Loopring, WAX, GTO, Power Ledger and Zcash remained stable with gains between 2%-8%. The overall market sentiment turned bearish after bitcoin settled below the USD 8,500 support. The next move in BTC/USD depends on how buyers react when the price tests the USD 8,100 and USD 8,000 supports."
0," Bitcoin’s (BTC) bears have unraveled the minor rally in prices since Saturday and are now looking to pull the cryptocurrency below the $8,000 mark, the technical charts indicate. The bears’ comeback comes after bitcoin saw minor gains after the May 12 low of $8,204, but the bulls repeatedly failed to cut through the key falling trendline hurdle. As a result, bitcoin fell to a 3.5-week low of $8,100 on Bitfinex earlier today. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,366 – down 4.7 percent in 24 hours.  The above chart shows that bitcoin has dipped below the 50-day moving average (MA), currently located at $8,290. As discussed yesterday, a close (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA would signal resumption of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 and could yield deeper sell-off to $7,800. The rejection at the descending trendline hurdle and a drop to $8,100 has reinforced the bearish view put forward by the short-term moving averages (5-day and 10-day), which are sloping downwards in favor of the bears. The retreat from $8,884 to $8,100 has also established a falling top (lower highs pattern) – a (you guessed it) bearish setup. While the 10-day MA has crossed the 100-day MA from above (bearish crossover), and the relative strength index (RSI) is also biased bearish (below 50.00 and falling). As a result, there is a high probability that bitcoin will now go on to close today (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA and confirm a bear revival.  The bad news (for the bulls, at least) continues in the 4-hour chart. The downside break of the expanding channel (bearish breakdown) indicates the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990 has resumed and could yield a drop to $7,524 (target as per the measured height method). Note, the major moving averages (50, 100 and 200) are sloping downwards (bearish). Bear graffiti image via Shutterstock"
0," Are you a Bitcoin HODLer? If you are, LedgerX is launching a Bitcoin savings account that might be right up your alley. The cryptocurrency asset management platform, LedgerX, is launching the first Bitcoin (BTC) savings account that will be regulated by the Commodities Future Trading Commission (CFTC), reports Forbes. The goal of the Bitcoin savings account is to provide investors with a fiat-based yield on their Bitcoin holdings. This is done through a simplified version of a call overwrite. All an investor needs to do is choose the implied rate they want to earn and the number of Bitcoins the yield will be applied to. Then, they just need to submit these choices to the LedgerX engine that is already powering their Bitcoin options product. The LedgerX Bitcoin savings account has two CFTC licenses. One is the derivatives clearing organization (DCO) license, and the other is a swap execution facility (SEF) license.  The Bitcoin savings account was designed based on LedgerX’s customer use patterns – but it isn’t for everyone. The product was designed to appeal to long-term Bitcoin investors, those who prefer to HODL than to sell. The point of the accounts is to earn interest off of the Bitcoin that is deposited into them – much in the way a regular savings account works. >> Consensus 2018: NYC Blockchain Week Brings in $17 Million Bitcoin (BTC) is currently selling for $8,534.98, which puts the coin down 2.90% in the past 24 hours. To put that a little more into perspective, this time last year, Bitcoin was selling for $1,728.04, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Those are the kinds of gains that HODLers HODL for. The Bitcoin savings account offered by LedgerX won’t be for everyone. Bitcoin’s volatility is what makes the product work, but the coin’s unpredictability is also what makes it a risky move.

0," The Seminole County of Florida announced on May 14th that starting this summer they will begin accepting cryptocurrency as payment for various services offered by the county, in an attempt to eliminate high fees and improve payment accuracy and efficiency.  According to the official press release, the payment will include services such as property taxes, driver license and ID card fees, as well as tags and titles, and will be done in either Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash. The Seminole County’s tax collector Joel M. Greenberg adds, “We live in a world where technology has made access to services on demand, with same-day delivery and the expectation of highly efficient customer service and we should expect the same from our government. The aim of my tenure in office is to make our customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st century and one way is the addition of cryptocurrency to our payment options.” The county will employ BitPay’s (a bitcoin payment service provider) services, which will allow them to receive settlement the next business day directly to its bank account in US dollars. The county aims to eliminate risks connected to credit card usage, such as fraud and identity theft, through this service. Earlier this month, Berkeley city in California had moved forward with an initiative to apply blockchain technology to public financing to raise funds for community projects. Vice Mayor Ben Barlett told Bloomberg that, should the political process allow it, the city could consider issuing a type of token which would function much like a municipal bond in providing city funding."
0," There were positive moves in the crypto market during the past three sessions as bitcoin, ethereum, ripple, cardano, bitcoin cash and neo traded higher. Almost all large cap and small cap coins rallied and posted decent gains. BTC/USD was successful in holding the USD 8,300 support area and it moved above the USD 8,600 resistance. The current market sentiment is bullish, signaling more gains in bitcoin and altcoins during the coming sessions. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price formed a support above the USD 8,300 level and jumped above the USD 8,600 and USD 8,700 resistance levels. BTC/USD traded above the USD 8,850 level before trimming gains to USD 8,720.
The price is currently (GMT 8:45 AM) up around 3.5% and is placed nicely above the USD 8,600 support. It may well resume its uptrend above the USD 8,700 resistance. However, a proper break and close above the USD 9,000 resistance is required for further upsides. On the downside, USD 8,600, USD 8,500 and USD 8,450 are key support levels. Ethereum
Ethereum moved with a lot of bullish strength and surpassed a crucial hurdle at USD 700. It even traded above the USD 720 resistance and is currently up 3% to USD 730.
It seems like ETH/USD is currently consolidating above the USD 700 level and it is preparing for the next leg above USD 750. If ETH buyers succeed in pushing the price above USD 750, the next barrier awaits near USD 780. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is stable above USD 1,400, but it lacks upward momentum. BCH/USD has to stay above the USD 1,400 support, else it could decline towards USD 1,360. On the upside, it is facing resistances near the USD 1,440 and USD 1,460 levels.
Ripple moved back above the USD 0.70 support, which is a positive sign. XRP/USD is up 2% to USD 0.737 and it may continue to move higher towards the USD 0.75 resistance. Supports are at USD 0.72 and USD 0.70.  Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, Zcash price gained bullish momentum and jumped by more than 40% to break the USD 350 resistance. The key driver for today’s rally was the announcement by the Gemini exchange to support Zcash. A few other altcoins such as Augur, SALT, ENG, HT and WAX also registered gains between 10-20%. Overall, the market is in the green zone with a lot of positive signs for more upsides in the near term."
0," Bitcoin (BTC) is stuck in a narrow $550 range between the key long-term moving averages today, but may be prepping for a breakout, the technical charts suggest. With the bull/bear bias now unclear, the big problem now is trying to work out in which direction the price will go. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,760 on Bitfinex, and is trading between the 50-day moving average (MA) at $8,287 and the 100-day moving average at $8,837. The sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990 came to halt around the 50-day MA on Saturday. Further, the 50-day MA also acted as strong support on Monday. Meanwhile, on both occasions, the rebound from the 50-day MA ran out of steam around the 100-day MA hurdle. The rangebound action seen in the last three days has established the 50-day MA as a major support and the 100-day MA as a formidable resistance and the breakout of this zone will likely set the tone for the next big move in BTC.  On Monday, BTC created a doji  – a candlestick pattern, which indicates indecision in the marketplace. However, when viewed against the backdrop of the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990, the doji signals indecision among the bears (or bearish exhaustion). So, the immediate bearish outlook has been neutralized. A close today (as per UTC) above the 100-day MA of $8,837 would signal bullish doji reversal and upside break of the trading range. Meanwhile, a close below the 50-day MA of $8,287 would confirm downside break of the trading range and bearish doji continuation pattern, i.e. sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 has resumed. That said, the odds of the bullish breakout (or bull doji reversal) still appear low, as the bulls face an uphill task as seen in the chart below.  On the above chart, the falling trendline resistance is seen around $8,810 and is immediately followed by hurdle at $8,910 (expanding channel resistance). With major moving averages (50, 100 and 200) trending south (bearish), BTC bulls will likely struggle to cut through resistance at $8,900 in a convincing manner. Note, the bears are about to score another brownie point by pushing the 50-candle MA below the 200-candle MA (bearish crossover). The 5-day MA and the 10-day MA (seen in the daily chart) are also biased bearish. Another rejection at the descending trendline seen in the 4-hour chart will likely yield a drop to 50-day MA located at $8,287. That said, only a daily close (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA would signal a revival of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 and would allow a deeper drop to $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to the May 5 high) or even as low as $7,698 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July 2015 low to the December 2017 high). On the other hand, a convincing move above $8,910 (expanding channel hurdle) would expose resistance lined up at $9,390. Chalk arrows image via Shutterstock"
1," You may have asked the question: is Bitcoin safe? on multiple occasions. Should you really think to put your money into Bitcoin? Well, Tim Draper is an investor with renowned opinions about the cryptomarket. He is an avid believer in the positivities of crypto and his bullish position has earned him many followers and detractors. On multiple occasions, his predicted forecasts have proved successful despite adverse scenarios, and this is something to take into consideration. A few years ago, Draper predicted that Bitcoin would increase by more than 10k, a figure that only a few believed possible at the time. His prediction was met in about one year. A month ago, Mr. Draper also predicted that Bitcoin would cost 250k by 2022. Quite a controversial and yet not impossible figure compared to Bitcoin’s previous performance over time. This Thursday, in an interview for CNBC, Tim Draper spoke about the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over the traditional FIAT system. For the well-known investor, one of the most important aspects is that of security. If his opinion is to be considered once again, then it would seem that Bitcoin is safer than traditional fiat currency: “Right now, your banks are being attacked all the time. The hackers are poking holes in your banks and going after your fiat money. And the bankers are pounding away trying to keep the hacks away, but they are getting hacked all the time. No-one has ever hacked the Bitcoin blockchain. It is the most secure place to put your money. And so, as a store of value, it is a great place to be. And if you’re in Argentina or Venezuela or Nigeria, you know that your currency is going to fall 30 percent every year, because, I mean, those countries tend to implode about every year. And people lose their fortune. Well, if part of your fortune is put into bitcoin, you’re not going to lose your fortune.” This statement is true, Bitcoin has never been successfully hacked but this still doesn’t make it infallible. Is Bitcoin Safe? Perhaps there could be the use of exchanges as trusted third parties to convert digital resources into cash — just like banks? However, there have been significant hackings into large exchanges resulting in multi-million dollar losses for investors, but this risk is equally there for standard banks. Hacking though in general, is caused by faults in the internal system of the exchanges, as well as by a security failure in the banks. Can it be really be considered a flaw in the actual economic system? For this reason, it is always recommended to store cryptocurrency in a wallet (preferably a cold one) to avoid security breaches inherent in the use of third-party platforms. Mobilizing accounts to exchanges is only recommended for trading, and once finished relocating the crypto to a personal wallet is always recommended. So with that added element – an outside wallet holding your bitcoin, Its fair to say that that makes Bitcoin safer, whether or not more than fiat lies on several factors. You can’t ask “is Bitcoin safe?” without considering another vital aspect that provides security to users; the decentralized nature of crypto. This characteristic means it is out of the control of third parties such as governments or economic influencers. “If you are in Argentina or Venezuela or Nigeria, you know that your currency is going to fall 30% every year because those countries tend to implode about every year, and people lose their fortune. Well, if part of your fortune is put into Bitcoin, you’re not going to lose your fortune.” This statement is critical because in these countries inflation exceeds the Bitcoin’s price volatility. Taking Argentina as an example, the country is so incapable of paying its debt that it had to issue 100-year bonds to try to alleviate the current crisis. A similar situation exists in Venezuela, where the State has stopped issuing official figures, and the calculations are based on figures published by news sites that claim to obtain their data from social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. Some sources even estimate an inflation rate of more than 1000%. >>NYC Blockchain Week: What to expect From Consensus 2018 This Week Other reasons given by Draper for preferring the use of cryptocurrencies over the traditional FIAT system are security, effectiveness, speed, daily use and the potential for additional developments.

1," This past week, there was a strong downward move in bitcoin, ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin and other major cryptocurrencies. BTC/USD pair even broke the USD 9,000 support and tested the next support at USD 8,250. Later, it formed a base and is currently consolidating losses below USD 9,000. It may perhaps continue to trade in a range before it makes the next move. Altcoins also followed bitcoin and declined, but they are now trading in a positive zone. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently (GMT 9:00 AM)  trading flat near USD 8,400, with an immediate support at USD 8,320 followed by the all-important USD 8,250 support. BTC/USD recently traded higher, but it could not surpass a key resistance zone near USD 8,650 - USD 8,700.
The price may continue to trade in a range above USD 8,250 in the short term before the decisive move. There could be two scenarios – first, the price breaks the USD 8,250 support, drops below USD 8,000 and starts a fresh upside wave. Alternatively, the price could move higher and break the USD 8,650 - USD 8,700 resistance.
Weekly resistances are at USD 8,700 and USD 9,000. Supports are at USD 8,250, USD 8,000 and USD 7,500. Ethereum
Ethereum followed bitcoin this past week and tumbled sharply below USD 700 and USD 650. ETH/USD traded towards the USD 625 support before finding strong bids for a recovery.
The pair recovered and is currently up 4.10% to USD 708. It must stay above the USD 700 pivot level to continue moving higher. If buyers fail to keep the price above USD 700, it could retest the USD 650 support during the coming sessions. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price moved into a bearish zone below USD 1,500 this past week. BCH/USD is currently flirting with the USD 1,400 level and is down roughly 2.2%. It may rise in the short term towards USD 1,440, but a break above USD 1,500 is required for a substantial recovery this week.
Ripple is back above USD 0.70 after a major decline. XRP/USD is currently up more than 6.5% to USD 0.7240. The price is currently trading with a positive bias above USD 0.70, and it may climb further towards USD 0.80 and 0.85 during the coming days.  Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, a few small cap altcoins such as Kin, Bytecoin, Nuls, Ark and Fusion climbed higher and gained between 15-40%. The overall technical structure is positive and it seems like the crypto market could gain bullish traction if bitcoin price succeeds in trading above the USD 8,700 and USD 9,000 resistance levels this week."
1," Bitcoin (BTC) is on the back foot having hit three-week lows over the weekend and now risks deeper losses below $8,200, the technical charts indicate. The cryptocurrency fell to $8,204 on Bitfinex on Saturday – the lowest level since April 19 – and was last seen changing hands at $8,365, down around 16 percent from the recent high of $9,990. Note, the bears failed to cut through the support at $8,207 (the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to the May 5 high) in a convincing manner on Saturday. However, the ensuing corrective rally was also short-lived: BTC failed to beat the descending 5-day moving average (MA) hurdle, seen yesterday at $8,760 and fell to a low of $8,271 today. The price action indicates BTC is clearly not out of the woods yet and, if anything, the bear grip seems to have strengthened over the last few days.  The bear flag breakdown indicated on the chart signals a continuation of the sell-off and has opened the doors to $7,300 (target as per the measured height method), although the target looks far fetched as of now. Nevertheless, the pattern does indicate scope for a drop below $8,000. The relative strength index (RSI) is biased to the bears (below 50.00) and the 100-candle moving average (MA) and the 200-candle MA continue to slope downwards, also in favor of the bears.  The chart shows the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 ran out of steam near $10,026 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July 2015 low to the December 2017 high) and the 5-month and 10-month MAs are beginning to slope downwards in favor of the bears for the first time since September 2014. So, the BTC bulls need progress soon, else the 5-month MA will cut the 10-month MA from above (bearish crossover), confirming a long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.  The short-term trend remains bearish as indicated by the downward sloping 5-day and 10-day MAs. This, coupled with the bearish development on the hourly and monthly charts, indicates that bitcoin will likely find acceptance below key support at $8,270 (50-day moving average) and $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to May 5 high). In such a case, bitcoin risks falling below $8,000. BTC looks set to take out support at $8,207 and could then drop to $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to the May 5 high) or even as low as $7,698 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July 2015 low to the December 2017 high). Bullish scenario: Another rebound from $8,207 and a break above $8,760 would open doors for a move back above $9,000. A daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA, currently seen at $9,038 would confirm the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 has ended. Bitcoin and U.S. dollars image via Shutterstock"
0," Ethereum (ETH), and Bitcoin Cash could outplace Bitcoin (BTC) soon due to their superior technology and higher adaptations. Roger Ver – who has earned the moniker “Bitcoin Jesus” for his advocacy of Bitcoin from the early years, believes that Bitcoin could lose its leading position in the cryptocurrency sphere. He says cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) have better technologies and are well positioned to generate substantial gains in the days to come. Ethereum coins currently trade around $700 USD with the market capitalization of $69 billion. Its price and market cap is substantially lower than Bitcoin’s price of $9,000 USD and market cap of over $149 billion. Bitcoin Cash stands at the fourth spot in cryptocurrency ranking – with its price of $1,500 and the market cap of $24 billion. Although Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash price appreciated at a faster pace than bitcoin over the last month, both coins are still standing far behind bitcoin. Roger Ver says Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash will generate massive gains in the days to come compared to Bitcoins modest gains. This movement will allow ETH and BTC to outshine BTC. He said, “I see it happening, and I believe it’s imminent,” Mr. Ver told The Independent. “Ethereum could overtake bitcoin by the end of the year, and bitcoin cash could do the same before 2020.” The Bitcoin expert further claims that the Bitcoin blockchain technology offers slower transaction times and higher fees compared to several other newer technologies. The cryptocurrency market has seen the inclusion of more than 1,500 digital coins since Bitcoin’s commencement in 2009 and each cryptocurrency technology is trying to beat Bitcoin’s flaws. >>Bitcoin Price Drops Below $9,000 He further claims that utility of Bitcoin Cash would allow it to stand at around $100,000 USD in the future. He added, “It’s not guaranteed, but it is much more likely to happen than not. Bitcoin cash has more than doubled in value in the last month, and big investors are coming in soon could see it double again by next week. People love to chase a rising star.” Featured Image: twitter"
0," There was no upside break in bitcoin price above the USD 9,500 resistance, resulting in a downside reaction. The market sentiment was hit hard after Upbit, on of South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, was investigated by local police with charges of fake balance sheet and deceiving investors. Altcoins also tumbled and registered heavy declines. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price struggled to move above the USD 9,500 resistance and declined sharply. There was a sharp downside move in BTC/USD, and the pair broke the USD 9,200 and USD 9,000 support levels. It even settled below USD 9,000 and is currently down 6.2% to USD 8,765 (GMT 9:00). 
The price is clearly trading with a negative sentiment and it may perhaps continue to move down towards USD 8,500. On the upside, the previous support levels at USD 9,000 and USD 9,200 are likely to act as resistances if the price corrects higher. Ethereum
Ethereum also declined sharply and tumbled below the USD 720 and USD 700 support levels. ETH/USD is currently down 8.9% to USD 695, with the next support at USD 680.
If the price fails to stay above the USD 680 support, the next stop for sellers could be USD 650. On the upside, a proper close above USD 720 is must to decrease the current bearish pressure. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash declined sharply by more than 15% and broke the USD 1,500 support. BCH/USD is currently trading near USD 1,400 and it could decline further in the near term. The next support below USD 1,400 awaits at USD 1,360. On the upside, resistances are at USD 1,440 and 1,460, followed by USD 1,500.
Ripple also tumbled by roughly 16% and declined below the USD 0.75 and USD 0.70 support levels. XRP/USD has turned bearish short term and it will most likely accelerate declines towards USD 0.65.  Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, Augur performed well since it was listed on Binance. REP price moved above the USD 50 and USD 60 resistance levels to trade near USD 65. Overall, there was a change in the market sentiment after Upbit’s investigation news. If buyers continue to lose control, there could be more declines in bitcoin and altcoins during the coming sessions."
0," Investment research firm Fundstrat revealed very optimistic predictions yesterday: according to them, by the end of 2019, average price of Bitcoin could reach USD 36,000, with a USD 20,000 - USD 64,000 range. This explosion in price could happen due to crypto mining, as Fundstrat predicts a growth of 350% in hash power (the processing power of the Bitcoin network) through 2019. Sam Doctor, head of data science research at Fundstrat, said in a report that the current path of hash power growth supports the forecast. According to CNBC, during a conference call, Doctor said that the economics of Bitcoin mining likely create a support level for the cryptocurrency, as Bitcoin miners are more likely to hold as the price falls to make up for operating costs, so they sell when the price rises for greater profits: “The primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors.” “The release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex [capital expenditure] as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC price appreciates,” Doctor said. Meanwhile, American technology company Nvidia revealed for the first time how much revenue it generated from sales to miners, and said it expects much smaller figures in the second quarter. According to Bloomberg, Nvidia shares declined as much as 3.8% in extended trading after its earnings were announced. The company adds that crypto miners bought most of their GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), which drove prices up, in turn causing gamers to miss out on the new GeForce GPU."
0," Chinese smartphone giant Huawei has made BTC.com’s Bitcoin wallet app available in its AppGallery, a smartphone marketplace that will come preinstalled on its newest devices – and made available to users of older handsets in “coming months.” Bloomberg quotes Alejandro de la Torre, BTC.com’s vice president of business operations, as saying, “It’s a good opportunity to tap into the Chinese market. The use of cashless payments with apps is very big [in China] and the traditional banking system is lacking, so there’s a good use case for crypto payments to grow there.” The vice president of Huawei’s mobile services, Jaime Gonzalo, said, “From our leadership position in China, the tip of the spear of mobile payments, we expect to see massive growth in global cryptocurrency adoption habits in the near future.” Chinese investors currently have limited access to crytpocurrency apps, as the Google's Play Store is banned in mainland China, and Apple’s App Store is also heavily filtered by the government. Interest in cryptocurrencies remains high in China, despite last year’s initial coin offering (ICO) and exchange platform ban – and mining regulations introduced this year. Many people believe the Chinese smartphone maker is also on the verge of unveiling a blockchain technology-ready handset, following a meeting earlier this year with Sirin Labs, the company who last year unveiled the world’s first blockchain mobile phone."
0," Minsk Transit Bank (MTBank), a Belarus commercial bank, will begin offering a tool that allows its customers to trade Bitcoin against the US dollar. MTBank says, per a statement, trading will be enabled via its MTBankFX foreign exchange platform, and claims users will be able to avoid having to pay taxes on their earnings until 2019. The country has recently legalized cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs), andis attempting to turn itself into the CIS region’s capital of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. In neighboring Ukraine, meanwhile, the head of government’s securities commission this week called for cryptocurrencies to be legalized, as international securities chiefs debate the status of crypto in Budapest. The International Organization of Securities Commissions met this week in the Hungarian capital, with cryptocurrencies high on the agenda. In a Facebook post, Timur Khromaev, the chairman of Ukraine’s National Securities and Stock Market Commission, and the head of the Committee on Development Strategy and Economic Analysis of Stock Markets, said he and his international counterparts had been discussing “cryptocurrencies and ICOs,” with “several conclusions already being drawn.” “We have passed the point of no return. Cryptocurrencies’ status […] must be adopted by the law and standardized by [Ukrainian] financial regulators,” Khromaev wrote, noting that he now intends to raise the matter with the central bank’s Financial Stability Council. Khromaev also stated, “International standards are still a way off, so cryptocurrency rules and regulations need to first be developed at the national level.”"
0," Bitcoin (BTC) hit a three-week low of $8,713 on Bitfinex earlier today and looks set to extend losses further, price chart analysis indicates. The cryptocurrency failed to cut through the descending (bearish) 5-day moving average (MA) located at $9,382 yesterday, despite the bullish falling channel breakout on May 9, and fell below the $9,000 mark as anticipated. As of writing, BTC is changing hands around $8,800 – below the 100-day moving average (MA) of $8,849 and down 2.42 percent from the previous day’s close (as per UTC) of $9,018. The 10 percent decline from the recent high of $9,990 has weakened the bulls and has boosted the odds of a deeper drop to the 50-day moving average lined up at $8,282.  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows BTC closed (as per UTC) yesterday below $9,149 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement), pushing indicators into bearish territory. For instance, the relative strength index (RSI) has dipped below 50.00, confirming a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change and opening the doors for a further drop in prices. The 5-day MA and the 10-day MA are both trending south, having witnessed a bearish crossover earlier this week. On the 4-hour chart, BTC has breached the trendline support in a convincing manner, and the 50-candle and 100-candle MAs have topped out (shed bullish bias). The cryptocurrency looks set to test the gradually ascending (mildly bullish) 200-candle MA located just above the $8,628 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement, seen in the daily chart). However, the moving average support may hold ground for a few hours as the relative strength index (RSI) shows oversold conditions.  The 50-hour MA, 100-hour MA, and 200-hour MA are trending south and positioned one below the other in favor of the bears. Yet, the RSI on the 60-minute chart also shows oversold conditions. So, a minor corrective rally cannot be ruled out. Bitcoin and chart image via Shutterstock"
0," When you amass a fortune in digital currency, you still have to keep it somewhere. Imagine becoming a Bitcoin billionaire - how would you guard your hoard? In your old apartment? Or in vaults behind guards, reinforced concrete and blast doors? Xapo, a startup founded by Argentine entrepreneur Wences Casares, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.  Xapo's global bitcoin storage network Two Xapo clients say his startup is the home to approximately USD 10 billion in Bitcoin, according to Bloomberg. The company, of course, does not store Bitcoin itself, but rather the private keys of their clients. Inside the Xapo Swiss vault  The cache would amount to around 7% of the global Bitcoin supply, which places the startup above 98% of the US banks by deposit amount. The company has vaults on five continents and guarding it is not an easy desk job where you can watch movies when nothing is happening: Xapo's head of security, Carlos Rienzi, said for Quartz last year that the situation is: “under attack 24/7. This is not a race. It is a chess game. You have to think about the opponent’s next movement. You can never relax.” CoinShares, a crypto investment company, for example, has more than USD 500 million at Xapo, and their CEO Ryan Radloff says, “You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.” As the level of security for smaller-scale wallets, both software and hardware, rises, hackers find themselves unable to apply their usual methods of stealing funds, so they have to resort to more traditional ways: the number of crypto robberies at gunpoint is increasing."
0," Despite a brief rally yesterday, bitcoin (BTC) is still in corrective mode and risks falling back below $9,000, chart analysis suggests. The cryptocurrency broke out of the bearish falling channel setup Wednesday, courtesy of a bullish relative strength index (RSI) divergence – indicating the pullback from the recent high of $9,990 had ended at a low of $8,980. The breakout also raised the prospects of a stronger move towards $9,767 (April 25 high) and possibly even the $10,000 mark. However, the ascent has been cut short around $9,380 in the last 15 hours, as seen in the hourly chart below.  As of writing, bitcoin is attempting a break above $9,380 on Bitfinex, above which a major resistance is seen at $9,442 – the 200-hour moving average (MA). Meanwhile, a strong support is seen at $9,228 (marked by a circle). The momentum studies are biased bearish. For instance, the 100-hour MA is trending south in favor of the bears and the 50-hour MA is still gradually descending (yet to bottom out or shed bearish bias). As a result, a convincing move above $9,442 could be a tough task. Further, the short-term moving averages in the daily chart have rolled over in favor of the bears.  The bearish crossover between the 5-day MA and the 10-day MA indicates a short-term (5 days) bullish-to-bearish trend change. It also indicates the pullback from the recent high of $9,990 has not run its course. Arrows image via Shutterstock"
0," Venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya has countered billionaire Warren Buffett’s recent derogatory statements on bitcoin, stating that the cryptocurrency is “important.” His comments come after Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, argued that bitcoin is more of a gamble than an investment at the end of April, and then, last weekend at a shareholders’ meeting, he said bitcoin is “probably rat poison squared.” While calling himself a Buffett “disciple,” Palihapitiya told CNBC that Buffett is wrong about bitcoin. “Not everybody is right all the time,” he told the news source, further suggesting that that knowledge about technology is not in Buffett’s “circle of competence.” Palihapitiya, a former Facebook and AOL executive, went on to push for the cryptocurrency’s benefits, saying it is a replacement to gold and: “Something like bitcoin is really important, because it is not correlated to the rest of the market.” Speaking about the financial crisis, he said that “things that we thought were hedges went away” and “broke down.” Bitcoin is viewed as providing a hedge to traditional finance by those who have owned the digital currency, he said.

1," Bitcoin price (BTC) plummeted sharply in the last two days following Bill Gates and Warren Buffett’s criticism regarding the cryptocurrency markets. The largest coin traded at around the $9,000 level early today, down almost $1,000 from Sunday’s high of $9,900. Altcoins fell at a high mid-single-digit rate in the last two days, pulling the total cryptocurrency market capitalization to the lowest level in the last week. Despite this, another Tom Lee prediction has surfaced. Bears are on top of the market as business icons have called cryptocurrency markets a “greater fool theory“. However, Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, predicts bitcoin price to rally 70% next week. The cryptocurrency market expert based his claim entirely on the upcoming New York Consensus Summit beginning May 14. Almost 7,000 blockchain and Bitcoin enthusiasts will take part in the conference. Tom Lee believes that these passionate players will optimize trader’s sentiments leading Bitcoin price to generate substantial gains.  “Already one of the largest crypto conferences in the world, attendance this year is up dramatically and coming at a time when Bitcoin/Crypto is down YTD. Hence, we expect the Consensus rally to be even larger than past years,” Tom Lee says. Is this Tom Lee Prediction a Fairy Tale? It will be quite tricky for bulls to create and sustain any rally that is based on speculations and bullish calls. Warren Buffett and Bill Gates have already criticized cryptocurrency markets on these types of predictions and artificial price hikes. Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency market need structural support to push prices higher instead of speculations. Market pundits are also raising questions on the topic of regulatory roles in cryptocurrency markets during the Consensus Conference summit – which they believe will have a negative impact on Bitcoin price. Tom Lee, however, believes that commentary surrounding regulation won’t hinder the rally saying: “While regulation is sure to be a topic of conversation, [I] don’t expect this to hinder, the impending rally.” Featured Image: Twitter"
1," In an effort to show prospective Lightning Network users how the experience should look in the not-too-distant future, Lightning Labs, a developer of the network, in a blog post introduced Carol, a new Lightning user, and through her example show their vision and some projects they are working on. The idea of the network is that transacting and settling would be done off-blockchain, so the fees are low and thanks to the implementation of smart contracts for security, the payments can be instant - no waiting time for block confirmation. Also, another important factor is its scalability, which is supposed to make it possible for millions to billions of transactions per second to take place across the network.  Once the initial infrastructure components are complete, a Day in the life of Carol, or a new user of Lightning, would start with installing the Lightning app on her phone. Then Carol sets it up like she would a Bitcoin wallet, writing down a backup seed password that will allow her to retrieve her money should she lose her phone. Then, she sends herself some Bitcoin from an exchange using a QR code from the app. As she waits for the initial deposit to clear, her app is synchronizing with the Neutrino protocol that allows low-power devices, in our case smartphones, to use Bitcoin with a high degree of privacy and security. Afterwards, Autopilot system moves Carol’s money to the Lightning network - another waiting time of about an hour, that happens only the first time. The blog post goes on to explain how she uses her app’s integrated point-of-sale system to buy anything she needs with a transaction fee of less than one cent, to buying “Devout Shoulders” in her favorite video game, all the way to adding new funds from an exchange. The Lightning Network is still away from this future, however. As their goal is simplifying the user experience so that Carol doesn’t need to know about cryptography or game theory to use cryptocurrency, the team is working on various components that will make up the Lightning Network, that they promise to be writing more on."
1," Yesterday, there was a decent upward move in bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. However, buyers failed to gain bullish momentum, resulting in a fresh round of selling. BTC/USD failed to move above the USD 9,600 resistance and declined back towards USD 9,000. Similarly, Ethereum failed to hold the USD 750 support and retested the USD 700-710 support zone. At the outset, both bitcoin and Ethereum are now trading near crucial supports, which must hold to avoid further declines. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently down 2.8% to USD 9,130 (GMT 9:00) and is struggling to move above the USD 9,200 resistance. Above the USD 9,200 resistance, the next immediate resistance is at USD 9,250. An hourly close above USD 9,250 may perhaps decrease the current bearish pressure and the price might recover towards USD 9,500.
On the downside, the USD 9,000 level is a crucial support. Should buyers fail to hold bitcoin price above USD 9,000, there could be another round of heavy selling in the short term. Ethereum
Ethereum trimmed most of its gains and declined by more than 4% to USD 725. ETH/USD just managed to hold the USD 700 support, which is also the last line of defense. 
On the upside, the price is facing hurdles near USD 740. Therefore, a convincing push above USD 740 may open the doors for further upsides towards the USD 760 and USD 780 levels. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash moved below the USD 1,600 support to post more than 7% losses. BCH/USD is currently trading near the USD 1,520 level, with an immediate support at USD 1,500. On the upside, the previous support at USD 1,580 may perhaps act as a resistance.
Ripple declined sharply and broke the USD 0.82 and USD 0.80 support levels. XRP/USD is currently down 6.5% to USD 0.77 and is trading in a bearish zone. The previous supports at USD 0.80 and USD 0.82 will most likely act as hurdles for an upside recovery. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, a few small cap altcoins such as Pundi X, Augur, Nexo, Ethos and ZIL posted more than 10% gains. Other than these, most altcoins struggled and posted losses.  The overall market sentiment is slightly bearish, and if bitcoin price fails to stay above USD 9,000, there could be more declines in the near term."
1," Having hit seven-day lows below $9,000 this morning, bitcoin (BTC) is looking decidedly weak. The cryptocurrency fell to $8,980 on Bitfinex a few hours ago and was last seen changing hands at $9,080 – down 1.13 percent from the previous day’s close (as per UTC) of $9,184. The downwards move does not come as a surprise, however, with the bear flag breakdown witnessed yesterday opening the doors for a fall to $8,865. Now, unless the bulls can make a defense of support at $9,055 (seen in chart below), the cryptocurrency risks once more falling below $8,000.  Bitcoin risks a deeper sell-off to $8,652 (April 26 low) if the failure to beat inverse head-and-shoulders neckline hurdle (as seen over the weekend) is followed by a 4-hour close below the trendline support, currently seen at $9,055. The 50-candle and 100-candle moving averages (MAs) have shed bullish bias (topped out) and BTC is trading well below other key moving averages. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) is holding well below 50.00 (in the bearish territory), also signaling scope for further losses. Additionally, the action in the hourly chart below also suggests that BTC is risking a move downwards. As of writing, BTC is trading on a weaker footing as indicated by the series of lower highs and lower lows, represented by the falling channel (bearish pattern). The 50-hour, 100-hour and 200-hour MAs are all biased to the bears (trending south). The bear flag breakdown, seen yesterday, also favors a drop below $9,055. The only factor that might stall the decline is the bullish relative strength index (RSI) divergence. Note that the RSI has not formed lower lows in response to lower lows in prices.

0," Bitcoin.com Controversy: Bitcoin Cash has taken things a little too far on its crusade to promote itself, A strategy that has led the ecosystem to a polarization never seen before in the history of the blockchain. While the relationship between ETC advocates and ETH could be described as controversial — two communities whose philosophies are radically different and are critical of each other — the relationship between BTC and its fork BCH is worse and now the lack of seriousness from camp BCH in their strategies has reached a limit. In recent weeks, the actions of Roger Ver – the man at the head of the BCH community, began listing BCH as Bitcoin which angered users. Ver, who owns Bitcoin.com has used the site to promote specific tactics that have been described by many as misleading. A few weeks ago, a community initiative began to gather momentum, seeking to sue Roger Ver for confusing users by listing BCH under the name Bitcoin, when in reality Bitcoin is BTC in all markets. Not only content with that, Ver decided to list the real BTC under the name Bitcoin Core, when Bitcoin Core is the name of the famous Satoshi Client and the original bitcoin wallet.   Because of actions like these, users disapproved of the way BCH adopters promoted the currency. As a result of the complaints, Bitcoin.com listed BCH as Bitcoin Cash and BTC as Bitcoin again on some parts of its website. However, four days ago when Twitter account @bitcoin called BTC “an experimental coin with no whitepaper”, it was the straw that broke the camel’s back, provoking reactions from important personalities like Mike Novogratz who responded in a very heated tone: Bitcoin Cash is the oldest cryptocurrency. Its white paper was published in 2008 and the genesis block mined in January 2009.  Bitcoin Core (BTC) is an experimental currency that does not have a white paper and has only operated under its current model for two years. pic.twitter.com/YBeepJlwC5 — Bitcoin (@Bitcoin) May 4, 2018  As a result of the Bitcoin.com controversy, Coinmarketcap, one of the reference sites when researching the status and characteristics of cryptos around the world, decided to remove Bitcoin.com from the list of official Bitcoin websites.  This was inevitable. Bitcoin.com is possibly the number one searched domain name when looking for information regarding Bitcoin – even more than bitcoin.org which is now the only official website. The kind of controversy that Bitcoin.com is stirring up means it doesn’t hold a neutral position regarding cryptos. This seems to warrant its removal from one of the worlds biggest crypto related platforms.  >>The New York Stock Exchange Has its Eyes on Trading Bitcoin Another reference website – CoinCall, listed BCH as the “shitcoin with the most market cap. The reasons for such a decision are explained on a popup: “intentionally misleading newcomers to believe it’s the ‘real’ Bitcoin, for example by misusing bitcoin.com and the @bitcoin Twitter handle.”  So far there have been no comments from Roger Ver or the bitcoin.com team. It is quite obvious that the Bitcoin.com controversy has ruffled industry feathers. However, it is important to note that Bitcoin.com is still one of the official forums for the most popular cryptocurrency on the market. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© mdkhalil1"
0," Warren Buffet may still dislike Bitcoin (BTC), but many other big names on Wall Street seem to be warming up to the digital currency.  The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), has been working on an online trading platform that gives institutional investors access to buy and hold BTC. The New York Times reported late Monday that the plans are still ‘confidential’ and the four individuals that briefed the publication on the matter asked to remain anonymous. This news broke following Goldman Sachs’ grand announcement to be the first Wall Street bank to open up its own Bitcoin trading unit. May 3: Goldman Sachs says it will operate a bitcoin futures market. May 8: According to NYTimes, New York Stock Exchange, the world’s biggest stock market, is preparing a *proper bitcoin exchange* not futures. 2018 is looking more interesting!https://t.co/yd0WsTEjy2 — Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) May 8, 2018 ICE and Goldman Sachs aren’t the only big Wall Street hitters to enter into the crypto space recently. Nasdaq partnered with the large cryptocurrency exchange Gemini just a few weeks ago, to get its foot in the Bitcoin futures game. Even the long-time anti-Bitcoin bank JPMorgan has turned a new leaf. Back in October of last year,  the institution filed for a patent to use blockchain technology in its network payments. These moves mark a dramatic shift toward mainstream adoption for the digital currency. >> Goldman Sachs Bitcoin Futures Swap Contracts The NYSE-parent recently held various conversations with large US financial institutions about potential ‘swap’ contracts. In a swap, banks would buy a contract that would give one of its customer’s Bitcoin the very next day. According to the individuals working on the project with ICE, these contracts would be backed and secured by the exchange. While these swap contracts may seem more complex than just trading USD for BTC on an exchange like the rest of us; these particular trades come under the regulation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The swap trades operate clearly under the current laws, something exchanges have yet to do. Adena Friedman, CEO of NASDAQ, recently said her company would create a cryptocurrency exchange if the regulatory issues were ironed out by the U.S govt. What do you think about the latest news? Is this just the beginning? Leave your comments below. Featured Image: Canva"
0," Bill Gates says he would short Bitcoin “if there was an easy way to do it” on CNBC’s Squawk Box and of course the community doesn’t stay silent. Tyler Winklevoss, early Bitcoin investor and co-founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, did not pass up the opportunity to tell him how to do it exactly. “Dear @BillGates there is an easy way to short bitcoin. You can short #XBT, the @CBOE Bitcoin (USD) Futures contract, and put your money where your mouth is!” tweeted the young entrepreneur on Monday afternoon. Futures let traders bet on the price of an asset, in this case Bitcoin, at a point months later. A trader who sells a futures contract in anticipation of a decline in Bitcoin price makes money if the price does drop. Trading to benefit from a decline is known as shorting. The rest of the community spoke out as well. To his “greater fool theory” comment, Reddit user billbacon commented, “At least that’s a step up from tulips,” referencing how analysts often compare Bitcoin to the infamous tulip bubble.  Another user, tldrtldrtldr says that Gates actually shorting Bitcoin may not be a bad thing either: “Shorting is great for true price discovery. By all means he should short it. If Bitcoin has legs it will rise. If it fails, it was a bubble all along. Let the market settle this.”"
0," Bitcoin’s fall from almost USD 20,000 is directly tied to the launch of a futures market, according to research from the San Francisco Federal Reserve published on Monday.  “The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence. It is consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the introduction of futures markets for an asset,” four researchers wrote in the bank's most recent Economic Letter. They add that until futures existed it was extremely difficult, if not impossible, to bet on the decline of Bitcoin prices. The cryptocurrency rose more than 1,300% in 2017 as optimistic investors continued to bid up. “The pessimists, however, had no mechanism available to put money behind their belief that the bitcoin price would collapse. So they were left to wait for their “I told you so” moment,” the researchers explain. As for why it was a gradual fall rather than an overnight collapse, researchers said it could be a lack of attention or willingness to enter the market on the first week of trading. Future prices and demand could be helped by any traditional financial institutions becoming more willing to accept Bitcoin, and official recognition and regulatory acceptance of Bitcoin as a means of payments, they wrote. Once speculative demand by optimists and pessimists balances out, the research offers some insights into where the fundamental price of Bitcoin could go. “Given that there is no actual asset that backs the value of Bitcoin [...] what will eventually determine the “fundamental” price of Bitcoin is transactional demand relative to supply,” explains the text. Until then, the price is most likely to remain its old volatile self. Futures contracts, also referred to as futures, are standardized exchange-traded financial derivatives that provide an agreement between a buyer and a seller to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a predefined date. Each futures contract represents a specific amount of the underlying asset and futures can be either cash settled or come with physical delivery. In the case of bitcoin futures, the underlying asset is the digital currency bitcoin."
0," After a substantial downside correction, bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies found support. BTC/USD buyers successfully defended the USD 9,200 support, and ethereum stayed above the USD 700 handle. Later, the crypto market sentiment improved and prices recovered above key resistance levels. Technically, it seems like a correction wave is complete and prices may resume its uptrend. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently trading 0.45% up to USD 9,400 (around GMT 9:00 AM). To gain upside momentum, BTC/USD has to move above the USD 9,600 resistance level. Should buyers succeed in clearing the USD 9,600 resistance, the next stop could be the all-important USD 10,000.
On the flip side, if the price moves down once again, the USD 9,200 support may perhaps prevent losses. Below this the price might test the USD 9,000 level.
In the short-term, the price may trade in a range below USD 9,600 before making the next move. Ethereum
Ethereum bounced back sharply from the USD 700 barrier. ETH/USD traded above the USD 750 resistance and is currently trading 1.78% higher to USD 758. 
The price is facing resistance near the USD 770 level. A successful break above the stated resistance will most likely push the price above USD 800. On the downside, supports are visible near USD 750 and USD 740. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash was well bid around the USD 1,550 support. BCH/USD recovered nicely and moved above the USD 1,600 resistance. On the upside, a break above the USD 1,680 resistance is required for a push towards the USD 1,750 level.
Ripple stayed above the USD 0.82 support and is currently up 1% to USD 0.8320. XRP/USD is facing a tough resistance at USD 0.85, which prevented gains on many occasions earlier. Above USD 0.85, the price could retest the USD 0.90 level. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, Bytecoin got heavily bid after it was listed on one of the major cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. BCN price jumped by more than 100% and traded above USD 0.014.  A few other small cap altcoins such as 0x, ZIL, Ethos, Loom Network, Holo, Pundi X and Cortex gained more than 10% today. Overall, there are many positive signs in the market, but a break above USD 9,600 is needed in bitcoin for bullish continuation."
0," Following the announcement about opening a Bitcoin trading unit made by Goldman Sachs, some of the biggest names on Wall Street seem to be warming up to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general, The New York Times reports. According to people who wished to remain anonymous due to the plans still being confidential, as well as documents and emails seen by NYT, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been working on an online trading platform for large investors to buy and hold (or HODL) Bitcoin. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE, the parent company of the NY Stock Exchange) and Goldman mark the first foray into the as of yet unregulated world of cryptocurrency. Since details of the ICE platform are still not finalized, there is a chance that the project could fall apart, given the reluctance usually shown by the Wall Street in terms of crypto. The New York Times further reports ICE having had conversations with financial institutions about implementing so-called swaps, which mean banks buying contracts that end with a customer owning Bitcoin the next day, citing people familiar with the matter. Although the swap is slightly more complicated than simply buying crypto for an amount of USD, it would allow the trading to come under the regulation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, operating under existing laws. The possible move would fall in line with the general trend of increasing warmth towards the crypto industry: only recently, the CEO of Nasdaq said the company could become a crypto exchange as well as soon as the industry matures. However, not everyone is as thrilled: Warren Buffett is steadfast on his negative opinion and the only thing that changes is how he expresses his distaste."
0," Bitcoin dropped to four-day lows below $9,200 on Monday and now looks set to explore levels below the $9,000 mark, the technical charts indicate. Yesterday’s downwards move meant the cryptocurrency closed below the 10-day moving average (MA) – signaling short-term bullish invalidation – having failed to beat the key inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance over the weekend. As of writing, BTC is trading at $9,357 on Bitfinex – largely unchanged on the day, but down 6.3 percent from the recent high of $9,990. Worryingly for the bulls, the price chart analysis indicates the losses could be extended further over the next 24 hours.  The inverted flag (also known as a bear flag) breakdown suggests the sell-off from the high of $9,990 has resumed and BTC could drop to $8,865 (target as per the measured height method – pole height subtracted from breakdown price). The momentum studies also favor the bears, with both the 50-hour moving average (MA) and 100-hour MA showing a bearish bias (sloping downwards). Further, the 50-hour MA looks set to cut the 200-hour MA from above (bearish crossover).  As noted earlier, BTC closed below the 10-day MA yesterday, signaling that the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 has made a temporary top at $9,990. Further, BTC’s attempt to retake the 10-day MA failed earlier today and the 5-day MA has adopted a bearish bias. As a result, the cryptocurrency looks likely to find acceptance below the ascending trendline (drawn from the April 18 low and May 1 low) and possibly drop below the $9,000 mark in the next 24 hours or so.

0," The bitcoin expert and senior market analyst at eToro, Mati Greenspan, explained that Bitcoin’s behavior is completely normal and that after reaching historical highs of around 20k a drop like the one seen during the first quarter of 2018 was to be expected.  In an interview for The Express Mr. Greenspan mentioned that technical analysis better explains the reasons for the fall in Bitcoin prices than fundamental analysis. “I believe that more than fear of regulation that decline from the 20,000 peak was more of just a normal retracement.” Mr. Greenspan is a fervent advocate that markets move in trends and cycles, so a behavior as bullish as that seen during the last quarter of 2017 could only have a subsequent bearish after-effect. For him, this type of “retracement” had already occurred on previous occasions, to give rise to a greater bullish impulse later: “Whenever the price moves and jumps into a new order of magnitude, we need to see some sort of retracement on that. It’s the same thing that when it jumped up from eight cents to $3.50, then it had a retracement back to a dollar, that’s a very normal thing after that kind of leap. So if we look at it now, I believe we are about five or six percent up over the price a year ago.“ For Greenspan, expectations are very high. According to his comparisons, Bitcoin is in a better position today than in previous years, which “without a doubt” implies a reasonable probability that bitcoin will beat last year’s all-time high. According to technical analyses, bitcoin is showing a breakdown of what is known as a “triangle pattern” – a market behavior in which dips get higher up and peaks get lower and lower.   Analysts define the triangle pattern as a search for equilibrium, meaning that when this figure is broken, or when the apex is reached, the path taken represents a strong future trend. In the case of Bitcoin, it is clear that that the market’s behavior broke the triangle on an upward path. This could be a good start towards fulfilling the forecasts of Mr. Greenspan, who, despite his bullish statements, did not cease to be conservative, saying “I don’t know what’s going to happen in the future. I’m really not a fortune teller or anything like that.” Featured Image: Depositphotos/© mdkhalil1"
0," Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates told CNBC’s Squawk Box program that he would short Bitcoin if there was an easy way to do it. “As an asset class, you're not producing anything and so you shouldn't expect it to go up. It's kind of a pure 'greater fool theory' type of investment,” he said. He apparently used to HODL Bitcoin for a few years, having been gifted a certain amount for his birthday, but that he sold it. He explains, “Bitcoin and ICOs [initial coin offerings], I believe completely [they're some] of the crazier, speculative things.” Of course, he’s not too far off from most negative opinions regarding Bitcoin, and similarly, he believes in blockchain as a technology and can see how it could be implemented. Gates is on the board of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and was speaking from Omaha, Nebraska, where the conglomerate held its annual shareholders meeting over the weekend. Interestingly, it was only recently that Buffett called Bitcoin “rat poison,” while cryptocurrency enthusiasts gathered on the social media website Reddit to pitch the idea that his opinion probably stems from fear, due to most of his fortune coming out of more traditional venues. This is also not the first time Gates has offered his negative opinion on crypto: his past foray into crypto-commenting was deemed unimaginative and uninformed, as he had gone for the old adage that crypto is only used by criminals."
0," This past week, there was a solid bullish trend established in bitcoin and altcoins. BTC/USD traded above the USD 9,500 resistance and even broke the USD 10,000 level. However, buyers could not hold the momentum above the USD 10,000 level, resulting in a downside reaction. At the outset, the current price action suggests that buyers are losing grip. Therefore, there could be more declines in bitcoin and altcoins before the start of a fresh upside wave. Bitcoin
Today’s technical indicators are pointing a bearish price action in Bitcoin. BTC/USD has trimmed more than USD 500 and is currently trading near USD 9,400 (GMT 9:00 AM). On the upside, resistances are at USD 9,500 and USD 9,600.
A successful close above the USD 9,600 resistance may perhaps push the price towards the all-important USD 10,000. Finally, a proper close above USD 10,000 is a must for bullish continuation.
On the downside, the previous resistance near USD 9,250 is a key support. If the price fails to hold the USD 9,250 support, there could be more losses. Weekly supports below USD 9,250 are USD 9,000 and 8,450. Ethereum
Ethereum trimmed more than 10% of its last week gains. ETH/USD declined from well above USD 830 to USD 730. At present, the price is down 4.9% to USD 740 with bearish signs. Weekly supports on the downside are at USD 720 and USD 700. 
On the flip side, if the price moves higher, it could face sellers near USD 760. Above this last, the main weekly resistances are at USD 800 and USD 830. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash declined more than USD 200 from the USD 1,850 high. BCH/USD is currently under a bearish pressure and is trading above the USD 1,600 support. A break below the USD 1,600 support may perhaps push the price towards USD 1,500.
Ripple trimmed most of its last week gains and settled below USD 0.90 and USD 0.85. XRP/USD is now approaching the USD 0.80 support where buyers are likely to appear.  Other Altcoins Market Today
Most small cap altcoins enjoyed solid gains this past week. However, it seems like they are losing momentum and are at risk of more declines. Today’s best performer is BitcoinDark, which surged by more than 40% and traded towards USD 175.  To sum up, the crypto market is showing a few bearish signs, but if bitcoin stays above the USD 9,250 support, there could be a fresh bullish wave."
0," After an investor and one of the richest man in the world Warren Buffett once again offered his ever-constant insight into crypto, this time calling Bitcoin “probably rat poison squared,” theories abound on why he is so dead-set on proving to the world that crypto is evil personified. The time, the Oracle of Omaha was speaking at the annual Berkshire Hathaway, an American multinational conglomerate holding company, run by Buffett, shareholder meeting on Saturday. One of the theories that seems to hold most merit is that Buffett’s obvious distaste for all things related to cryptocurrency is based in fear: among Berkshire Hathaway's biggest holdings are traditional financial institutions such as Wells Fargo (the largest by far), Goldman Sachs or Bank of New York Mellon. As the Redditor et-nad who first pointed this out puts it, “His firm will collapse if he started supporting crypto. Not surprised.” Buffett’s words should not be taken as scripture in the cryptoverse, and his support, or lack thereof, is not hindering the adoption of crypto all that much, according to other Redditors who had joined the discussion. “Buffet likes slow, steady, stable, proven industries that produce small but consistent returns. Crypto definitely doesn't fit into any of the above categories,” says one. Another points out that his loud hatred is perhaps unwarranted: “I like red sauce pasta. It doesn't mean I should go bashing white sauce pasta,” comparing it to Buffett’s general reactions. Another replied, “Go take your reasonable, well-adjusted outlook on life elsewhere. Your kind isn't welcomed here.” Buffett has a history of being wrong about new technologies: only recently, he admitted he was wrong about both Google and Amazon, having expressed his disbelief in the companies when they first emerged. In either case, Berkshire Hathaway keeps growing. Its revenues stood at USD 242 billion last year, or 8% more than in 2016. While it assets increased by 13%, to USD 702.1 billion, in the same period, according to the annual report of the company."
0," Researchers from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank’s San Francisco division believe that the launch of bitcoin futures on several marketplaces in the U.S. last December played a role in a subsequent slump in the cryptocurrency’s price. According to a research paper published on Monday, the authors  – including three researchers from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco as well as a finance professor from Stanford University – believe bitcoin’s recent price trend is somewhat similar to how the housing bubble developed in the U.S. during the 2000s. And the introduction of bitcoin-related derivatives played a part in that trend, the authors wrote. As previously reported by CoinDesk, the Cboe and CME Group moved their bitcoin futures products to the market near the end of the year after obtaining approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). It was around this time that the price of bitcoin nearly hit $20,000 after surging throughout that year, only to fall close to $6,000 by the end of the first week of February. Citing data and calculations conducted through their research, the Fed paper’s authors argue that the “rapid rise of the price of bitcoin and its decline following [the] issuance of futures on the CME is consistent with pricing dynamics suggested elsewhere in financial theory.” Such pricing dynamics, as the researchers explained, refer to a trend where demand for a financial instrument is initially driven by optimists who push up the price until the point where the market introduces a mechanism that allows pessimists to invest reversely. The researchers argued: “And until December 17, those investors [optimists] were right: As with a self-fulfilling prophecy, optimists’ demand pushed the price of bitcoin up, energizing more people to join in and keep pushing up the price. The pessimists, however, had no mechanism available to put money behind their belief that the bitcoin price would collapse. So they were left to wait for their ‘I told you so’ moment.” That said, such trends may not continue indefinitely, as the authors further suggested. As the bitcoin mining process goes on and fewer coins become available (as a result of the scheduled halving of the network subsidy, now pegged at 12.5 BTC per block), the authors argue that the transactional function of bitcoin as a payment method could play a leading role in driving its value as “speculative dynamics disappear.” Read the full Fed paper below: FedBTCPaper by CoinDesk on Scribd  U.S. dollar image via CoinDesk"
0," Bitcoin’s (BTC) pullback in prices over the weekend has dampened the immediate prospects for the bulls, the technical studies indicate. Having witnessed a bullish pennant breakout last Friday, the cryptocurrency looked set to scale the $10,000 mark in a convincing manner over the weekend. However, the bullish move unexpectedly ran out of steam at $9,990 at 13:00 UTC on Saturday, according to Bitfinex, and had retreated to $9,258 earlier today. As of writing, bitcoin is changing hands at $9,400, representing a 2.67 percent drop from the previous day’s close of $9,658. While the pullback is not good for the bulls, only a drop below $8,650 would give the bears the upper hand.  The above chart shows the pullback occurred after BTC was rejected (marked by a circle) at the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance of $9,950. As noted above, BTC had looked on a solid ground following the bull pennant breakout, so the drop to $9,300 came as something of a surprise and has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook. That said, a rebound from the ascending (bullish) 100-candle moving average (MA) in the 4-hour chart could put $10,000 back on the map.  The daily chart shows that the 10-day MA is sloping upwards (bullish), providing more cause for bull optimism, especially if today’s candle closes (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA (located at $9,468). On the other hand, if BTC closes below the 10-day MA, then the case for a further drop towards $8,652 (April 26 low and pennant low as seen in 4-hour chart) would strengthen. The pullback from $9,990 to $9,258 has dampened the immediate bullish outlook. Repeated failure on the part of the bears to keep prices below the ascending 100-candle MA on 4-hour chart, and a close today above the 10-day MA of $9,468, could yield re-test of $10,000. A close above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance seen today at $9,980, would open the doors to $13,475 (target as per the measured height method), although the target looks far-fetched for now. In the short-run though, BTC could rise to $11,700 on the back of an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout. Bearish scenario: A break below $8,652 (pennant low) would add credence to rejection at inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance and signal a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change. In such a case, BTC will likely drop to levels below $8,000. Bitcoin chart image via Shutterstock"
1," After announcing their intent to file a lawsuit for fraud against Bitcoin.com for labeling Bitcoin Cash “Bitcoin” and the real Bitcoin “Bitcoin Core,” the pro-BTC community has reversed this plan on their Telegram channel on May 3rd, citing lack of funds. However, Bitcoin.com has since corrected their mistake, adding the “Cash” part to BCH, while still naming BTC as ""Bitcoin Core"". Twitter user MoneyTrigz, who originally launched the idea of the lawsuit, tweeted, “We appreciate the 31 people that donated to the initiative. But USD 3,700 won't be enough to do much, so we decided to cancel the initiative and refund the 31 transactions (total 0.39BTC). I’m happy were able to at least get bitcoin.com make 90% changes on its fraud and disinformation.” Charlie Lee, founder of Litecoin cryptocurrency, called the lawsuit “stupid” at first, but retracted his statement in a tweet, saying that the lawsuit has obviously “done some good” by making Roger Ver, the creator of bitcoin.com, correct the erroneous claims made on his website. The group’s response to the decision to pull the lawsuit has been largely positive, with one user saying it was “the first time Roger [Ver] scaled back on his fraudulent practices.” The civil war between BTC and BCH will presumably keep raging, although it often boils down to fans of both picking petty fights. However, this move should not be seen as a loss for BCH: if anything, it is a help to crypto rookies to not make mistakes because of Bitcoin confusion. As a certain videogame would say, “War. War never changes.”"
1," Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies traded higher during the past few sessions and registered solid gains. BTC/USD cleared a major resistance at USD 9,500 to move further in the bullish zone. Similarly, Ethereum cleared the USD 780 - USD 800 barrier to register more than 10% gains. Overall, the current technical structure is bullish, which could result in more upsides in bitcoin and altcoins. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is rising steadily and is up around 6.4% to USD 9,820 (~GMT 9:00 AM). BTC/USD settled above a major resistance at USD 9,500, opening the doors for a test of USD 10,000. Should buyers succeed in clearing the USD 10,000 hurdle, the price could accelerate gains in the near term. The next resistance is close to the USD 10,800 level.
If there is a correction from the current or higher levels, the previous resistance at USD 9,500 is likely to act as a support. Below the stated USD 9,500, the next major support is at USD 9,200. Ethereum
Ethereum gained more than 10% today and is currently flirting with the USD 800 resistance. A successful close above the stated resistance may perhaps call for further upsides towards the USD 840 level.
On the downside, there are many support for ETH/USD, starting with USD 780 and up to USD 750. The pair remains well supported on dips and it seems like buyers are in control above USD 780. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is struggling to catch up and is currently up around 2.8% to USD 1,520. BCH/USD broke the USD 1,500 resistance, which is a positive sign. However, the price has to gain momentum to continue towards USD 1,540. On the downside, the USD 1,500 and USD 1,480 are support levels.
Ripple traded higher and broke the USD 0.90 resistance. XRP/USD is now back in a bullish zone and it could continue to rise towards the USD 1.00 level during the following sessions. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins traded higher today, including Loom, Decred, ETN, Nano, KCS, Komodo and Augur.  The current market sentiment is bullish for bitcoin and altcoins. If BTC succeeds in clearing the USD 10,000 hurdle today, there could be heavy gains in the crypto market."
1," Following a bull breakout last night, bitcoin (BTC) looks set to test $10,000 and could possibly move higher over the weekend. Bitcoin closed yesterday (as per UTC) at $9,759 on Bitfinex – the highest daily close since March 7 – signaling the upside break of the week-long narrowing price range we’ve been anticipating. The cryptocurrency also clocked a two-month high of $9,875 yesterday. At time of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,776 and remains on the hunt for a big break above the $10,000 mark, as indicated by the bullish setup in the technical charts below.  The chart above shows a pennant breakout (bullish continuation pattern), indicating that the rally from April lows below $6,500 has resumed. The move has opened the doors for a rise to $10,455–$11,950 (target calculated using two variations of the measured height method). However, the 4-hour relative strength index (RSI) is close to moving above 70.00, signaling overbought conditions. As a result, a rally to $11,950 looks to be a tough task to achieve and $10,455 may be more realistic.  The ascending, bullish 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA also favor further upside in prices. Meanwhile, the RSI is stationed at 62 – well below 70 (overbought territory), leaving enough room for a rally to $10,400–$10,500. And, last but not the least, BTC’s bullish breakout yesterday was backed by a 35 percent rise in trading volumes, according to CoinMarketCap. A high volume breakout only validates the argument that the rally has legs. Darts board image via Shutterstock"
1," Cai Wensheng, an angel investor from China and chairman of photo retouching app provider Meitu, says he has achieved his goal of accruing 10,000 bitcoins. In an open group Q&A session with tech entrepreneur Wang Feng on WeChat on Thursday, Cai disclosed that although he was holding a single bitcoin in January of this year, he moved to increase his portfolio over the first quarter of 2018 amid the bearish market’s lower prices. Soon after December’s record high round $20,000, the price of bitcoin started dropping in January. It reached a low for the year so far below $6,000 in February, before climbing again to over $9,700 at press time. According to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, Cai’s holdings are now worth around $96 million. Cai explained his reasoning for the investment during the Q&A, saying: “I only had single digit unit of bitcoin, just for fun in January. But when I got certain that bitcoin and blockchain is the future, I set the goal of holding 10,000 bitcoin. So I started around end of January to build my [holdings] following the price decline. The more it dropped, the more I bought in and now the mission is basically complete.” Born in the 1970s, Cai made his name and first fortune by investing in domain names during the internet bubble and expanded his investment portfolio over the next decade as an angel investor. His current venture, Meitu, a popular photo retouching tool in China that claims to have over 90 million monthly active users, went public in Hong Kong in December 2016 with a valuation of $5 billion at the time. Cai’s disclosure makes him one of the few big-name investors in China to have openly disclosed their bitcoin holdings. It also comes at a time when Meitu is aiming to utilize blockchain technology to decentralize storage of users’ data, according to a white paper published in January. Cai Wensheng image via Meitu"
1," Two months ago, Reddit dropped Bitcoin (BTC) as a method of payment. This was due to the increase in transaction fees. Now, however, it appears bitcoin may be returning to the platform. This isn’t speculation, either; the Reddit chief technology officer confirmed the news of bitcoin payments returning to Reddit.  On Thursday, Chris Slowe, Reddit’s CTO, announced in an interview that the site is planning to reinstate bitcoin as a form of payment. This option will be available to the platform’s gold members. There’s more, though. Slowe went on to say that Reddit is not just looking solely at BTC, but rather it is looking at adding more than one crypto payment option.  The other coins Reddit is looking at are Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC). Ethereum (ETH) is currently selling for $746.09, putting the coin up 9.71% in the past twenty-four hours.  Source: CoinMarketCap Meanwhile, Litecoin is also in the green, currently selling for $160.42. This puts the coin up 7.82% in the past twenty-four hours.   Source: CoinMarketCap Aside from a spike in transaction fees, Reddit has also cited the reason for the site stopping the bitcoin option to be because of its integration issue with Coinbase (Reddit’s crypto payments processor). Back in March, Coinbase turned off its Merchant Tool and replaced it with a Coinbase Commerce product. This is reportedly one of the reasons that ultimately led to the halt. The news is circulating around the Twitter universe, which suggests people are excited about bitcoin’s return. One crypto analyst even tweeted that this is an indication that the cryptovirus is spreading, writing “internet money for the win.” Others questioned the point, stating that we don’t know whether or not the fees will rise again (like they did in December) once people start using bitcoin heavily again. In response to the latter point, people reminded the user that Segwit was not implemented in December in the way that it is now. >>Goldman Sachs Launching Bitcoin Futures Contracts Soon What do you think of the news? Are you glad to see bitcoin payments returning to Reddit? Featured Image: Twitter"
1," Financial services company Goldman Sachs has announced its intent to launch Bitcoin futures contracts in the near future. Goldman Sachs launching Bitcoin futures contracts is a pretty big deal for the financial world. What made the investment firm take the plunge? New York Times reporter Nathaniel Popper wrote that Goldman Sachs plans to use its own money to trade Bitcoin futures contracts for its clients. The investment firm will also offer its clients its very own bitcoin futures products. “[Goldman Sachs] will also create its own, more flexible version of a future, known as a non-deliverable forward, which it will offer to clients,” continued Popper. An exact date has yet to be set, but Goldman Sachs said it will likely be occurring within the next few weeks. >> Bitcoin Hashrate Nears All-Time High Despite Market Skepticism Goldman Sachs isn’t the first big gun to launch a Bitcoin futures service. Back in December, Cboe Global Markets and CME Group both launched Bitcoin futures trading, on December 10th and December 17th respectively. Although both launches were a resounding success, the Bitcoin futures trading may have also, in part, led to the subsequent Bitcoin crash shortly after. Bitcoin has yet to fully recover from its crash, the coin now selling at $9,416.12 according to CoinMarketCap data (which is approximately $10,000 below its all-time high selling price achieved on December 17th). So why does Goldman Sachs want to get in on the Bitcoin futures action? One of the Goldman executives in charge of creating the futures operation, Rana Yared, told New York Times that “the bank had received inquiries from hedge funds, as well as endowments and foundations that received virtual currency donations from newly minted bitcoin millionaires and didn’t know how to handle them.” Yared continued, “It resonates with us when a client says, ‘I want to hold bitcoin or bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate store of value.'” Evidently, there were quite a few clients who felt this and so, ultimately, the decision to start Bitcoin futures contracts was approved by the Goldman board of directors. What effect do you think Goldman Sachs launching Bitcoin futures contracts will have on the market? Will it help to move Bitcoin’s price up? Or do you think another crash will happen? >> Why You Should be Aware of Cryptocurrency Market Fluctuations Featured image: Fortune"
1," A Wednesday panel at the Milken Institute Global Conference was billed as a sober discussion to a ballroom where every seat was filled, but soon turned to shouting, crosstalk and what seems like the perfect opportunity to see it as a superhero vs supervillain fight a la Marvel. Nouriel Roubini is the famously bearish New York University economist, who predicted the 2008 financial crisis which earned him the nickname Dr Doom. He called Bitcoin fanatics as “suckers” and said repeatedly that its underlying technology was “bulls**t,” Bloomberg reported. In his opinion, the blockchain is a “glorified Excel spreadsheet” since “cryptocurrency holders still go through centralized exchanges to clear their transactions.” Alex Mashinsky, a blockchain entrepreneur, told him, “Everything you just said is irrelevant.” Voicing the general confusion, Bill Barhydt, who worked on cryptography for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) said, “I don’t even know where to begin.” Mashinsky stepped up to the Captain Crypto role to defend the valiant cryptoverse, saying crypto assets will let people bypass banks, to which Dr Doom replied, “You’re just making stuff up.” It would seem Dr Doom was not informed that sticking your fingers in your ears and shouting lalala does not change reality when you’re above six years old. Mashinsky wasn’t backing down. “Why don’t you buy one coin, then you can tell us how it works,” he slammed the “evil” Dr Doom down. According to New York Post, Barhydt said of Roubini that this is, “like a horse salesman saying we don’t need combustion engines.” Although many in the crypto space may seem younglings compared to all panelists, we feel compelled to tell you: this is not how grownups talk. Or they do?"
1," Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs is moving ahead with plans to set up the first Bitcoin trading operation at a Wall Street bank, The New York Times reported. While the exact launch date of the new trading operation is not yet set, the move came after the bank's board of directors signed off on the initiative. Although Goldman will not immediately be buying and selling Bitcoin, a team at the bank is reported to be willing to go into that direction following regulatory approval, as well as having a plan on how to deal with the associated risks. One of the Goldman executives overseeing the creation of the trading operation, Rana Yared, said the decision resulted from a growing number of inquiries from clients who expressed their interest in holding (or HODLing) Bitcoin. “It resonates with us when a client says, ‘I want to hold Bitcoin or Bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate store of value,’” she told the Times. She adds that Goldman had concluded that Bitcoin is not a fraud and does not have the characteristics of a currency. They also intend on creating their own future, described as more flexible, known as a non-deliverable forward, which they will offer to clients. They have also hired their own first “digital asset” trader, Justin Schmidt, to handle the daily operation. Schmidt previously worked as a trader at hedge fund Seven Eight Capital before leaving last year to trade cryptocurrencies. Futures contracts, also referred to as futures, are standardized exchange-traded financial derivatives that provide an agreement between a buyer and a seller to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a predefined date. Each futures contract represents a specific amount of the underlying asset and futures can be either cash settled or come with physical delivery. In the case of bitcoin futures, the underlying asset is the digital currency bitcoin.

1," The crypto market has recovered slowly and steady during the past five weeks. Bitcoin price broke the USD 8,000 and USD 8,500 resistance levels to settle above USD 9,000. However, volatility dipped sharply during the past few months. Per Bloomberg, Bitcoin’s daily trading range fell from USD 4,700 in December 2017 to USD 124 in April 2018. Such narrow ranges were seen during mid-2017 before BTC/USD jumped from USD 2,000 towards USD 20,000. The current technical structure, narrow range trading, candlestick patterns on the daily chart and multiple rejection patterns from the lows indicates that bitcoin price is heading towards a major break. It could surge higher if buyers succeed in pushing the price above the USD 10,000 resistance level. Therefore, the next few weeks may perhaps play a crucial role. Bitcoin
Considering intraday price action, bitcoin price was successful in surpassing the USD 9,250 resistance. It has opened the doors for more gains, which means BTC/USD could accelerate higher towards USD 9,500 and USD 9,600 during the following sessions.
On the downside, supports are seen at USD 9,100, USD 9,050 and USD 9,000. Any further declines could be limited considering the current positive bias. Ethereum
Ethereum once again performed well and broke the USD 700 resistance. ETH/USD traded to a new monthly high above USD 730, and it seems like the pair is likely to continue its upside move.
If there is a downside correction, the broken resistance levels at USD 700 and USD 690 are likely to act as supports in the near term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash broke a crucial resistance at USD 1,400, which opened the doors for a push above USD 1,500. BCH/USD traded as high as USD 1,540 today before correcting to USD 1,480. On the downside, supports are at USD 1,450 and USD 1,400.
Ripple is trading flat near the USD 0.85 level. XRP/USD is facing a lot of hurdles on the upside, and it is struggling to move above the USD 0.90 resistance zone. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, two small cap altcoins, Golem and Hshare registered heavy gains. Both are trading higher by more than 40% to USD 0.80 and 16 respectively. GNT price is showing a bullish formation and it could test the USD 1.00 resistance. A few other coins, such as Bytecoin, Fusion, Loom Network, VERI and 0x registered around 20% gains. Overall, the current market sentiment is bullish, which could lead to more upsides in bitcoin and altcoins."
1," Bitcoin is famous (or infamous) for its daily price jumps and falls, but lately the charts seem to be bordering on the comatose. So, has the cryptocurrency’s volatility really dropped or are we in business as usual? We crunched the numbers to find out, and while things have been calm of late, it certainly hasn’t been a quiet 2018 for the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency. In fact, bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed daily volatility (or an inter-day trading range) above $1,000 as many as 43 times so far this year (using price data from CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index). That would seem a lot perhaps, but it’s not so simple. When we break down the data over time another pattern reveals itself. if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""t9zpR""]={},window.datawrapper[""t9zpR""].embedDeltas={""100"":581.0208339999999,""200"":527.0208339999999,""300"":527.0208339999999,""400"":501.020834,""500"":501.020834,""700"":501.020834,""800"":501.020834,""900"":501.020834,""1000"":501.020834},window.datawrapper[""t9zpR""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-t9zpR""),window.datawrapper[""t9zpR""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""t9zpR""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""t9zpR""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""t9zpR""==b)window.datawrapper[""t9zpR""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""}); The number of days in 2018 when the trading range was above $1,000 was highest in January, passing that level 21 times. Notably, that month saw the crypto markets rocked by regulatory talk in South Korea and China that caused jitters among traders and investors. Moving on, the number of days the trading range was above $1,000 in February dropped by nearly half to 13. Since then volatility has indeed plummeted, dropping to seven days in March and just two days in April. It’s worth noting that bitcoin’s price starting falling sharply from near record highs at the start of January amid the market angst over the Asian news. Since volatility tends to spike during bear markets and drop during bullish price action, this pattern is something that could have been expected. So, as the bearish atmosphere prevailed early in the year, the frequency of trading ranges above $1,000 was at its highest, while the subsequent bullish shift in the market has had the opposite effect. For example, BTC rallied from $6,443 to $9,536 over the last 32 days. Meanwhile, during the same time period, the average daily volatility dropped to $454. Further, the daily volatility stood at $278 yesterday – down almost 70 percent from the average daily volatility of $922 seen this year and below the 2017 average of $348 (predominantly a bull market). An extended period of low volatility is often followed by a sharp rise in volatility (big move). The mean reversion theory also states that readings (volumes, price, returns) eventually move back toward the means (averages). So, it looks safe to say the business is about to pick up. Right now, the technical set up on the charts is bullish, so the big move, when it happens, will likely happen on the higher side. But, as always, there are no guarantees… Yo-yo image via Shutterstock"
1," Sell in May and go away? While the month may traditionally give equity bulls cold feet, it should probably not be a cause of worry for the bitcoin market. Indeed, it’s true the month of May is often a weak period for equities, and that bitcoin has acted as a risk asset (moving in tandem with equities) since February. As such, cryptocurrency investors may fear that a potential drop in equities could end up dragging bitcoin prices lower. However, historical data suggests that bitcoin is more likely to build upon its April rally this month. Notably, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has scored gains in the month of May in five out of the last seven years, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""XLfQQ""]={},window.datawrapper[""XLfQQ""].embedDeltas={""100"":453.020834,""200"":426.020834,""300"":400.020834,""400"":400.020834,""500"":400.020834,""700"":400.020834,""800"":400.020834,""900"":400.020834,""1000"":400.020834},window.datawrapper[""XLfQQ""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-XLfQQ""),window.datawrapper[""XLfQQ""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""XLfQQ""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""XLfQQ""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""XLfQQ""==b)window.datawrapper[""XLfQQ""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""}); According to the data: Furthermore, BTC has fared well in every second quarter since its creation – the highest being 1,964 percent in Q2 2011, when bitcoin jumped from $0.78 to $16.10. Clearly, history is on the bulls’ side. Further, the seasonality analysis only adds credence to the bullish set up as seen in the bitcoin chart below.  As discussed yesterday, the observed bull pennant breakout could see the recent rally from the April low of $6,425 (Bitfinex price) extend to $10,000 or even higher. The cryptocurrency has been restricted to a narrowing price range for more than a week and has spent a better part of the last 12 hours trading between $9,150 and $9,300. As the technical theory has it, the longer the duration of the consolidation zone, the more violent the breakout tends to be. So, BTC could move well above the $10,000 mark in an hour or two post-breakout, if the bulls gain the upper hand. BTC tends to perform well in May, thus an upside breakout of the narrowing price range is more likely and could yield a quick move higher to $10,000. On the other hand, a downside break would open the doors to $8,490 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $6,425 to $9,767.4). Only a daily close (as per UTC) below $7,823 (April 17 low) would signal a bear revival. Chalk arrow image via Shutterstock"
1," A straightforward data point – the total supply of bitcoin hit 17 million. But as with most things in crypto, it wasn’t so simple. Every 10 minutes or so, miners find a block of transactions and the network adds 12.5 new bitcoin to the total supply as a reward for the finders. And each reward has been logged on the blockchain since bitcoin launched in early 2009. As such, it seemed like a number – a milestone – the industry could trust. But as some celebrated once the mark was hit on bitcoin data provider Blockchain’s website, others took to Twitter to rain on their parade. Jameson Lopp, Casa engineer and the creator of Statoshi.info, another public-facing bitcoin data site, tweeted: “Today I’ve learned that a lot of data sources are incorrectly reporting the total bitcoin supply. We haven’t actually hit 17 million BTC yet.” Lopp’s contention was that Blockchain.info, one of the most popular and highly-regarded sources for blockchain network data, among others, had not accounted for instances in which bitcoin miners, due to bugs and other causes, did not claim their full block reward. Unfortunately, these discrepancies in the total bitcoin supply metric are not the exception, but part of a larger problem that stems from the “opaque” methodologies these blockchain data analysis providers use, according to Greg Cipolaro, the CEO of Digital Asset Research (DAR), a firm that provides blockchain analysis to clients. As such, DAR went on a mission to figure out Blockchain’s methods for what it calls “one of the longest standing mysteries in the cryptocurrency community” – bitcoin’s estimated transaction value. In the company’s report on the subject, published recently, DAR said Blockchain over-estimated transaction values from October to February 2017 and has mostly underestimated them since then. Executives from Blockchain were not available for interview before press time. But it’s not only Blockchain. Cipolaro cited CoinMarketCap’s January removal (without warning) of South Korean exchange data from its price index. Since cryptocurrency prices on South Korean exchanges have tended to be higher, the eviction made it appear that the crypto markets were crashing. Panic selling ensued, setting off what Cipolaro called “a mini-flash crash.” In fairness, though, price indices always involve subjective decisions. That is true not only of cryptocurrencies but also the stock market. Yet without insight into how price and other metrics are arrived at, the cryptocurrency community could suffer. Accurate data is extremely important for investors, traders, users, developers, academics, journalists – basically everyone. Still, many people who depend on public blockchain data don’t realize how flawed some of this data is. Offering a grim outlook on the broad state of blockchain analysis today, Stefan Richter, a computer scientist who co-founded data provider BitcoinPrivacy, told CoinDesk: “There are, of course, software bugs in probably every explorer around.” And Cipolaro echoed that, saying, “This is not something you would notice unless you spent your days looking at it.” Luckily, some industry enthusiasts have noticed. Lopp, for one, is a cryptocurrency data hound. He pointed to bitcoin node count, a figure often cited as a measure of the network’s decentralization and health, as a particularly finicky metric. “I often hear folks say that there are only 10,000 bitcoin nodes,” Lopp said. But the source of that figure, Bitnodes, “only counts reachable nodes that accept incoming connections.” Addy Yeow, the creator of Bitnodes, confirmed that the site only counts “listening” nodes. As such, the total number of nodes could be far higher, according to both Lopp. Indeed, one estimate puts listening and non-listening nodes at nearly 140,000. And while Yeow agrees, he cautions that adding non-listening nodes to the metric would require making major assumptions. He explained that data sources that count non-listening nodes are actually taking part in a guessing game. Nodes that aren’t listening could still be connected, but behind a firewall, for example. Alternatively, they could have changed IP addresses, or the could have disconnected entirely. The analysis providers that take into account non-listening nodes use a formula which takes into account the number of days nodes have been non-listening in an effort to count them, but the more unseen-but-connected nodes they capture, the more disconnected nodes they erroneously include. Due to the issues with public data sets, many blockchain data professionals avoid using them and instead use data they calculate internally whenever possible. Chainalysis, a firm that analyzes blockchain data for clients including the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), is certainly skeptical. Kimberley Grauer, Chainalysis’ chief economist, said she prefers to use internal data because, “I know where the errors are; I know where the vulnerabilities are.” DAR’s Cipolaro echoed that, telling CoinDesk the company runs its own code, gleaning data from its own bitcoin node. Still, despite their shortcomings, Cipolaro has high praise for the free sites that make bitcoin data available to the public. “They provide a good source of high-quality information,” he said. And it’s obvious these companies are trying. When a bug in Blockchain’s web service made it appear (incorrectly) that bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto had moved some coins, the company fixed the problem. Certain issues should be easy to fix. Grauer pointed out that block explorers often neglect to note time zones, and they don’t all use the same one. While that’s not strictly wrong, it causes confusion. “Just compare blockchain.info to btc.com!” Grauer said. (We did: block 520672 was either mined at 23:18 on April 30 or 03:18 on May 1. There’s no hint of what time zone either site is using.) Other data sets won’t be as easy to clean up. While the bitcoin blockchain may be fully public for all to see, the complicated way in which transactions are performed means measuring their value can be quite the challenge. Even DAR does not claim its new method is perfectly accurate. “This will not likely be the last improvement we make,” the company said in its report. For the time being, the community will need to remember the old Russian proverb, repurposed by cypherpunks: “Don’t trust, verify.” Bingo image via Shutterstock"
1," Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs will use its own money to trade bitcoin futures on behalf of its clients, according to the New York Times. The Times  reported Wednesday that while the exact launch date of the new trading operation is not yet set, the move came after the bank’s board of directors signed off on the initiative. Goldman is also set to “create its own, more flexible version of a future, known as a non-deliverable forward, which it will offer to clients,” according to the report. Goldman executive Rana Yared said the decision resulted from a growing number of inquiries from clients that indicated interest in holding bitcoin as an alternative asset. “It resonates with us when a client says, ‘I want to hold bitcoin or bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate store of value,’” she told the Times. The investment bank has hired its first “digital asset” trader, Justin Schmidt, to handle the daily operation. Schmidt previously worked as a trader at hedge fund Seven Eight Capital before leaving last year to trade cryptocurrencies. The news reflects the growing involvement of Goldman in the crypto-market, as CEO Lloyd Blankfein has previously said that the investment bank was clearing bitcoin futures for its clients. Per the Times, any deeper action – including the direct handling of bitcoin – will only come following approval from U.S. regulators. And according to Yared, Goldman officials have taken a cautious approach throughout the process. “For almost every person involved, there has been personal skepticism brought to the table,” Yared was quoted as saying, adding: “It is not a new risk that we don’t understand. It is just a heightened risk that we need to be extra aware of here.” Goldman Sachs logo image via Shutterstock"
1," The Bitcoin hashrate is nearing its all-time high, despite market skepticism over Bitcoin’s popularity. The Bitcoin hashrate was at 31.6615 hash per second as of May 1st, 2018, according to data from BitInfoCharts."
1," There was a strong recovery in bitcoin, ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin price moved back above USD 9,000 and ETH/USD bounced back sharply to trade close USD 680. The technical structure suggests that BTC and ETH are likely to surge higher and trade to fresh monthly highs during the coming sessions. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price recovered and traded above the USD 9,000 pivot level. BTC/USD is currently trading 0.5% up to USD 9,090 and it seems like the price may accelerate higher. 
On the upside, there are two important resistances – USD 9,200 and USD 9,250. A close above the USD 9,250 resistance could open the doors for a push towards the USD 9,500 level in the near term.
If there is a downside correction, the price may find bids near USD 9,000, followed by the USD 8,800 swing low. Ethereum
Ethereum performed really well and recovered above the USD 650 and USD 670 resistance levels. More importantly, the ETH/USD pair formed a solid bullish pattern on the daily chart, signaling a rejection from the USD 625 level.
On the upside, the price is facing resistance near USD 680. Should the price clear the stated USD 780, it could accelerate above the USD 700 level.  Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is up around 2.1% to USD 1,352. BCH/USD is showing positive signs above the USD 1,320 support, but it has to break the USD 1,380 and USD 1,400 resistance levels to remain in a positive zone. A proper close above USD 1,400 may perhaps push the price towards USD 1,500.
Ripple moved up by more than 2.5% and broke the USD 0.85 resistance. It seems like the XRP/USD pair continue to move higher towards the next hurdle at USD 0.90 in the near term. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, Loom Network surged by more than 40% and traded above USD 0.40. A major cryptocurrency exchange, Binance listed LOOM, which ignited a rally.  Moreover, there were many small cap coins, which registered more than 10% gains today, such as ReddCoin, Stratis, BAT, Syscoin, Fusion and NXT. The overall market sentiment is back in the green zone, signaling more upsides in bitcoin and altcoins."
1," Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a narrowing price range over the past week, but a bullish breakout is looking likely, the technical charts suggest. The cryptocurrency created a bearish outside-day candle last Wednesday, signaling the rally from the low of $6,425 had run out of steam. However, the bitcoin bulls ensured there was no negative follow-through on Thursday and defended $8,800 over the weekend. While a convincing break above $9,500 has remained elusive so far, the charts suggest the bulls have the stronger hand going forward.  The chart above shows that bitcoin is trading in a narrowing price range with higher lows and lower highs, forming a bull pennant pattern. A bullish breakout would mean the rally from the low of $6,425 has resumed and could open the doors to $12,000 (target as per the measured height method – i.e. length of the flagpole added to breakout price). While that target looks a little far-fetched, BTC could rally to $10,000 on confirmation of a bull-pennant breakout (4-hour close above pennant resistance of $9,400). On the other hand,  a downside break would add credence to last Wednesday’s bearish outside-day candle and could yield a pullback to $8,490 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $6,425 to $9,767.4). That said, the odds of a bull-pennant breakout are high as indicated by the price action in the daily chart below.  The bears failed to capitalize on bullish exhaustion last week, as indicated by the bearish outside-day candle. This is evident from the lack of bearish follow-through on Thursday and higher lows pattern – $8,652 (April 26 low), $8,750 (April 28 low) and $8,818 (May 1 low). Further, the gradually ascending 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA continue to favor the bulls. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,120 on Bitfinex, representing marginal gains compared to the previous day’s close (as per UTC) of $9,066. Bitcoin image via Shutterstock"
1," “I’d rather short ether.” Andrew Left, the activist short-seller behind Citron Research, told CoinDesk on Tuesday that he thinks both bitcoin and ether, the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network, are “bubbles.” If he had to choose one, though, he’d bet on ether’s price to fall. Left is known for writing explosive reports into companies like the Canadian pharmaceutical firm Valeant, arguing that investors should short them. His comments came a day after he fired a Twitter broadside at Square, a payments company that has been adding support for bitcoin buying and selling. He declared that the company’s share price is likely to drop to $30, from just under $49 prior to the tweet. “WallSt drunk on Bitcoin nonsense, SQ-Cash to BTC trading has been insignificant,” Left wrote. Square is scheduled to report its latest earnings data on Wednesday, and if “they’ve earned nothing from crypto, don’t be surprised,” Left told CoinDesk. Left has taken aim at other investments related to cryptocurrency in the past, but he told CoinDesk that each had an “individual reason.” Addressing bitcoin’s merits in and of itself, he acknowledged the appeal of a decentralized asset or a kind of digital gold, commenting: “I dig it.” He’s not so sure that bitcoin will win out, he said, but as mentioned before, he would gladly short the second-largest cryptocurrency by value. Left dismissed a bullish argument for ether – that its price will grow because entrepreneurs can issue tokens and build decentralized applications on top of the ethereum blockchain – using the analogy that Oracle doesn’t own part of the businesses that run on its own servers. In his view, ether bulls use a “circular argument” – that is, “it’ll go up because it’ll go up.” “I think both are bubbles,” he said of bitcoin and ether, but “if I were going to be wrong about one of these, it would be bitcoin.” Left has been shorting stocks full-time since 2001, and has said he’s made money every year. Short sellers profit when the price of a stock (or another asset) falls; they accomplish this by borrowing shares, selling them, and buying them back later to return to the original owner. The Citron founder is most famous for correctly predicting the fall in shares of Valeant, a Canadian pharmaceutical company that has been at the center of an accounting scandal.

0," 16,000 Bitcoin – totaling just over $140 million – was sold by Nobuaki Kobayashi, a Mt. Gox Trustee, in a move that took an increasingly optimistic Bitcoin community by surprise. The move triggered some nervousness because a previous similar course of actions by the man known as “The Tokyo Bitcoin Whale” (the selling of 400M$ in BTC) was pointed as the cause of a bearish streak that ended with a fall in BTC prices of almost 40%. With similar precedent, negative opinions did not take long, including several media outlets rushing to sell the news, publishing a negative sentiments shared by some technical analysts. The correlation seemed obvious, so the results were to be expected. However, it is important to note that Mr. Nobuaki had previously talked about the situation, clearing up the doubts of many investors who practically blamed him for a global collapse: “Following consultation with cryptocurrency experts, I sold BTC and BCH, not by an ordinary sale through the BTC/BCH exchange, but in a manner that would avoid affecting the market price, while ensuring the security of the transaction to the extent possible,” Despite the series of massive sales that took place, the Bitcoin market remained stable, with a steady and relatively bullish trend holding it at around $9,000. Nervousness and volatility could not reverse market sentiment, which this time did not buy the news.  The reason seems to be the same one previously overlooked by analysts. Apparently, Mr. Nobuaki’s sales were made OTC, i.e., they are not reflected in the charts as they are made in batches and in a personal way, and not through intermediaries as is usual in traditional trading exercises. Trading over the counter is a less popular form of trading in which no trading records are produced. The parties personally buy, negotiate and sell crypto to avoid regulations, price deviations and any other type of alterations and barriers typical of traditional trade. Kevin Zhou, the founder of cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund Galois Capital, told Reuters that this is the ideal way to carry out large-scale operations like Mr. Nobuaki’s: “Generally, you would go trade through an OTC desk when you have a large block trade you want to do without moving the market too much or incurring too much slippage” This strategy is logical. In theory, Mr. Nobuaki could sell all his tokens at a certain price immediately without going through the “market sell” processes that would exhaust the buy orders causing a considerable drop in Bitcoin prices. The market remains calm; apparently, the period of nervousness has passed, and the bullish are gaining ground, especially in candles reflecting behaviors over the one day span, which leads to the conclusion that there is strong confidence in the behavior of BTC prices. This optimism seems to extend to the rest of the important altcoins that are having a positive correction Featured Image: Facebook"
0," Warren Buffett has never shown himself to be a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Buffett still isn’t jumping on the crypto train. Buffett told Yahoo Finance that he doesn’t see Bitcoin as an investment. Instead, he believes it’s a gamble. He continued to explain that there isn’t anything wrong with that, per say, but that it’s important not to treat Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as anything more than a game. You can’t expect it to behave like an investment, because it isn’t an investment. Buffett explained: “If you buy something like a farm, an apartment house, or an interest in a business… You can do that on a private basis… And it’s a perfectly satisfactory investment. You look at the investment itself to deliver the return to you. Now, if you buy something like bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don’t really have anything that has produced anything. You’re just hoping the next guy pays more.” He continued to explain that “You aren’t investing when you do that. You’re speculating. There’s nothing wrong with it. If you wanna gamble somebody else will come along and pay more money tomorrow, that’s one kind of game. That is not investing.” Buffett’s stance on Bitcoin shouldn’t come as a huge surprise given his previous thoughts on the coin. >> Fundstrat Poll Shows Investors Believe in Bitcoin In 2014, Buffett likened Bitcoin to that of a mirage. He also compared Bitcoin to cheques: they’re both just ways of transmitting money. At the time he said that Bitcoin shouldn’t hold value because there were a number of ways money could be transmitted. Despite the advancements in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through the years, Buffett has little changed his tune. In January of this year, Buffett told CNBC that cryptocurrencies “will come to a bad ending.” Buffett is a crypto bear that never plans on buying Bitcoin. Do you agree with Warren Buffett on Bitcoin?

0," The Bitcoin (BTC)-supporting community from the everlasting war between BTC and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is furious because they claim that sites like bitcoin.com are misleading buyers into purchasing BCH instead of Bitcoin. The problem lies in the site using the name Bitcoin for BCH and Bitcoin Core for BTC. The outraged users have now launched a site, bitcoincomlawsuit.info, which will soon be accepting Bitcoin donations in support of leveling a promised lawsuit against Bitcoin.com. Blurring the distinction between BCH and BTC has caused people to purchase BCH instead of BTC like they wanted, users claim, calling this a “fraud” and naming that as the basis for the lawsuit. Notably, the creator of bitcoin.com is Roger Ver, a long-standing proponent of Bitcoin Cash, who is well-known and often controversial for his stance that Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin. As previously written in our short primer on this war, some skeptics see this battle as a harbinger of the 'crash' that everyone who has not bought into crypto yet is waiting for. This war, shortly summarized as Roger Ver against the world, is nothing new: a while ago, he offered social media site Reddit USD 100,000 if they appoint a new moderator to the popular subreddit r/Bitcoin “who supports free speech.” But as a user pointed out, “Speech isn’t free if you pay USD 100,000 for it.” His antics have even forced Erik Voorhees, CEO of ShapeShift, a digital assets trading company, to come forward with his opinion on this feud, tweeting: Roger - please stop referencing me to back up your opinion that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. It isn't. Bitcoin is the chain originating from the genesis block with the highest accumulated proof of work. The Bitcoin Cash fork failed to gain majority, thus it is not Bitcoin."
0," Several analysts have predicted widespread cryptocurrency market volatility after Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee of defunct exchange Mt. Gox, moved BTC 16,000 (USD 147m) and a similar amount in Bitcoin Cash to an unknown address. Should Mt. Gox trustees move to sell more of the company’s huge cryptocurrency holdings, markets everywhere could be in for a tumultuous end to the week. Last time Mt. Gox sold some USD 400-500 million in Bitcoin, to cover the exchange’s yen debts, trustees were criticized as markets in multiple currencies nosedived. News outlet The Next Web quotes cryptocurrency analyst Ivo Jonkers as saying, “It appears that the Mt. Gox trustees have moved the funds to a wallet belonging to an exchange desk. The last time this happened, Mt. Gox proceeded to sell the funds at market rate, practically sending the entire market in the red. I wouldn't be surprised if this happens again.” South Korean media outlet Blockinpress claims it is “highly likely that [Kobayashi] will seek to sell the currency through exchanges with over-the-counter (OTC) transactions.” A court ruling that would appear to preventing the further sale of Mt. Gox’s crypto assets until September this year is in place, but it is unclear as to whether this would actually prevent Kobayashi from making a sale. Kobayashi claimed in March that the trustee’s previous asset sales have been measured, saying, “Following consultation with cryptocurrency experts, I sold BTC and Bitcoin Cash, not in an ordinary sale through a BTC or BCH exchange, but in a manner that would avoid affecting the market price, while ensuring the security of the transaction to the [greatest possible extent].”"
1," As with any new technology and trend, there will always be prognosticators who want to explain to the masses what is going to happen in the future. This is even true of the economists and the pollsters. One has to take all of these with a seriously large grain of salt and healthy suspicion as the predictions are only just that and not necessarily reality. I only need to point you to the 2016 US presidential elections to show you how wrong the pollster prophets were. They still seemed to not have recovered from their bad polling.  So with Bitcoin, we will look at some of the price predictions and other predictions that may or may not be accurate. Part of the issue is that this technology is still on the low side of the bell curve of global acceptance. So basically, the herd has not caught onto it just yet.  Just to put a little perspective on this short article, it is going on the last full week of April 2018 at the time of this report. Looking at CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is priced at $8,879. Keep that in mind as we look at a few predictions for 2018 regarding Bitcoin.  Standpoint Research under Ronnie Moas has predicted Bitcoin to be at $20,000 per coin by the end of November 2018. This is doable, based on the understanding that the stock market is overpriced and the USD is devaluing globally. Of course, the tax cuts in the United States opening up growth in the American economy may not have been a factor that was considered, which could slow down the devaluing of the USD.  Mike Novogratz is calling for Bitcoin to reach $40,000 by the end of 2018. Mike is a serious investor in this space and has been investing in ICO. So his insight is valuable. It is based on a strong belief that institutional investors are poised to invest heavily in Bitcoin. This will pour a lot of needed capital into this technology and will be the vehicle to bring the price per bitcoin up substantially.  McAfee has predicted the wildest and craziest at $1 Million by the end of 2020. Maybe he was talking about Bitcoin Cash, we are not sure. Either way, that is quite a prediction and would be very cool if that happens.  As far as the number of holders of Cryptocurrencies, that number has been predicted to go up to approximately 50 million investors by the end of 2018. This is a global prediction by Yonatan Sela of Props. This would be the beginning of the wave of herd investors as this digital currency gains momentum.  The ability for the marketplace to see Bitcoin as a means of commerce rather than just a place to acquire an asset seems to be taking hold in 2018. It is not widespread that businesses will accept Bitcoin for example as a means of payment, but the prediction in 2018 is that it is trending. One of the craziest predictions we saw for 2018 is that Bitcoin will have increased use among online gambling to the point of even having short-term volatility insurance. So these are just a few of the wild predictions around Bitcoin for 2018. It is not just about price, it is about the number of investors going up, and the trend to have Bitcoin as the means of payment for more and more services, including gambling.  This is just a short list and we recommend that you look at Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in the following manner. Do not get too emotional about it. Just look at it as an asset to invest in, with the possibility that it will be a means of commerce in the future. Consider investing in Bitcoins or other digital currency after at least a minimal education on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency in general. Start out small with some discretionary, I can afford to lose it money and build from there. Remember that diversification of your investable assets is a truth that does not go away no matter what new assets or currencies come into existence. >> Check out CCN’s daily Bitcoin Price analysis here Featured Image: DepositPhotos/ albund"
1," ""Spirits told me,"" joked Tim Draper, famous early investor in groundbreaking projects such as the internet, Tesla, Skype and Hotmail among others, answering to a question about his recent bitcoin price forecast.  He was on a Skype call with participants of Crypto Capital World, a crypto investments conference, currently taking place in Vilnius, Lithuania. Earlier in April, Draper estimated that bitcoin will hit USD 250,000 within four years. Now he explained why.  According to the investor, there are trillions of US dollars worth of fiat currencies and in a few years cryptocurrency share will reach at least 20%, while bitcoin's share of the crypto universe's market value will stand at 20%-25%. Also, Draper added that the ""greatest engineers"" are now working on cryptocurrencies, while ""not many engineers"" are working on improvements of US Dollar or Japanese Yen. In 2014, he correctly predicted that bitcoin would pass USD 10,000 mark in 2017. Now the investor explains that back then he estimated that bitcoin would become recognizable by many people, while growing number of available trading platforms would encourage newcomers to buy bitcoin. “This [Bitcoin] is bigger than the internet. It's bigger than the Iron Age, the Renaissance. It's bigger than the Industrial Revolution. This affects the entire world and it's going to be affected in a faster and more prevalent way than you ever imagined,” Draper stated earlier this week and repeated his previous forecast that “In five years you are going to try to go buy coffee with fiat currency and they are going to laugh at you because you're not using crypto."" Meanwhile, Draper is not only one giving bold price target for Bitcoin. This week, John Pfeffer, a partner at Pfeffer Capital, put 1% odds that bitcoin price will reach USD 700,000. However, Pfeffer did not elaborate, when it may happen. The forecast is based on an idea that Bitcoin may become ""the dominant non-sovereign store of value, it could be the new gold, or new reserve currency"". ***
Draper announces his most recent forecast:"
0," After the local power grid operator reported abnormal electricity usage in the north China city of Tianjin, police confiscated a total of 600 computers used to mine cryptocurrency, Xinhua news agency reported. Quoting the local police, Xinhua said that eight high-power fans were seized as well, and that this was the “largest power theft case in recent years.” The report does not note the time that the confiscation took place. The power company monitored sudden increases in line loss on one electricity line, up to 28% at the peak. The phenomenon is usually closely related with increased load current. An investigation found that the junction box of the suspected power user’s electricity meter had been short-circuited - a typical way to avoid billing. This follows China’s many regulatory crackdowns on crypto in general, from banning initial coin offerings to closing down all exchanges in the country, which led to many startups moving abroad to be able to raise funds and people finding new and more dangerous ways of obtaining cryptocurrency, such as using “crypto mules.”  After China closed their crypto exchanges for good, an underground system of “mules” and peer-to-peer networks sprung up to fill in the void left by the strict measures against them. An underground trader would buy cryptocurrencies in other markets and sell them at a premium to investors in China, who are ready to pay more since they have no other choice.  When January saw the height of demand after the sky-high prices of December, underground traders were able to sell Bitcoin for 30% to 40% more than its price elsewhere."
1," Bitcoin could become irrelevant if any of the ideas put forth by MIT students become a reality. First though, let’s go back to 2008 when the US went through the worst recession in history; it was even considered to be greater than the “great depression”. The cause of it ultimately came down to the banks issuing money/mortgages to individuals that they didn’t have and the housing market burst as a result. A year later, the still unknown Satoshi Nakamoto served the world an entirely new solution to the problem and Bitcoin was born. Nakamoto’s original whitepaper outlined a peer-to-peer electronic payment system. It removed the need for a financial institution to be the intermediary between two people when sending money to one another. Now almost a decade later, there are  24 million active Bitcoin wallets currently in use around the globe. Back in 2011, a single Bitcoin was worth around a dollar, but today, BTC is valued at just over $9,300. The coin reached its record-high of just over $20,000 in mid-December 2017 and grew 1,245% in 2017 alone. Despite its popularity, a tech writer at the world-renowned MIT – Morgan Peck, just proposed a scenario (or three) where Bitcoin could become irrelevant. Let’s take a closer look. The first scenario entails the government creating their own form of digital currency – dubbed “Fedcoins”. This is basically the same system we currently have, except everything is electronic. You would set up a “wallet” with the Federal Reserve or an affiliate bank, and you’d be able to buy the digital currency with US dollars at a one-to-one ratio. The nodes, or computers running the blockchain, would be updated by institutions approved by the federal reserve. An undergraduate at Yale, Sahil Gupta, explained that “these authorized nodes could be things like Bank of America, JP Morgan—basically, trusted institutions.” Gupta went on to explain how he believes the Fedcoins will be used: “I’d imagine people first get comfortable spending Fedcoin on things like groceries and movie tickets. As people realize it’s easier than cash, as businesses realize it’s cheaper than credit cards, and as banks realize it’s literally more secure, so goes the process by which dollars are phased out of the money supply, and Fedcoin phased in.” This isn’t a new concept; The Bank of Canada built a simulation for such a currency back in 2016. Sweden has also taken massive steps towards becoming a completely cashless country. Currently, the social media giant Facebook has over 2 billion active users. The second scenario describes a large platform persuading a large group of its members to branch-off and run its own proprietary version of the Bitcoin software. This can be done by way of a ‘hard fork’ at a certain block on the original blockchain. The new group would then start building upon the new blockchain with its own specifications and could build their own corporate coin. This happened last year with the creation of Bitcoin Cash. Peck describes another scenario that seems more plausible than trying to get a large group of individuals on Facebook to hard fork. First, Facebook would create its own third-party Bitcoin wallet and integrate it into its product suite. Peck explains: “For those who already use Bitcoin, the experience is so vastly superior to what they’ve previously experienced that they immediately migrate their funds to their Facebook wallet. Those who don’t yet own any bitcoins, or have never heard of them, could be given the option of earning some on the site, either by watching advertisements or by writing Facebook posts for others to see. For those tired of watching ads, you mix in another fun feature. In exchange for a clean, ad-free experience, users can choose to let Facebook mine bitcoins with their computer’s unused processing power.” Once Bitcoin has entered into the mainstream and is used daily by millions of individuals on Facebook’s product suite, the company could quietly fork and adopt a new version meaning hte original Bitcoin could become irrelevant. Most of these users would have no clue, and now Facebook could control every aspect of its own blockchain. The last scenario in which Bitcoin could become irrelevant, is one that is already unfolding. Peck describes it as the “tokenization of everything” and it involves the world transforming into a hyper-efficient barter system. Every company would release their own cryptocurrency and an automated system would allow individuals to trade each asset seamlessly. >> Martin Lewis Files Lawsuit Against Facebook Over Crypto Scams Cambell Harvey, a professor of Finance at Duke University, explained: “Think of this as an incredibly efficient barter system. Barter is generally inefficient, but if you have a network and you tokenize the goods and services and enable it with a blockchain, it can become very efficient. Without a network, you have to find the person that wants to trade four goats for the cow. That’s very difficult, to find that person. But with a network and with collateralization of blockchain-based tokens, it’s much easier.” Bitcoin could become irrelevant? Really? Could any of these ideas actually come true? Personally, I don’t think that any new system would completely “destroy” Bitcoin, but a new project emerging in the blockchain space could easily make Bitcoin irrelevant. The original blockchain is slow and expensive and sooner or later, it will be passed by another alternative cryptocurrency that can process thousands of transactions in a second, with far fewer fees.

1," Nine years after Satoshi Nakamoto came up with Bitcoin, it is by far the biggest cryptocurrency we have. But since success breeds competition, Bitcoin could well be made redundant by copycats in three scenarios brought to us by TechnologyReview. The first option would be a government takeover. Not too unlikely to happen, given that many government officials, especially in the West, recognize the merits of the blockchain technology, but are wary of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to their decentralized and pseudonymous nature.  This option was described by David Andolfatto, a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and later refined by Sahil Gupta, an undergraduate at Yale University. Gupta created a system where everything works just like Bitcoin does, except the ledger is managed by institutions certified by the Federal Reserve.  Option two would be Facebook pulling a Telegram. Just like Telegram, a messaging app, that is trying to make its own coin that users could send each other or use to pay for services within the network and raised USD 1.7 billion in its pre-ICO, the same thing could happen with Facebook, given that they claim to have around two billion active users around the globe. They wouldn’t even have to make a new coin: they could just fork Bitcoin into a corporate version - or take it over completely. According to TechnologyReview, this would include building a user-friendly Facebook-hosted Bitcoin wallet, integrating it into every profile on the platform, and voila: the whole wallet-alphanumeric-string thing would be much less confusing to your average Joe. They could let users watch ads or write posts to earn coins, or even let the platform mine on their computers. After having 2.2 billion users hooked onto Bitcoin through their own platform, seizing it and making it centralized would only be a step away. Option three is quaintly named: go forth and multiply, in light of what’s already happening. There would be coins for everything, from specific services to groceries, even coins that are exclusive to stores. “My vision of the future is that there would be thousands if not millions of ways to pay for stuff,” Campbell Harvey, a professor of finance at Duke University, was quoted as saying. This is not a new idea: for example, Kodak announced a KodakCOIN, that people could use to license the rights to their photography on their platform. Although evocative of gift cards and coupons, blockchain would now make them easily and securely transferable. In the article by TechnologyReview Harvey suggests to think of this as a barter system: “If you have a network and you tokenize the goods and services and enable it with a blockchain, it can become very efficient.” This would then include moving tokens from one chain to another - an idea similar to exchanging fiat from one currency to another when traveling to another country. A broker would facilitate these exchanges and help you find the coin you need, in exchange for one you already have. The seven billion people not yet using Bitcoin might not care about the freedom of Bitcoin. As TechnologyReview puts it, convenience would always win: “If cryptocurrencies are to be widely used, it will be the habits of the masses, not the wishes of Bitcoin’s early adopters, that determine what becomes of Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision.”"
1," Tim Draper, famous early investor in groundbreaking projects such as the internet, Tesla, Skype and Hotmail among others, remains a fan of Bitcoin. He reiterated his bullish call for bitcoin to hit USD 250,000 within four years at Intelligence Squared U.S. debate presented in partnership with Manhattan Institute's Adam Smith Society on Saturday. When asked how Bitcoin compares with his other famous investments, he said, “This is bigger than the internet. It's bigger than the Iron Age, the Renaissance. It's bigger than the Industrial Revolution. This affects the entire world and it's going to be affected in a faster and more prevalent way than you ever imagined.” “In five years you are going to try to go buy coffee with fiat currency and they are going to laugh at you because you're not using crypto. I believe that there will be a point at which you will no longer really want any of the fiat currency,” he repeated his previous forecast. But the debate didn’t go completely in the favor of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Most of the other participants echoed the old story of anonymous and pseudonymous cryptocurrencies being attractive only to criminals, and expressed their disbelief in a decentralized system. In spite of Draper’s vivacious and to the point approach, the debate ended with 68% of the votes going towards those who think that Bitcoin is a bubble and not really here to stay. In comparison, in the pre-debate vote, Bitcoin believers actually made up the majority, but it would seem that they were swayed by the arguments of the opposing faction."
1," The cryptocurrency sector is a fundamental part of our world. Some people love it, others hate it, but that doesn’t stop the crypto wheels from turning. Now, it seems like every week someone new joins the conversation and expresses their own opinion on the crypto space. The latest to do so is Tim Draper, a venture capitalist.  On Saturday, at the Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, Tim Draper declared a very bold statement. He said Bitcoin will be bigger than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Skype, and Hotmail combined. Draper, who made early investments in the companies mentioned above, also said that Bitcoin is bigger than the worldwide web. In addition, the 59-year old venture capital investor said BTC is bigger than the Iron Age, the Industrial Revolution.  Is he right though? I will admit that it is quite the statement. Plus, it’s not like Bitcoin is a guarantee. The virtual currency is quite volatile. That being said, Draper certainly has experience in the financial world, so his reasoning probably comes from a logical place. The internet investor reiterated his statement Saturday that BTC will hit the $250,000 mark within the next four years. It sounds crazy, but Tim Draper isn’t the only one making optimistic predictions about Bitcoin. Thomas Lee has said time and time again that Bitcoin will reach $25,000 this year. Currently, Bitcoin is selling for $8,911.22, which puts the coin down 0.26% in the past twenty-four hours.  In a recent interview with CoinTelegraph, Draper essentially stated that the masses shouldn’t be surprised if Bitcoin ends up becoming the largest digital currency. Why? Because Bitcoin has what is deemed “a network effect.” As the coin grows in price, the network expands. That’s why Draper stated in the interview that Bitcoin is the leader in terms of cryptocurrencies.  Draper reiterated something like this on Saturday. He gave an example of what life will be like in five years time. Tim Draper stated that in five years when we try to purchase coffee using fiat currency, we will be laughed at. Again, why? Well, according to Draper, because we are not using cryptocurrency.  It’s difficult to say whether Tim Draper’s predictions are correct or not. To say that Bitcoin is bigger than the Industrial Revolution is quite something. But, the crypto sector has proven on a number of occasions that anything is possible. All we can really do is wait and see. I will say, however, that Draper may be onto something when he says Bitcoin will likely win the long-term crypto race.  Bitcoin currently has a market capitalization of $151,133,985,750.  Featured Image: Depositphotos/© olegkrugllyak"
1," There was a decent uptrend initiated this past week as bitcoin gained traction and moved above a major resistance at USD 8,300. Other major cryptocurrencies also gained bullish momentum, but bitcoin cash outperformed ethereum, ripple, bitcoin, ADA and EOS. Other altcoins (small cap) remained in the green zone and the market sentiment is likely to improve further this week. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price jumped recently and moved above the USD 8,300 and USD 8,500 resistance levels. BTC/USD even spiked above USD 9,000 and traded as high as USD 9,020 before starting a downside correction.
The price is currently trading flat near the USD 8,920 level, with resistances on the upside at USD 8,980 and USD 9,000. A successful close above this could open the doors for a push towards the next major pivot level at USD 10,000.
On the downside, weekly supports are at USD 8,800, USD 8,500 and USD 8,250. A push below the USD 8,250 support may clear the path for an extended correction towards USD 7,500. Ethereum
Ethereum settled above the USD 600 level. ETH/USD traded as high as USD 643 and it currently trading 3.2% higher. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 650. A successful break above USD 650 may perhaps call for a test of USD 700.
On the downside, supports are at USD 600 and USD 580. A daily close below USD 580 might ignite a trend reversal in the near term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash enjoyed an amazing week and traded above the USD 1,000 level. BCH/USD opened this week on a much better note and traded above USD 1,400. It is currently trading 19% higher to USD 1,391. Resistances are at USD 1,450 and USD 1,500.
Ripple is stable above the USD 0.85 level. It seems like XRP/USD is facing a strong resistance near 0.90. Therefore, once there is a close above USD 0.90, the price may reach USD 1.00. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, Bytom, Golem and VERI climbed by more than 20% and traded with a lot of strength. The current market sentiment is very positive, suggesting more gains in altcoins this week. To sum up, this could be another green week. However, it would be interesting to see how bitcoin price reacts if it reaches the USD 10,000 barrier."
1," With all manner of mining-related costs rising and crypto prices not recovering from their slump following December 2017, mining profitability is often brought into question. Morgan Stanley, an American investment bank, analysts say that if Bitcoin can't recover USD 8,600 soon, miners will likely find it unprofitable to keep creating the cryptocurrency. In a note on Thursday, equity analyst Charlie Chan and his team told CNBC, “We estimate the break-even point for big mining pools should be USD 8,600, even if we assume a very low electricity cost (USD 0.03 kW/h).” Companies selling mining chips are better off, as the Morgan Stanley model estimates an asic (application-specific integrated circuit) would break even over two years if Bitcoin traded near USD 5,000. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC, is not so sure. Morgan Stanley estimates that about 10% of TSMC revenue now depends on cryptocurrency mining demand. The company has already been forced to cut its revenue forecast from 10%-15% to only 10%, “due to the smartphone weakness and the uncertainty in cryptocurrency mining demand.” Meanwhile, some people have decided to sell their mining rigs and are tweeting offers - but not for this reason. As economist and investor Tuur Demeester points out in a tweet, profitability has dropped, but the original seller in this case disagrees - he’s only selling because his hosting contract hasn’t been renewed.  Yet still as profitable as they were when I originally invested in them...months before profitability exceeded my wildest dreams.  I’m selling because my hosting contract isn’t being renewed. In a Bloomberg tweet, the discussion turns even more interesting. “It’s self-stabilizing,” claims one side of the debate - the majority, really - accusing the news outlet of spreading FUD and bad journalism. Even with the price back above $8,000Even with the price back above $9,000Even with the price back above $10,000Even with the price back above $15,000Even with the price back above $20,000Even with the price back above $30,000Same thing will be said again & again In the end, the decision whether to stop mining comes down to the miners themselves and the question of whether profitability is coming down will resolve itself."
1," Yesterday, we discussed about a possible bullish breakout in bitcoin above the USD 8,250 resistance. The price did move higher and cleared the USD 8,250 and USD 8,300 resistance levels. It boosted the market sentiment and many cryptocurrencies extended gains, including ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin, Neo, ADA and QTUM. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price traded as high as USD 8,398 recently before correcting lower. BTC/USD is currently (GMT 9:30 AM) up 1.45% to USD 8,300, with an immediate support on the downside at USD 8,250, followed by the USD 8,200 pivot level. 
On the upside, the price may perhaps face resistance near USD 8,360 - USD 8,380. If buyers succeed in pushing the price above USD 8,380, there could be an upward acceleration towards the USD 8,500 level. 
The technical structure is bullish above the USD 8,000 support, and there are chances of further upsides in the near term. Ethereum
Ethereum extended gains above the USD 540 and USD 550 resistance levels. ETH/USD traded towards the USD 590 level before correcting lower. It is currently trading 7.5% higher from the USD 530 low.
On the upside, there are many hurdles below the USD 600 level, starting with USD 580. On the downside, supports are at USD 550 and USD 540. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash continued to outperform most major cryptocurrencies. It is currently trading 9.7% higher to USD 975. Recently, it traded close to the USD 1,000 level before it faced a strong selling interest. BCH/USD remains in a bullish zone, but an upward break above the USD 1,000 resistance won’t be easy.
Ripple blasted higher today and broke many resistances such as USD 0.75, USD 0.80 and USD 0.85. XRP/USD is now in a solid uptrend and it could continue to move higher towards the USD 1.00 level. On the downside, supports are at USD 0.80 and USD 0.78. Other Altcoins Market Today
Almost all altcoins are trading in the green zone. It seems like the crypto market is poised to extend gains since the total market cap is now above the USD 350 billion. The next target for buyer could the USD 500 billion. Overall, there are many bullish signs, but traders should not discard possibilities of a short-term correction from the current or a bit higher levels."
1," Passionate and somewhat controversial Bitcoin Cash supporter Roger Ver is stirring the proverbial pot once again through his Twitter account. This time, he is offering USD 100,000 to Reddit, a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website, if they appoint a new moderator to the popular subreddit r/Bitcoin. Ver, who owns Bitcoin.com and has signed on to the “Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin” movement, is now calling Reddit out for not being “a profitable company” lately, and is offering to help them out of this predicament by paying them USD 100,000 if they “simply appoint a moderator to /r/Bitcoin who supports free speech.”  The two most popular subreddits dedicated to Bitcoin are r/Bitcoin and r/BTC, and the two are in a tense relationship that’s only been worsening over the years. r/Bitcoin has often been accused of censorship its moderation of posts related to the years-long Bitcoin scaling debate. r/BTC, however, is more of a Bitcoin Cash subreddit, regardless of the name - and Roger Ver himself is one of the moderators.  Although Ver has his number of supporters cheering him on in the replies to his tweet, some of the answers, especially the contrary ones, are genuinely funny. For example, one user replied: Speech isn't free if you pay $100k for it :) Others have gone much further. A user tweeted: I really like dogs. I will pay @reddit $100,000 to appoint a dog-friendly moderator on r/cats. Dogs are the real cats. This unjust censorship has gone on too long! BABIES R DYIIIINNNNGGGG!!!! But of course, Reddit does not really need the money. Last year, the company raised USD 200 million in funding, placing its total valuation at USD 1.8 billion."
1," Mark Karpeles, ex-CEO of the Mt. Gox exchange and often vying for the spot of least favorite person in the crypto community, has found that it’s not very easy to find and/or keep a job when you’re considered a villain after losing 850,000 Bitcoins. Although 200,000 of those Bitcoins ended up surfacing somehow and the rest is believed to be stolen by hackers, this didn’t help Karpeles with the fact that he’s still in the middle of a lawsuit for charges of embezzlement, manipulation of electronic data, and breach of trust. Job prospects would seem grim for anyone else. However, Karpeles’s LinkedIn profile now lists the position of new chief technology officer of London Trust Media, a Denver-based company that boasts the world’s largest paid virtual private network (VPN) service and is investing in cryptocurrency projects. Karpeles confirmed this to Fortune in a written message, after a bit of nudging. His new employer hasn’t been so shy with broadcasting the news. Andrew Lee, co-founder, chairman and chief of lab division at London Trust Media, said for Fortune, “Mark fought and fell. And although he fell, his skills, experience and know-how unarguably continue to exist. <...> I am more than willing to give a second chance to Mark in this fight’s critical hour.” Lee doesn’t mind Karpeles’s past. “I wouldn’t dare say that the person who architected the Titanic should never again architect another ship,” he said. How this will turn out remains to be seen, although Karpeles is only too happy to wash his hands of crypto, citing his lack of belief in the purpose of Bitcoin.  Given that Mt. Gox was created as an exchange for Magic: The Gathering Online card game players, perhaps Karpeles’s problem with Bitcoin is that it exceeded this purpose."
1," If you’re not much of a chart analyst and really just look at the Bitcoin price and maybe at its percentage of change within the past 24 hours, you probably haven’t heard of the Vomiting Camel. It’s actually a thing in the stock market, too. Best of all, it’s a joke that’s gone too far. Some chart analysts like to find pictures in charts that remind them of something, presumably because just looking at charts does not seem like the most interesting pastime in the world. These patterns are also a handy tool for surmising what sort of behavior can be anticipated next. Katie Martin of the Financial Times got the idea of a vomiting camel on the internet and made a whole gag out of it. It comes down to a technique similar to recognizing constellations: quite a bit of imagination. She thought it was an obvious joke - but not many caught on, really. She explains the whole thing in a post, showing how she just drew camels wherever, and tried to make them throw up. In the case of Bitcoin, last November she was completely right, though.  Except, in 2014, CNBC ran a segment on the vomiting camel that was tongue-in-cheek, but was taken too seriously. And this April, TradingView, for example, had a piece called “The Dreaded Vomiting Camel of Bitcoin.” ""The pattern speaks for itself of how the camel is drawn over the lifespan of the stock/coin. The end of this pattern is the actual vomit which show the 3 red arrows of the drop that may be impending,"" the piece said. Taking it seriously is just not thinking it through. It’s a badly drawn picture of a sick mammal, how predictive can it be for any market? Still, if you can find a pattern in market behavior through MS Paint pictures of animals, godspeed. She concludes her explaining post by saying, “If you buy or sell anything based on the camels, then the very best of luck to you. You'll need it. On the plus side, I guess it's no sillier than any other form of technical analysis. Cut me into any profits.”"
1," The past few hours were very bullish as most altcoins rallied sharply and gained between 15-50%. This indicates that the market sentiment is bullish and there could be more upsides in the near term. On the other hand, bitcoin, ethereum and ripple consolidated in a tight range above key supports in the bullish zone. Once these major cryptocurrencies stage an upside breakout, the market could accelerate higher. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is slowly gaining momentum above the USD 8,000 support. However, BTC/USD must clear a strong sell wall near the USD 8,250 - USD 8,300 zone. 
A successful close above the USD 8,300 resistance may perhaps start a fresh bullish wave toward the USD 8,700 and USD 9,000 levels. The price is waiting for a catalyst for a bullish breakout. 
On the downside, supports are near the USD 8,000 and USD 7,800 levels. Ethereum
Ethereum is showing signs of an upside break above the USD 530 level. ETH/USD may soon extend gains above the USD 535 and 540 levels. If buyers gain momentum, the price could even break the USD 550 level.
If there is a downside correction, the USD 520 and USD 510 levels are likely to act as decent supports. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash once again performed really well among the top five cryptocurrencies. BCH/USD tested the USD 900 level and is currently trading 6.1% higher at USD 888. Above the USD 900 resistance, the price could make an attempt to test the USD 1,000 level.
Ripple is trading nicely above the USD 0.70 level. XRP/USD traded close to the USD 0.74 level before starting a downside correction. It seems like the price may continue to grind higher toward the USD 0.78 level in the near term. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins rallied sharply today, including Monaco, Pundi X, BAT, Mithril, WAX, Augur, ReddCoin, TenX, Bitcoin Private and SmartCash. The current market sentiment is super bullish, suggesting further gains during the upcoming sessions. Bitcoin traders should keep a close watch on the USD 8,300 resistance for an upside break towards the USD 9,000 level."
1," Cryptocurrency trade monitoring site VeneBloc has reported a massive spike in Bitcoin buying in Venezuela, with a record USD 1 million worth of bolivar to BTC purchases made on April 17 alone. Bloomberg reports that Venezuelans are increasingly turning to the cryptocurrency market as a means of buying dollars and other foreign currencies, with BTC-to-dollar trades also on the rise in the country – while the bolivar tumbles in value. The government imposed laws restricting foreign exchange trading in 2003, although many businesses in the country only accept payment in dollars and a thriving black market for foreign currencies has also developed. The country has recently unveiled its own state cryptocurrency, the Petro, which is backed by Venezuela’s huge oil reserves. Earlier this week, the Petro (which is banned in the United States), received an award from Russia’s leading crypto association, the Russian Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Association, who praised the Petro’s “outstanding contribution to the development of the blockchain industry.” Some experts have claimed the Petro was developed with Russian support, with government officials playing a key role – a charge denied by the country’s finance ministry. Earlier this month, the Venezuelan government issued a decree stating that all state-owned businesses must accept payment in Petro, while the president created two cabinet posts to deal with cryptocurrency-related matters."
1," Bitcoin Price (BTC) is largely controlled by trader’s sentiments regarding the future fundamentals of cryptocurrency markets. Trader’s sentiments have been improving sharply in crypto markets over the last week, driven by bullish price predictions and regulator input to control unfair practices. Rather contrary to the previous precedent of “going against” government interference and regulation,  the management of Ripple (the third largest cryptocurrency), has invited the government to play their role in cryptocurrency markets. “We’re at that time now where we need more clarity and rules, and we need more certainty. It’s a good time to start revisiting that ‘wait and see’ approach taken by regulators,” Ryan Zagone, director of regulatory relations said.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com The cryptocurrency markets didn’t react sharply to the notices sent by U.S. Attorney General to thirteen cryptocurrency exchanges. In fact, bitcoin price moved above $8000 level again today after dipping to three day’s lows on Tuesday. Bitcoin price was under pressure yesterday due to the tax season, which is now officially ended. New York Attorney General Eric believes that cryptocurrency exchanges should clearly disclose basic facts about their operations. “With cryptocurrency on the rise, consumers in New York and across the country have a right to transparency and accountability when they invest their money,” said Attorney General Schneiderman in the release. Bulls are capitalizing on improving traders sentiments over the last week. Technical chart analysts are also adding to bull’s optimism. Moving averages and oscillators started showing positive signals for bitcoin price movement. Analysts believe bitcoin price movement shows the potential bullish trend considering Bollinger bands model. Technical analysts expect bitcoin price to hit the next resistance level of $8500 soon. Market pundits, however, are hoping bitcoin price to cross $20,000 levels in the days to come. They claim higher regulations will attract new investments from retail and institutional investors.

1," Back in 2015, a Chinese entrepreneur and his partner spent USD 2.35 million bidding on a private lunch with an investor and one of the richest man in the world Warren Buffett, whom he considers his idol. Back then, they were hoping to get some investment advice from the legendary investor. Today, the 31-year-old businessman still uses his photo with Buffett as his phone's wallpaper. However, he is far from thrilled with the opinion his hero has on the sticky subject of cryptocurrency. Out of all the things he’s learned from Buffett, Sam Ling has kept an appreciation for index funds closest to his heart - but he’d now like to apply that outlook to crypto. He told CNBC, “Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are too volatile, and that's why we are launching cryptocurrency indexes. Over the past six months, our index has a lower decline than bitcoin during corrections, but has outperformed bitcoin by 50 to 80 percent during upsurges.” Out of all the advice he’s received at this USD 2.35 million lunch, Ling recalls, “Buffett touched on lots of issues during that lunch, but in the end, he said, ‘Focus on what you are doing and you are already successful.’ This quote really left me with a deep impression and I followed his advice.” But Ling is not that starstruck: he believes in the power of crypto. “Warren Buffett just won a 10-year bet that an index fund would outperform a collection of hedge funds over that time. And I want to make a bet with him that my cryptocurrency index will outperform his portfolio over the same period.” Buffett has not yet commented on the situation, but the world waits to see whether he accepts the bet or not."
0," With the none too anticipated Tax Day looming in the US on April 17 and nobody really knowing how to file their crypto assets, many traders think this is exactly what’s holding Bitcoin and other coins back this year. Spencer Bogart, partner at Blockchain Capital, told CNBC, “Tax-selling has been a significant factor in downward crypto prices over the past few weeks. I would expect this downward pressure to abate after tax day.” The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) views Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as property, meaning profits from transactions are subject to capital gains tax. The problem with that is that, while this is clear in principle, nobody really knows how to apply it to their crypto gains, many of which people didn’t document in time. Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told CNBC that US traders owe a total of USD 25 billion in taxes for digital currency holdings due to the prices rising more than 1,300% last year in the case of Bitcoin. Lee is also the only major Wall Street strategist to issue crypto price targets, and in his opinion, Bitcoin may be hitting a similar bottom to where it was a month before it hit USD 20,000 in 2017 (it was USD 7,000 - USD 8,000 at the time). Pantera Capital Founder and CEO Dan Morehead said in an investor letter published last week that bitcoin is ""highly likely to have exceeded USD 20,000 within a year."" An investor Tim Draper, famous for how bullish he is in Bitcoin, also predicted a price jump: by 2022, the cryptocurrency could hit USD 250,000."
0," Analysts are optimistic about the future of Bitcoin price: Bitcoin price (BTC) traded in the green during the weekend, and the largest coin added $1400 to its price last week.  The latest bull-run continues to receive support from bullish sentiments; bulls believe BTC price has hit the bottom early in the previous week and it is set to make a significant recovery. BTC price trades around $8000 mark today, up 14% in the last seven days.  Tim Draper, an early supporter of Tesla, Skype, and SpaceX, predicts Bitcoin price to hit $250K in the next four years.  Tim has 30,000 bitcoin in his portfolio, and he says he will never convert these coins for fiat money.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Brian Kelly Backs Tim Draper Opinion Brian Kelly, founder, and CEO of BKCM LLC, supported Tim’s prediction. Kelly said “it sounds crazy” to consider that BTC [Bitcoin] already had a 4,000 percent return over two years and a 3,000 percent return in four years may be a “continuation of the trend we’ve seen.” Brian Kelly, however, moved one step forward. He compared the bitcoin mania to Internet mania in late 80’s and early 90’s. He believes bitcoin is behaving like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) during the early days of the internet revolution.  He further added, “I think this technology is going to work, it’s going to be game-changing, but it’s very early days so that we can have this massive volatility,” The expert expects higher trading volume will allow the Bitcoin price to reach $250K in the next four years. Market pundits are blaming tax season, social media bans and uncertainty regarding regulators role for the vast bitcoin price correction during the last thirty days. Tax season is now almost over, and the new investments are flowing into the market – which is creating a bull run in crypto markets, analysts say. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization jumped almost $70 billion in the last four days, driven by 14% appreciation in Bitcoin value and a substantial contribution from altcoins.

0," Bitcoin has revolutionized the world of finance. Its price is perhaps the most consulted aspect of the coin and at the same time (ironically) the least “revolutionary.” Over-volatility of price and unstoppable news of frauds and substantial investments have sparked a lot of debate and predictions; something that has become a popular conversational topic among hodlers and cryptocurrency enthusiasts. The community’s interest in these fluctuations is so high that exclusive memes and words have even emerged: Hodl, Lambo, moon, scamcoin, are the best known. Other jargons such as whale, buy the dip, weak hands, fomo, pump and dump, etc. have been adapted from different environments and are already natural to investors and fans on the cryptosphere. After the exponential rise in bitcoin prices, the strong bearish trend since January led to posts with more HODLS and fewer MOONS in social media. The financial authorities of traditional banking were busy cataloging the bitcoin as a bubble with some discouraging forecasts that did not help at all to reverse the trend. But it seems that the trend has bounced back after hitting the $6000 support level thanks to some announcements pointing to substantial investments in crypto by  giants such as George Soros, the Rockefellers, and Goldman-Sachs. From that moment on, the bulls began to gain strength in the economic game of crypto markets. One of the first to take the plunge with a value prediction was Tim Draper, a venture capital investor founder of Draper Associates, a VC firm with an investment portfolio of at least 80 successful companies including Tesla, Baidu, Coinbase, Bancor, Skype, Twitch and Robin Hood. In a rather striking act and with a market still bearish in the short term, he dared to predict a price of $250,000 by 2022. A figure that may seem exaggerated after such a sharp drop. However, Mr. Draper’s predictions do not seem to be very far from reality as they are gaining confidence and followers who trust in the possibility of the realization of this prophecy. One of those who has recently supported this prediction is Brian Kelly, Founder, and CEO of BKCM LLC. A company focused on crypto investment. In an interview for CNBC’s “Fast Money” show, Melissa Lee (host), asks Mr. Kelly for his opinion of Draper’s predictions, which may sound crazy to the public, to which, he responded with a tone of confidence “It sounds crazy, but think about it this way: That’s 4 years from now, that’s a 3000% return from here -which again sounds crazy- but over the last two years bitcoin had a 4000% percent of return. So, now again, it’s parabolic, but it would just be a continuation of the trend that we’re seeing” For this type of trends to occur, Brian Kelly says it requires an increase in the volume of transactions: something that large institutional capitals could promote, contributing in turn to lower volatility: “If the number of transactions […] catch up a bit, then I do think we’ve bottomed here, and I do think we’ve got a sustainable bull run ahead of us.” When asked about his “Personal forecast,” Brian Kelly seems to agree with Tom Lee’s prediction: “We can get transaction volumes up again. Then, there’s no reason why this couldn’t be at 20-25 thousand by the end of the year again; we can make a new high.” Featured Image: twitter"
0," Out of the 69 Bitcoin forks to date, just 10 are tradable on exchanges, according to Forkdrop.io data. Combined, these have a value of USD 941, or around 0.12 BTC, news.bitcoin.com reported. Additionally, without Bitcoin Cash, only USD 206 or 0.026 BTC remains - a possible proof of the futility and triviality of Bitcoin forking. Following the launch of Bitcoin Cash last August, subsequent forks have been rapidly deteriorating, quality-wise. Forkdrop.io has a handy list that shows most of these forks are not tradable. The website’s resources include guides to claiming these forked coins and sections on passive and active airdrops. If you hold (or HODL) BTC, you can claim these forks for free. But with these numbers, claiming them may just not be worth it. Bitcoin Candy, Bitcoin Cloud or even Bitcoin Holocaust are names that hardly could inspire any confidence.  Forked altcoins, although fewer in number, are just as useless - forkdrop.io lists 18 altcoin forks, although many more have forked by cloning the code and then adding their own twist. A well-known example is Verge, a fork of Dogecoin that was never made available on a 1:1 basis to Doge holders. A total of six Ethereum forks, three Litecoin forks, and six Monero forks are listed on the website, along with a couple of others. And out of all the altcoin forks, three of them are tradeable - with a combined value of USD 20. Interestingly, there is one fork not listed on the website is Bitcoin Private, as it simultaneously forked from Zclassic and Bitcoin. It started trading at around USD 80, but has dropped four-fold in under a month. In short, forking may be destined for failure no matter what the resulting coin is like after Bitcoin Cash - or at least that’s what all the other examples are telling us. The cost of creating a hard fork is essentially zero, so we will continue to see more and more hard forks that attempt to create a user base via forking coins to an already established community, as reported by Cryptonews.com. According to experts, in order to evaluate a hard fork and its potential it's always good to ask three questions: 1) Does the fork solve a real problem? 2) Is the team behind the fork credible and competent? 3) Is there a healthy community and open discussion surrounding the fork? If the answer to any of these three questions is a ""no"", it should raise a red flag for an investor."
0," This past week, there was a solid bullish wave in bitcoin and altcoins. The crypto market turned green and prices soared between 10-25%. More importantly, BTC/USD broke two important resistances at USD 7,500 and USD 8,000, opening the doors for more gains this week. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price cleared a major hurdle at USD 8,000 this past week and moved towards the USD 8,400-8,500 zone. On the upside, BTC/USD is facing a crucial resistance near USD 8,500, which must be cleared for further gains.
On the downside, there are many supports such as USD 8,000, USD 7,800 and USD 7,500. If the pair drops below the last mentioned USD 7,500 support, there could be a change in the trend.
In the short term, the price may trade in a small range before it makes an attempt to overcome sellers near USD 8,250 and USD 8,500. Ethereum
Ethereum also followed bitcoin and registered around 20% gains this past week. ETH/USD settled above a major barrier at USD 500, and it is currently consolidating gains above the stated level.
Weekly resistances on the upside are at USD 530 and 550. A push above the USD 550 level could clear the path for a bullish acceleration toward USD 600. On the downside, supports are at USD 500, USD 480 and USD 465. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash had a good run and its price moved past the USD 700 and 750 resistance levels. BCH/USD is now positioned nicely above USD 750 and it seems to be preparing for a break above the USD 800 resistance.
Ripple finally broke to the upside and settled above the USD 0.60 resistance. If the current momentum stays intact, XRP/USD could move above USD 0.70 and test the USD 0.75 level in the near term. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, ICON and Cardano are performing really well. ICX price is up 10.8% to USD 2.77, and ADA price broke the USD 0.22 resistance. Both coins are now in a positive zone and they may continue to grind higher. Overall, bitcoin and altcoins are now in the green zone. Having said that, there could be range moves or downside correction this week before the next upward wave."
0," Media outlet Chosun Biz reports that according to a survey of 800 South Korean adults, one in three citizens aged 18 and above has invested in cryptocurrencies. The survey was conducted by exchange platform Bithumb, who said that traders’ average holdings were worth some USD 5,050. Per the survey, 35% of respondents said they had used a cryptocurrency exchange platform, while 40% of cryptocurrency investors said “curiosity” had driven them to buy tokens. The survey also found that older investors tended to make much bigger investments, with respondents in their fifties investing an average of over three times as much in cryptocurrencies as people in their twenties. There is also a huge discrepancy between the average high among investors, which stands at some USD 21,000 per the survey, and the average low investment - which is a mere USD 215. Respondents also said that security systems and system stability were the most important factors to consider when choosing which exchange platform to use. April has been a mixed bag for South Korean exchange platforms, with a trading information leak suspected at Bithumb last week, the arrest of two rival exchange CEOs the week before – and a range of new partnership deals announced at the start of the month."
0," Can you imagine traveling to a different country solely with the purpose of buying something? That’s what a man from Malaysia just did – and it went horribly wrong. It might have been better if the man was going to Singapore for a shopping spree, but he wasn’t. The man went to Singapore with the intention of purchasing a wad of Bitcoins, and instead, he found himself at the center of the latest Bitcoin scandal. Here’s what happened. On Thursday, reports surfaced from various local mediums which stated that two men were arrested in Singapore. The charges? Being the masterminds behind the latest Bitcoin scandal. That is if you consider what the two men did to be a “scandal”. According to the reports, Mr. Pang Joon Hau flew from Malaysia to Singapore solely to purchase Bitcoins. Not only that, Mr. Pang flew to Singapore expressly to purchase Bitcoins with cash. $365,000 to be exact. Mr. Pang, who was assaulted along with his broker, had set plans to meet with two Bitcoin brokers. He was scheduled to meet them at his hotel on Sunday, April 8, 2018. Things didn’t go as planned. Both men are said to have assaulted Mr. Pang and fled with the cash – all $365,000. As unfortunate as this incident may be, one cannot help but think of how uncommon it is for people to transact the digital currency in person. It is for these reasons the police in Singapore have decided to launch an investigation into Mr. Poon. According to various reports, the Singaporean police will be focusing on why Mr. Poon came to Singapore (aside from the purchasing of the currency) and where Mr. Pang obtained this kind of cash in the first place. Singapore has been reasonably vocal when it comes to the cryptocurrency sector. It is one of the many countries to have called for more regulation on digital currencies, with Singapore making the call on February 6, 2018. >>Can Blockchain Help the Data Crisis? Not Likely – Here’s Why. Of course, this isn’t the first Bitcoin scandal to surface this year. It’s definitely not going to be the last, either. At the start of 2018, a famous cryptocurrency blogger, Pavel Nyashin, was robbed in his own home after bragging about the wealth he obtained from cryptocurrency. Nyashian had 24 mln rubles in cash stolen from a safe that sat in his home. Meanwhile, regulators in Texas warned the public today of a potential “widespread fraud” in the cryptocurrency sector. As for Bitcoin (BTC) itself, the virtual currency jumped by $1,000 in one hour yesterday. This caused Thomas Lee, Wall Street analyst, to come forward and say he still believes Bitcoin will hit the $25,000 mark. Featured Image: twitter"
0," Notorious American venture capital investors and long-time cryptocurrency bull, Tim Draper, has just set an astronomical prediction for Bitcoin (BTC) by the year 2022. Yesterday, at a blockchain party held at his self-named Draper University in San Mateo, California, he predicted that the world’s largest cryptocurrency would reach $250,000 a coin. The video can be seen below.  Tim Draper’s 2018 Bitcoin Prediction is $250,000 by 2022 (live stream) from Bitcoin    In the video Draper says: “I’m thinking $250,000 a bitcoin by 2022. Believe it. They’re going to think you’re crazy but believe it. It’s happening, and it’s going to be awesome!” Serious winds (of change) at our block (chain) party last night. Predicting bitcoin at $25k by 2022. — Tim Draper (@TimDraper) April 13, 2018 While this may seem a bit crazy, given the bear market the past few months Draper has a fairly good track record of predicting Bitcoin’s price movements. In 2015, the VC mogul was right when he predicted that BTC would reach $10,000 by the end of 2017 because it soared past $13,000. With that said, market observers aren’t taking his bullish forecast lightly. Draper holds an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from Standford and has an MBA from Harvard, coming from a long family line of venture capitalists. Blockchain is the Future Draper isn’t just keen on digital currencies but believes blockchain technology will completely transform and revive finance, healthcare and various other industries. He spoke to the San Mateo Daily Journal about blockchain and said: “The blockchain is one of the most transformational technologies that has happened in the history of the world, and it is totally worth celebrating,” he said. “We look forward to lots of crypto fun and excitement from the event.” Draper isn’t the only billionaire eyeing the blockchain technology, the Rockefeller family, whose worth is around $1 trillion, have partnered with Coinfund to aid blockchain-based start-up companies. The Rockefeller family isn’t interested in turning short-term profits but sees this as a long-term investment in blockchain technology. The entry of Old Money into the cryptocurrency and blockchain space is another sign that blockchain is here to stay. >> Tom Lee Predicts BTC to hit $25,000 Featured Image: Silicon"
0," Yesterday, we discussed how there was a sharp rise in altcoins, but bitcoin was struggling. Later, BTC joined the party, broke a crucial resistance at USD 7,000, which resulted in a sharp upside move of more than USD 1,000. It seems like the crypto market consolidation phase completed, resulting in increase in trading volumes.  Fundamentally, a key development was from the Islamic community. There was a declaration by an Islamic scholar that bitcoin is compatible by Sharia Law. More importantly, bitcoin and ethereum charts were heading towards a technical breakout during the past few weeks. The recent upside drift suggests that the breakout was bullish and prices are likely to continue higher. There was a solid short liquidation and unwinding of short (sell) BTC trades, resulting in a short squeeze from well below USD 6,800 to well above USD 8,000. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price rocketed above yesterday’s mentioned USD 7,000 resistance. BTC/USD gained around 20% and traded above the USD 8,000 level. The pair is now trading at USD 8,106 and it may perhaps continue to rise towards the USD 8,500 level.
If there is a downside correction, the price may find support near the USD 8,000 level. Below the stated USD 8,000, the price could test the USD 7,800 support.
On the upside, before the USD 8,500 barrier, the price may find selling interest near the USD 8,250 level. However, the current trend is super bullish and bulls are completely in control for a run towards USD 8,500. Ethereum
Ethereum also followed bitcoin and rocketed above the USD 500 level. ETH/USD is currently trading 22% higher at USD 515. On the upside, the next major hurdle for buyers is at USD 540.
On the downside, the broken resistances at USD 500 and 480 are likely to act as supports in the short term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash moved sharply above the USD 700 level and is currently up 15% to USD 760. BCH/USD pair is now seems to be heading towards the USD 800 level, which is a key resistance.
Ripple soared higher and moved past the USD 0.60 resistance, which is a bullish signal. XRP/USD is now in a positive zone and the price may continue to move higher towards USD 0.70. Other Altcoins Market Today
Almost all coins are trading in the green zone with gains between 10-25%. A few coins such as MITH, BTCP, Steem, OMG, IOTA and WAN outperformed and registered heavy gains today. Overall, the crypto market is back in the green zone with a lot power and heavy volumes, which are great signs of a bullish trend."
0," In the past 24 hours as of the time of writing, the whole cryptocurrency market is in green, and the only red ones - Tether and aelf - among the 100 biggest coins by market cap are falling by small margins.  Thomas Lee, head of research of Fundstrat Global Advisors LLC, cited a combination of Santander’s plan for a blockchain-based payment application, tax-related selling almost over and speculative short investors being squeezed out of the market for the surge, Bloomberg reported. Given that this is perhaps the most bullish shift in the market in this year, following the bloodbath in winter and the subsequent bearish atmosphere, how is the community reacting? People are not as enthusiastic as before, actually. However, the community is showing more maturity than ever before, perhaps: as one user of Reddit points out, if this jump had come a few months earlier, “pеople would have shouted end of bear market moon lambo and so on,” but now, the discussion has turned to “leveraged shorts, manipulation, scepticism towards the pump and overall constructive thinking” in a big step away from the usual bright-eyed optimism. A commenter on the same thread thinks that, “The moon/lambo types have already forgotten about crypto and moved on to the next shiny thing.” In another thread, user u/florian_ehrbar says, “I’ve been watching this [market jump] and my jaw just keeps dropping!” as proof that nobody is quite indifferent. Twitter is also silent, as the only people celebrating seem to be fans of mostly controversial altcoins such as TRON. The community is showing more restraint than ever before. This does not mean people are not overjoyed, however. Anyone who has invested in almost any coin in the crypto space is gaining, but what’s conspicuously lacking are the memes and the “when moon” and “when lambo” comments. Although benign and not unfunny (when not overused), they did cause the rest of the world to see the crypto space as a childish place, not yet a force to be reckoned with. This may just be a step in the right direction for the building and development of a serious new market that could change the nature of the game. *** Top 10 coins in the past 24 hours (8 AM GMT, Friday):"
1," Early this morning, Bitcoin (BTC) jumped by $1,000 in just one hour and the crypto bulls are coming in hot now. One crypto bull, in particular, Wall Street analyst Thomas Lee, believes that Bitcoin could rise to as high as $25,000, reports CNBC. Lee told Futures Now that “We still feel pretty confident that bitcoin is a great risk-reward and we think it could reach $25,000 by the end of the year.” Lee, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat, was noted earlier in stating that the U.S. tax season would cause a mass crypto selloff. By now, with taxes due April 17th, he says that much of the selling pressure has begun to ease off. (Could this be another reason for the crypto market green that we’re seeing today?) >> Indian Crypto Exchanges Consider Relocating in Response to Indian Crypto Ban Bitcoin is currently selling for $7,693.79, which puts the coin up 11.36% in the past 24 hours. To reach Lee’s predicted price of $25,000, BTC would have to grow another 225% by the end of the year. In one year, since April 12th, 2017, Bitcoin has grown by 541%, so it’s certainly doable, but the question is, will it? From the start of this year to now, Bitcoin’s price has dropped by 45%, according to CoinMarketCap data. This means that Bitcoin will have to recover by that much and then some in order to reach Lee’s estimated price of $25,000. Although Bitcoin has been spiralling downwards since the start of this year, since its inception in 2013, Bitcoin has grown by 5,586% overall. According to Lee, it’s time for Bitcoin (BTC) to recover what it has lost since achieving its all-time high back in mid-December. “It’s overdue,” Lee told ‘Futures Now.’ “Bitcoin was incredibly oversold. When you look at metrics like price-to-book, which is ‘money cost,’ or our bitcoin misery index, it’s pretty much what you saw at the end of the 2014 bear market, not the start.” Do you agree with Thomas Lee? Will Bitcoin grow to $25,000 by the end of this year? >> Bitcoin Price Watch – Primed for Breakout in Q2 Featured image: Forbes"
1," Bitcoin price bounced back this morning in a rather grand fashion, shooting up $1,000 in an hour. As per CoinMarketCap, the Bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate skyrocketed to an April high of $7,796.25 at 04:44:35 UTC. At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $7,614 and is up 9.76% percent in 24 hours time. BTC’s price is down -18.7% for the month and down -44.7% year-to-date.  Source: CoinMarketCap Last year, was an astronomical year for cryptocurrency as it caught mainstream adoption. BTC shot up a staggering $20,000 in its price in 2017, with most gains occurring towards the latter half of 2017. Mainstream media caught wind of cryptocurrency and everyone began buying in. Bitcoin’s record high of just over $20,000 occurred when the Bitcoin futures were being set to launch on Wall Street in mid-December.  >> Bitcoin Frenzy Since early January, the entire cryptocurrency market has been on a downtrend. It hit record highs of $830 billion on January 7th but is now sitting at just under $300 billion.  Source: CoinMarketCap While Bitcoin may have shot up in price, it’s trading volume in the last 24 hours raises some major red flags and it seems I’m not the only one that noticed. According to CoinMarketCap, BTC’s trade volume is only $8,160,910,000 USD, in 24 hours time. Rather surprising as its price was at one point up nearly 11%.

1," The past few sessions were mostly green for altcoins, whereas bitcoin struggled to gain upside momentum. It is still well below the USD 7,000 resistance, which is a bearish sign. Technically, altcoins are showing many bullish signals, but if bitcoin joins the party, there could be a sharp upside move in the crypto market. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price attempted an upside move, but it could not move above the USD 7,000 resistance. BTC/USD traded near USD 6,990 before starting a downside move.
The price is currently down 0.3% and is trading near the USD 6,830 level. The next supports on the downside are at USD 6,750 and 6,600. 
To initiate an upside move, bitcoin buyers need to break the USD 7,000 barrier. It is an important resistance, therefore, a successful break above the stated level could open the doors for a solid bullish wave in the near term towards USD 7,500. Ethereum
Ethereum traded nicely and made a new weekly high above the USD 435 level. ETH/USD is currently up 1.3% to USD 422, with an immediate support at USD 415. Below the mentioned USD 415 support, the price could retest the USD 400 level.
On the upside, the price faces a short-term resistance at USD 435, followed by the USD 440 hurdle. Above the stated USD 440, the price may attempt a break above USD 450. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is showing positive signs above the USD 650 level. BCH/USD is currently trading 1.55% higher to USD 661. The pair needs to gain momentum above USD 680 to gain strength. On the downside, supports are at USD 650 and USD 640.
Ripple bounced back sharply and moved above USD 0.50. There are a few positive signs emerging, but XRP/USD must hold gains above the USD 0.50 level to remain in a bullish zone. Other Altcoins Market Today
Altcoins market is mostly green today lead by coins such as EOS, ZIL and ADA. EOS was one of the leaders since it jumped more than 30% and is currently trading above the USD 8.0 level. More importantly, EOS is now ranked fifth in terms of the total market capitalization. The current market sentiment is very positive, but bitcoin’s struggle to gain strength could lead to a downfall."
1," Paying in crypto now comes at a 50% premium, it would seem. Hedge fund manager Claudio Guazzoni de Zanett has decided to sell his 12,380 square feet (1,150 sq m), 7 bed, 14 bath home in New York for a measly USD 30 million. He will also accept crypto, says the ad - but then it’s worth the equivalent of USD 45 million. Aside from BTC, he will also accept Ethereum and Ripple. This increase is to offset the volatility in crypto price, he said to Wall Street Journal: “I’m a true believer in these networks, but it’s very volatile. They could be down 60% in two weeks.” And he does seem to believe: according to his LinkedIn profile, he has founded Zanett Cryptocurrency Group in 2016, and appears to have been investing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain since at least 2015. The 22-foot-wide, marble-and-limestone house at East 76th Street near Fifth Avenue has served as Mr. Zanett’s family compound since 1994. The house dates back to 1904 and includes an original vault in the basement area that extends under the street. “Fabulously situated,” as the ad says, on a block of the Upper East Side's Gold Coast between Fifth and Madison Avenues, the question remains - is it really worth USD 45 million in BTC? Interestingly, this is the same man who was slapped with USD 8,000 in summonses for advertising this very same home as a short-term rental only a year ago, according to New York Post. State laws forbid to even advertise short-term rentals in multiple-unit buildings for fewer than 30 days unless the owner is also living in the rented unit. Perhaps your early investing portfolio in crypto has already gone to the moon, but let’s face it - you’d much rather buy yourself a garage of lambos for this amount. But if you're still interested in the townhouse, here is how it looks:"
1," A JPMorgan Chase credit card customer is suing the financial services provider for slapping what he labels “sky-high” interest rates and fees on the bills of cryptocurrency investors. Brady Tucker, of Idaho in the United States, says the credit card provider began charging him interest rates of as much as 30% per year – as well as additional fees – on cryptocurrency purchases made through Coinbase exchange in January this year. Tucker says the fees are disproportionate and unprecedented, and lodged a class-action suit at a federal court in Manhattan, New York. Tucker says he wants a full refund of the fees he has been charged – as well as damages of USD 1 million. Tucker made reference to a quote made last year by JPMorgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, who has denounced Bitcoin in the past. Last year Dimon said he would “fire” any of his staff whom he found trading cryptocurrencies for ""stupidity."" Tucker wrote, “It appears that in addition to firing its ’stupid’ employees, Chase has elected to start fining its ‘stupid’ customers: unilaterally.” JPMorgan has recently announced it will not allow cryptocurrency purchases, saying that account holders might dispute charges if they bought coins from what they later discovered were fake initial coin offering (ICO) issuers. In February, JPMorgan said Bitcoin’s design might contain a fatal flaw whereby its decentralized nature could prevent it from being able to handle liquidity shocks."
1," The Bitcoin Bubble is popping… this time for real… because Bank of America says so. For the 278th Time. Bitcoin is not only the king of cryptos but also the king of bubbles. According to Bloomberg, a study by Bank of America Merrill Lynch on the behavior and evolution of Bitcoin’s prices places it as the most significant asset price bubble in history. The study compares the price trends of bitcoin with other similar phenomena such as the U.S. stock market in 1929 crash in the Stock Markets, the Mississippi Company, and South Sea Company in the 18th century, the behavior of gold pricing, and the famous Dutch Tulip bubble.  The graph attempts to show that of all the bubbles, bitcoin is the one that has achieved the most significant growth in the narrowest range of time. Whereas the most critical bubbles such as tulips have a value of less than 40x increase in value, the graph shows an increase (in a similar timeframe) of at least 60x for Bitcoin. In the last few months, the Bank of America has been very attentive to the behavior of bitcoin, and while just a few weeks ago they told the SEC at about the danger that Bitcoin posed to the expansion of their financial services, today their research results do not seem to contrast with their previous assessments. Such claims are not new to the world of Bitcoin: 99Bitcoin has kept track of how many times the media has “killed” Bitcoin, and with 278 “deaths” registered since 2010, an average of almost three rumors per month is more than enough reason to show that it is not always necessary to believe what the powerful say. Just as an example, let’s look at the behavior of Bitcoin prices today:  That looks pretty “Bubbly”, right? In weeks BTC has lost almost 60% of its value!… And the trend does not seem to stop Before we forge a response, let’s look at a bit of a similar graph:  This graph, as you can see, shows a previous BTC price fluctuation. What is happening now is nothing new, it has already occurred (and in worse proportions), and it is merely part of the natural behavior of an asset that is being capitalized, and that is not only being inserted into the market but is radically changing it. It is unfair to make such decontextualized comparisons, so let’s put things into perspective a little and analyze this graph.  Bank of America research is either decontextualized or charged with the subjectivity of an institution that studies a phenomenon considered “risky” for its existence. On social networks, the community has expressed some opinions. A notable example is Blockchainchick who made a comparison of Bitcoin with the opinions spread towards Amazon; a company that has been able to demonstrate its successful career despite the FUD that it suffered during its consolidation. Bitcoin has arrived in the world of finance to stay. Although the future is not written, the confidence of the users and the massive adoption will put a number on its future price; confidence can easily be damaged by third-party opinions (Pump and Dump, anyone?). However, if there is one thing that characterizes the community of crypto users it is that despite the nervousness they may have in the short term, there is always unity and optimism in the paradigm shift that cryptos can achieve… and that is perhaps the best reason to prove that Bitcoin will be bullish soon. I, personally, prefer one bitcoin over one tulip. Featured Image: Twitter "
1," In another attempt to value Bitcoin and predict prices, analysts at Barclays, a British bank, score points for originality, likening it to an infectious disease, and saying that it might be over very soon. In a note to clients on Tuesday, Barclays analyst Joseph Abate writes, “Like infection, transmission - especially to those with ‘fear of missing out’ - is by word-of-mouth, via blogs, news reports and personal anecdotes. However, once full adoption is approached, the price decline is sustained and rapid.” This model suggests that crypto awareness is universal at this point, so only a tiny group of the population could catch speculative interest, and current holders are also developing “immunity” to more investment. “We believe the speculative froth phase of cryptocurrency investment – and perhaps peak prices – may have passed,” Abate says. The Barclays model splits the population into three sectors: the susceptible ones, the vulnerable and the immune people. The infected make up 0.1% of the population who first bought crypto with an unknown long-term fundamental value, while the susceptibles make up 25% due to FOMO (fear of missing out), mostly. A number of people are “immune” and not likely to ever buy. Still, according to the analyst, crypto may see an increase in demand from weaker economies with little to no investment opportunities. Abate explains, “Cryptocurrencies may have a home in low-trust corners of the global economy. Broader adoption of crypto technologies faces critical challenges and strong incumbents.” The total cryptocurrency market capitalization, according to Barclays, has a “generous upper bound” between USD 660 billion and USD 780 billion - an amount near the total at the end of January."
1," BitFlyer, Japan's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, has partnered with SBC Medical Group for a deal that will allow the latter’s customers to settle their bills in bitcoin. SBC operates the Shonan Beauty Clinic chain, Japan’s largest network of cosmetic surgery, dermatology, acupuncture and dentistry clinics. In total, some 74 clinics nationwide will now accept bitcoin payment via BitFlyer’s blockchain-powered payment platform. The maximum transaction amount is 2 million yen (around USD 18,700). BitFlyer has already enabled bitcoin pay at over 10,000 Japanese outlets, including electronics retailer BIC Camera, the Marui Group’s department stores and fashion and accessories outlets, the HIS tour operator and restaurant booking site Gurunavi. BitFlyer yesterday announced it was working on an open blockchain query language that it hopes to have available “within a year.” In related news, per media outlet Okinawa Times, the Japanese Cryptocurrency Exchange Association has claimed that Japanese cryptocurrency trading and transactions in FY2017 totaled some USD 645 billion, 20 times higher than FY2016 figures – with over 90% of crypto trade conducted in BTC."
1," Barclays compares Bitcoin to infectious disease: The investment bank Barclays likens the spread of the Bitcoin (BTC) to that of an “infectious disease” spreading, reports Business Insider Australia. Barclays analysts based their findings on the models that epidemiologists use to track diseases. The models were compared to Bitcoin’s price swings from the past seven years. The analysts were checking if there were any connections between how an infectious disease spreads and how Bitcoin has performed in the past to see if they could predict any of Bitcoin’s future. The results were surprising. Barclays stated: “We developed a theoretical model of an asset price with a pool of speculative investors and compared it with actual Bitcoin price behavior to see what it might imply for the future dynamics. The model has clear parallels with compartmental models of the spread of an infectious disease in epidemiology.” Barclays says this connection is why Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are slackening off now. Back in December, when the crypto hype was at its highest, prices swelled. However, like a spreading infection, it can only continue growing for so long. >> Bitcoin Wallet Supporting Lightning Network Removed from Google Play They explained this reasoning further: “As more of the population become asset holders, the share of the population available to become new buyers – the potential ‘host’ population – falls, while the share of the population that are potential sellers (‘recoveries’) increases. Eventually, this leads to a plateauing of prices, and progressively, as random shocks to the larger supply population push up the ratio of sellers to buyers […] prices begin to fall. That induces speculative selling pressure as price declines are projected forward exponentially. Analogously, this occurs with infectious diseases when the immunity threshold is reached; ie, the point at which a sufficient portion of the population becomes immune such that there are no more secondary infections.” So, essentially, growth (spread) will stagnate because there will be no one left to ‘catch the cold that is Bitcoin,’ if you will. Is this the stage that we’re in right now? “Unlike past peaks in Bitcoin prices, the survey evidence, based on our modelling, suggests that the speculative bubble in crypto currencies may have passed its peak,” stated Barclays. Do you agree? Bitcoin is currently selling for $6,830.23, which puts BTC down 66% from its all-time high in December, according to CoinMarketCap data.

1," There was a solid start to the week yesterday as bitcoin climbed above the USD 7,000 level. Other major cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, bitcoin cash and ripple also gained traction. However, they all failed to hold gains and started a fresh bearish wave. It seems like a technical rejection in bitcoin and altcoins coupled with a new round of selling. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price declined 5.6% and is currently trading at USD 6,750. If BTC/USD continues to move down, the next support is near USD 6,600. However, the most important support is around the last low at USD 6,400. 
Should the price fail to stay above USD 6,400, there are chances of a downside reaction towards USD 6,000 in the near term.  On the flip side, the price has to trade above the USD 7,000 level to overcome an increase in selling pressure.
Above USD 7,000, the next resistance awaits at USD 7,200 and 7,250. Ethereum
Ethereum was rejected from the USD 430 region and is currently down 7.1% to USD 395. ETH/USD is back in the red zone and if sellers remain in control, it could decline towards the all-important USD 360 support.
To start a recovery, the price must settle above the USD 400-405 area. Above the mentioned USD 405, the price may perhaps retest the USD 430 resistance. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash failed to stay above the USD 650 level and declined sharply. BCH/USD is down 6.3% to USD 635 and it seems like the pair may continue to move down. Immediate supports on the downside are at USD 620 and USD 600.
Ripple is back below the USD 0.50 support. XRP/USD failed on many occasions to settle above the mentioned USD 0.50, which puts it at a risk of further declines in the near term. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many altcoins followed bitcoin today and declined, but Verge remained in the green zone. XVG is up 15% to USD 0.082 and it may continue to gain upside momentum. The company was successful in completing a fork, which increased buying sentiment during the past three days. To sum up, it seems like bitcoin and altcoins failed to capitalize and started a fresh bearish wave. Having said that, if BTC/USD moves back above USD 7,000, there could be a decent recovery."
1," In another effort to find ways to mine crypto as cheaply as possible, from combining the excess heat from your mining rig to grow tomatoes or heat your own room to moving to small towns where electricity is cheaper, using Google may just take the prize for most original idea. Uri Shaked is an Israeli “Google Developer Expert for Web Technologies, Maker and Public Speaker”, according to his Medium profile. He  managed to find a way to use Google’s BigQuery, a big data analytics web service, for crypto mining. Although his Medium post goes deep into the technical details, from explaining how mining works in the first place to deep into how and why this is actually free, the gist is this: his approach is technically just generating a large amount of random data using pre-existing tables, as mining basically involves guessing the right number. Although BigQuery only allows up to 1 terabyte of data analysis per month and then charges per analyzed byte above that amount, as far as they are concerned, he’s analyzing zero bytes per hash. In other words - for free. He also points out that while this works in theory, it is not an actual process that could generate him any sort of income: “even if such a miner was built, when competing with all the dedicated mining hardware running around the world, it would make me roughly USD 5 a year,” his post explains, going on to clarify that although not viable, knowing that crypto can be mined this way is “priceless.”"
1," The “blockchain vs Bitcoin” narrative is an old one, and the stance among the more traditional audience such as regulators, bankers and investors was very often blockchain over Bitcoin - in that the cryptocurrency is the much-touted bubble, while the underlying technology offers exciting new opportunities. But is this still the case, or has the time for cryptocurrency come at last? Checking the prices of crypto shows us that the bear market continues and shows no signs of slowing - all the biggest coins have taken a nosedive this year. For Brian Kelly, founder and CEO at BKCM LLC, an investment firm focused on cryptocurrencies, this means more screen time for blockchain. “Last year was all about the froth, and the promise of, 'Hey, this guy's building the new Facebook.' I think this year is going to be about building the Ciscos [an American multinational technology conglomerate],” he said to CNBC. In his opinion, “2018 is going to be the year of infrastructure and also the year of Ethereum competitors.” Adding to this, he says there are many risk rewards to using a platform like Cardano that runs the blockchain technology for its coin ADA: “It's relatively new. You can do smart contracts on it. You can do blockchain 3.0. It's an Ethereum competitor in the year of Ethereum competitors.” But the perspective could have shifted from blockchain back to crypto in the opinion of Elizabeth Stark, the CEO of Lightning Labs. She told a never-before told story for Yahoo Finance about the overpowering narrative of the superiority of blockchain and how it impacted Lightning Labs:  
“When we first pitched my company Lightning Labs, we actually took the word ‘Bitcoin’ out of our deck and our marketing material because it was so much about blockchain. Now, I feel like we’ve entered into a ‘Bitcoin, not blockchain’ world, where people understand the value of cryptocurrency technology and what these can bring.” “When we first pitched my company Lightning Labs, we actually took the word ‘Bitcoin’ out of our deck and our marketing material because it was so much about blockchain. Now, I feel like we’ve entered into a ‘Bitcoin, not blockchain’ world, where people understand the value of cryptocurrency technology and what these can bring.” This could mean better business for her: since Lightning is a second layer built on top of the Bitcoin protocol that can facilitate faster and cheaper transactions, because the payments happen off-blockchain, Bitcoin could become more viable as a payment option. She goes on to explain, “We’re talking many thousands of transactions per second, one day maybe even millions per second… Bitcoin at its base layer can’t do that. But Lightning, because it’s this layer on top of it, can.” Not everyone agrees: in the “Bitcoin is a bubble” corner that the industry seems to have gotten used to, Bank of America Corp says Bitcoin, “the biggest bubble in history,” is popping. As reported by Bloomberg, Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett wrote that Bitcoin is tracking the downfalls of the other massive asset-price bubbles in history less than one year out from its record, comparing it, for example, to the famed tulip mania of the Dutch. So, to answer the titular question of focus: it depends on whom you ask. The more time goes on, the more obvious it becomes that not every crypto-skeptic can be won over, and that many will remain bearish on crypto and bullish on blockchain. Luckily, however, people such as Ms Stark are working on solutions that will bring crypto closer to the general public without separating it from its roots and the much-loved blockchain technology. It is in the best interest of the industry as a whole to believe that, while both sides have hard-working believers, the technological advancements of society may well move beyond our wildest dreams."
0," Not sure where you can spend your Bitcoin (BTC)? Here’s a list of some of the major retailers that accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Yes, Microsoft is one of the retailers that accept bitcoin. You won’t be able to buy any of the big stuff, like an Xbox or Surface laptop, but Microsoft does accept it for things like games, movies, and apps. You can deposit Bitcoin (BTC) into your Microsoft account and then use it to make purchases from the Windows and Xbox stores (but not the Microsoft Online Store.) It should also be noted that Microsoft doesn’t allow refunds once Bitcoin has been deposited into your account. So, if you’re a gamer or movie lover who has a lot of Bitcoin hanging around, this is great news for you! Here’s what Microsoft has to say about its Bitcoin policy, and all the finer details. Through Expedia, you can book your next hotel stay with Bitcoin. Coinbase currently handles all of the Bitcoin transactions for Expedia (so, Coinbase is essentially acting like PayPal for Bitcoin here). Expedia’s been accepting Bitcoin payments since 2014 – and maybe one day we’ll be able to book flights, even whole packages, with cryptocurrency. But for right now, I can content myself with a hotel stay on Bitcoin. Here’s why Expedia decided to become an early adopter of Bitcoin. >> NEO, VeChain (VEN), and Verge (XVG): Growing Today – But Why? Overstock.com is a massive online retailer that sells things from furniture to clothing to pet supplies and practically everything in between. Overstock.com was one of the first retailers to accept Bitcoin and you can use Bitcoin to pay for pretty much everything on the site. The best part? It’s not just Bitcoin. Overstock.com also accepts Ethereum (ETH), Litecon (LTC), Dash, Monero (XMR), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Learn more about Overstock.com’s cryptocurrency policy. Shopify is an ecommerce platform where merchants can set up their own online shops, in a similar vein as Etsy. All Shopify merchants now have the ability to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for their products. However, this doesn’t mean that every merchant listed with Shopify chooses to enable this feature. You’ll have to confirm merchants individually. Here’s a list, from Shopify, of some of the merchants accepting Bitcoin (as of 2013). Have a Shopify store and didn’t realize you could allow Bitcoin payments? Here’s some more information. This is just a small fraction of retailers that accept Bitcoin (BTC) as a form of payment, to give you a taste of what’s out there. Sniff around and you’re sure to find more.

0," Well, that was fast. ‘Eclair’ – the first Bitcoin wallet supporting the Lightning Network, has been removed from the Google Play store, mere days after being added. Not long ago, on April 4th, a French tech company called ACINQ added the first mobile wallet that allowed for Bitcoin transactions via the Lightning Network. The app was available through the Google Play store for Android devices fitted with the operating system version 5.0 and higher. Several days later, on April 7th, the company tweeted they had lost the signing key for the wallet. This essentially means they are unable to update the app. We just discovered that we may have lost the signing key allowing us to update the app Note: key isn’t compromised, just was accidentally deleted and isn’t recoverable — ACINQ (@acinq_co) April 7, 2018   This effectively prevents us to patch the app in case of bugs, and we already have suspicion of a bug related to unilateral closing, that we wouldn’t be able to fix if it is confirmed — ACINQ (@acinq_co) April 7, 2018 >> Three funny blockchain chrome extensions that will make you smile The result was that the company removed the app from the Google Play store. PSA: We have disabled the mainnet Eclair Wallet Android app from Google Play and removed the apk link from our github page. — ACINQ (@acinq_co) April 7, 2018 So, over the span of only four days, Eclair was added to Google Play and then subsequently removed. Like I said, that was fast (you could even say it was lightning fast). ACINQ believes a bug compromised the Eclair application, and because they have lost the signing key, the company is unable to resolve the issue. What now? ACINQ has said that it is working on a new version of the Lightning Network-enabled Bitcoin wallet and will release Eclair 2.0 as soon as they can, republishing it on Google Play. >> NEO, VeChain (VEN), and Verge (VRX): coin updates Featured image: Hackernoon"
0," Bitcoin (BTC) price has been facing stiff resistance from bears in creating a sustainable rally above the $7000 mark over the last week. BTC price crossed the $7500 level during Wednesday trading before plunging back to $6600 on Thursday; the coin trades around $6700 today and the market pundits envisage BTC price to make further price corrections.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Bitcoin and the rest of digital currencies are purely falling on declining trader’s confidence in crypto markets, due to regulators crackdown and analysts concerns over the fair value. London-based Capital Economics succinctly explained the difference between cryptocurrency and the stock market selloff. The firm said, “We expect equity markets to fall as investors cotton on to the fact that rising U.S. interest rates will slow economic growth. But the main factor driving down the price of bitcoin is likely to be a realization that it is simply not a credible long-run alternative to conventional currencies.” Along with rebuffing the link between crypto and stock markets, London-based Capital Economics also raised questions over the underlying value of bitcoin. The firm calls bitcoin ‘worthless’ and expects BTC price to fall significantly from its current level. It’s undoubtedly true that bitcoin doesn’t have any fair value to support its price on exchanges; the cost of mining each coin stands below $1000 in some countries – which depends mainly on electricity prices. Bitcoin gained substantial momentum last year only on speculations and the massive growth in trading volume from criminal activities. Research reports revealed that criminal activities accounted for half of the bitcoin’s trading volume during the final quarter of last year. BTC price plunged more than 45% in the first quarter after analysts started raising questions on its underlying value and anonymity feature. Featured Image: Twitter"
0," The past few sessions were mostly bearish on cryptocurrencies as bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, ripple and litecoin failed to make an upside move. Yesterday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a notice and banned all regulated entities to deal with any individual or business dealing in virtual currencies such as bitcoin. The market sentiment remains bearish and if sellers step up the momentum, there could be more losses. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price declined further after settling below the USD 7,000 support. BTC/USD even broke the USD 6,800 pivot level and is currently down 4.4% to USD 6,580. An immediate support awaits near USD 6,500, followed by a key support at USD 6,200.
If the price fails to stay above the USD 6,200 support, it may perhaps test a crucial support at USD 6,000 in the near term. 
To start a recovery, the price has to break the USD 6,800 pivot level and surpass the USD 7,000 barrier. Above USD 7,000, the price may move in a positive zone with the next hurdle at USD 7,200. Ethereum
Ethereum is now trading well below the USD 400 level. ETH/USD is even finding it hard to hold a crucial support at USD 360. If sellers succeed in breaking the USD 360 support, the pair may even clear the USD 350 level.
On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 380, followed by the all-important USD 400. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is slowly grinding lower towards the USD 600 support. BCH/USD is under a lot of pressure and it could even break the USD 600 support. A break below USD 600 may perhaps put the pair on a bearish path towards USD 500.
Ripple is in a declining mode towards the USD 0.45 level. XRP/USD failed to stay above the USD 0.50 level and is now gaining bearish momentum towards the USD 0.42 support. Other Altcoins Market Today
Most altcoins are down today and remain at a risk of more downsides. The market sentiment has turned further negative since RBI’s announcement. There was an increase in selling pressure in the Indian circuit, which grabbed the market attention. Overall, bitcoin and all major cryptocurrencies are trading in a bearish zone and well below key support levels."
0," Yesterday, we discussed whether bitcoin price can stay above a major support at USD 7,000 or not. It failed to hold gains above the stated level and declined towards USD 6,600. Similarly, major cryptocurrencies such as ethereum, bitcoin cash, ripple and litecoin also traded lower and declined 5-8%. It seems like the last recovery wave was not convincing and prices are now back to where they started the week. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price broke the USD 7,000 support and traded as low as USD 6,560. BTC/USD is currently down 6.5% to USD 6,830 and is showing a few bearish signs.
The pair must stay above the USD 6,600 support to avoid any further declines. Below the stated USD 6,600 support, there is a risk of a downside break towards the USD 6,000 level. An intermediate support is at USD 6,200. 
On the upside, the broken support at USD 7,000 may once again act as a resistance. Above this last, the USD 7,200 is the next resistance. Ethereum
Ethereum failed to hold gains above a crucial support at USD 400 and declined towards USD 365. ETH/USD is currently struggling near the USD 380 level and is trading 5.5% lower from the USD 404 high.
If the price has to recover in the short term, it has to settle above USD 400. On the downside, supports are at USD 365, 360 and 350. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash continued to weaken and is currently trading well below the USD 700 pivot level. It is down 7.3% to USD 638 with an immediate support at USD 620. Below USD 620, the price may even break the USD 600 level.
Ripple is down 7.2% and is trading below USD 0.50. There was no upside break above the USD 0.55 level yesterday, which increased selling pressure on XRP/USD. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, Tron traded nicely as TRX price gained roughly 25% and moved above the USD 0.04 level. Bithumb listing did the trick for TRX recently and improved buying sentiment.  To sum up, the market sentiment has turned bearish again. However, it seems like bears are lacking momentum, which could result in a fresh upside wave in the near term."
0," Bitcoin price has already lost more than 60% of its value from its all-time high and analysts expect BTC to make a further price correction before the coin completely stabilizes. Warnings and price crash predictions from analysts along with bans from big banks and social media platforms have significantly impacted cryptocurrency trader’s sentiments. Bitcoin price recovered slightly from the lows of $6,500 that it hit during the weekend; BTC trades in the range of $7000 today after a death cross pattern failed to create any significant impact on price.  Analysts, however, expect bitcoin to fall another 50% in the days to come before creating a sustainable uptrend. Steve Bellotti of Digital Currency Holdings believes BTC price could hit the $3000 level, representing a decline of 50 – 60% from its current level. Steve Bellotti, also thinks that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will present better buying opportunities in the days to come. He said: “So, if you are patient, you are putting capital to work, this is a great opportunity versus right in December right before Christmas time where there was an awful lot of hype in the market, a lot of new retail customers joining every day etcetera and that has been taken out of the market. “So I think the market is much safer to enter into today. But we may not be at the extreme bottom yet,” he added. Reports of scams, frauds and illegal activities involving cryptocurrencies have shattered traders confidence in crypto markets over the past few months. Followed by an advertisement ban, Google announced a prohibition on crypto-mining browser extensions that are available for its ‘Chrome’ browser. Regulators all around the globe are in the process of creating the regulatory framework for cryptocurrency exchanges and trading activities – which could create additional volatility in prices and trading volume.

0," Yesterday, a decent upside recovery was initiated in the cryptocurrency market. Most coins staged a decent recovery, but later they failed to gain upside momentum. At the moment, prices are correcting lower and trading near crucial support levels. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price traded towards the USD 7,400 and USD 7,500 resistance levels where it faced strong offers. BTC/USD failed to move past the mentioned resistances and started a downside correction.
It is down 0.8% to USD 7,280 with an immediate support at USD 7,200. The next major support on the downside awaits at USD 7,000, which must holds losses. If the price fails to stay above USD 7,000, the price may move back in a bearish zone.
On the other hand, bitcoin buyers must push the price above the USD 7,400 and USD 7,500 resistance levels to accelerate gains. Ethereum
Ethereum traded above the USD 400 level, but it could not break the USD 415 - USD 420 resistance zone. ETH/USD must stay above the USD 400 support to avoid a downside reaction.
Should there be a downside break below USD 400, the price could decline back towards the previous swing low at USD 560. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash failed to hold gains near the USD 700 and is currently down 0.85% to USD 680. BCH/USD must settle above the USD 700 to continue trading higher. On the downside, supports are near USD 660 and USD 650.
Ripple outperformed today and is currently trading 2.3% higher to USD 0.535. XRP/USD may continue to rise towards the USD 0.60 level, with supports on the downside at USD 0.52 and USD 0.50. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today’s best performer was Dragonchain (DRGN) as it climbed up by around 30% and broke the USD 0.80 resistance. There were a few positive development in the Dragonchain community, sparking buying interest.
Additionally, there were a few other altcoins which gained momentum today such as IOStoken (+25%), Ardor (+18%), Verge (+16%), Ontology (+14%) and Lisk (+11%). The overall market sentiment is currently neutral to bullish, and if bitcoin price fails to hold the USD 7,000 support, it could turn bearish in the near term."
1," The ‘Death Cross’ pattern failed after Bitcoin (BTC) price moved above from 50-day’s low of $6,500. BTC price soared sharply on Monday and extended the uptrend into today’s trading, amidst concerns regarding the immediate price crash on Death Cross pattern – which occurred on Bitcoin price chart on Sunday when its 50-day moving average has cut the 200-day moving average from the top. BTC price started recovering losses after hitting 50-day low of $6,500 during the weekend. Bitcoin currently hovers in the range of $7,300, up more than 5% today following a sharp recovery on Monday.  Source Image: bitcoincharts.com The uptrend in BTC price confirmed that death cross pattern fails to create any damage to prices. The entire cryptocurrency market is in the green since the start of this week. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) recovered sharply from four months lows, amid a broader rally in crypto markets. “People need to recognize that crypto is still young and like the internet, those early years can be ugly,” Tatar said. “I do hope that things stop getting thrown at bitcoin, but as most teens know, life comes fast and hard from all directions during the early years,” analysts say. Bulls are of the opinion that regulators scrutiny and advertisement bans would help crypto markets to streamline their operations, driven by regulators potential to vanish criminal activities and price manipulation techniques. Jack Tatar, the co-author of “Cryptoassets, said, “while recent bans on cryptocurrency advertising by Facebook, Twitter and Google hurt prices short term, they could legitimize the space.” Regulators role is turning vital in enhancing crypto markets credibility after reports of scams, frauds, and thefts in the last couple of months. Regulators all around the globe are asking cryptocurrency exchanges to get a registration certificate or expect a crackdown on them. Japan and the United States are among the key players that are taking the lead in regulating cryptocurrency markets. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© spaxiax"
1," Bitcoin Price Crash: Bears have been holding onto crypto markets over the last couple of weeks, with negative reports and increasing regulatory concerns. The selloff intensified in the previous two days when technical factors also started showing bearish trends for Bitcoin price and its future fundamentals. BTC price crashed at a double-digit rate to a 50-day low on Thursday, and the coin extended the decline into Friday trading. Bitcoin price is down more than 40% since hitting $11,700 early in March. Bitcoin price traded around $6,700 in early trade before paring some losses. The market capitalization of largest coin fumbled to $114 billion.  Technical factors on the price charts impacted Trader’s sentiments. Its 50-day moving average cut the 200-day moving average from the top, creating a long bearish trend for the price. Technical analysts predict a huge crash in bitcoin price after its 50-day MA collides with 200-day MA from above. Analysts say, “when you couple Death Cross trend with the fact that bitcoin has been trending steadily lower since the launch of futures, I think that it is a major negative.” Bulls, on the other hand, still of the opinion that cryptocurrency markets are on the verge of significant rebound – which would be similar to late 2017.   Brian Kelly said: “Bitcoin, just like the spot FX markets, follows technical’s closely. Therefore these support levels gain more importance. If these levels hold, then it will confirm the uptrend from August is still valid.” >>Ripple, Cardano, and NEM: Which Coin Lost the Most Since 2018 Started? China, which has already banned all sorts of cryptocurrency platforms, is likely to extend its crackdown into the next year.

0," Bitcoin price plummeted sharply today after trading in the narrow range of $8,000 level on Wednesday. The latest selloff isn’t due to ads bans, regulators clampdown or warnings; the downtrend was purely supported by traders concerns over the technical factors on price charts – market participants are predicting a massive crash in BTC price in the days to come, driven by a Death Cross trend. Bitcoin price declined more than 7% today, down 15% in the last seven days. TV analyst Abigail Doolittle said, ‘the “death cross” trading data for bitcoin, suggests that we could see bitcoin go all the way back below $1,000 per bitcoin”.  Source Image: bitcoincharts.com A death cross trend happens when the 50-day moving average (MA) cuts the 200-day MA from the top – suggesting a considerable drop in price based on technical factors. Bitcoin price chart clearly shows that the 50-day moving average is likely to cut the 200-day moving average from the top, which is creating a long-term bearish pattern for BTC price. “That being said, any time the 50-day crosses the 200-day, it should flash a warning…and when you couple that with the fact that bitcoin has been trending steadily lower since the launch of futures, I think that it is a major negative,” Jim Iuorio of TJM Institutional Services said. Jim Iuorio’s concerns look undoubtedly true considering declining trading volumes and declining trader interest. Cryptocurrency markets are fumbling sharply over the last two months on regulators concerns and the use of digital currencies in illegal activities. Regulators all around the globe are creating their framework to get better control of crypto markets. >>Bitcoin (BTC): Wall Street Says HODL and Abra CEO Says Boom The U.K. has recently formed a task force to look at the pros and cons of cryptocurrency markets, while the U.S. regulators are also inspecting crypto markets to come up with strong rules and trading guidelines.

0," “Buy the dip and HODL,” said Bitcoin bull Thomas Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisor, on CNBC’s post-market show ""Fast Money"" on Wednesday. “The mood in crypto is terrible right now,” the esteemed Wall Street analyst said. “Long-time holders are worried because they have big gains and they're worried about falling prices. But Bitcoin is a great store of value. It works really well. It's kind of boring, because it's not the latest and most exciting project. But it also is one of the most liquid ways to get exposure to crypto.” In a Wednesday note, Lee wrote about the 10 best days for Bitcoin each year, comparing them to the traditional market: “Market timing is generally discouraged in traditional equity investing. If an investor missed out on the 10 best days (for S&P 500 [an American stock market index]) each year, the annualized return drops to 5.4% (ex-10 best), from 9.2%. In other words, the case for buy and hold in equities is the opportunity cost of missing out on the 10 best days.” So if an investor was to miss out on the 10 best days for Bitcoin, the annualized return drops 25% annually, Lee writes. On average, Bitcoin was down every year with the exclusion of the top 10 day gains, according to Fundstrat data. 2017, for instance, had a total of 12 days representing the full-year return of BTC. But the analysis for the S&P 500's performance goes back to 1954, while the nine-day average for the full-year gains of Bitcoin only goes back to 2013. This means it is unclear whether historical analysis on the decades-old stock market is appropriate for the far more volatile cryptocurrency that's only 9 years old. Bitcoin is trading at the breakeven cost of mining, at about USD 8,000, based on a model by Fundstrat, Bloomberg added. ""We see positive catalysts for Bitcoin later in 2018, including the clarification of regulatory hurdles,"" Fundstrat analysts wrote in the note. In addition, Bitcoin's current low selling price, gives investors who aren't familiar with cryptocurrency a chance to study the industry, rather than jumping in feet first, CNBC reported citing Lee. ""As bad as it feels right now, Bitcoin has a lot more upside,"" he said."
1," There’s no denying that panic has swept through the crypto sphere as of late. With the crypto ad bans by major companies like Google, Facebook, and most recently Twitter, prices of cryptocurrencies have taken a beating as many people believe this to be the end. Have no fear, though, because this isn’t the end. Crypto will recover, and it will continue. People are still interested in the space. Just ask Wall Street or Bill Barhydt, the CEO of Abra. CNBC reported that a Wall Street analyst is for HODLing Bitcoin (BTC). Wall Street analyst Thomas Lee took a stock investing approach to Bitcoin and said that it is an “attractive buy.” Lee’s approach is that only a few days in the entire year account for the overall return on investment for something like Bitcoin: “The reason ‘buy and hold’ (or HODL) makes sense for BTC is that a handful of days each year account for the bulk of gains for BTC. For instance, in 2017, a total of 12 days represent the full-year return of BTC.” That means that if you’re looking to make a profit on Bitcoin, you need to HODL, through the good and the bad, to capture those days. However, can a stock investing approach really be applied to Bitcoin, when it’s been around for far less time than the decades-old stock market and is way more volatile? With less data to work from, it’s harder to generalize results. Be that as it may, Lee’s reasoning is something to keep in mind for those inclined to panic when Bitcoin drops.  Lee’s argument essentially comes down to this: be patient and HODL through to the good days. >> Ripple (XRP) joins forces with blockchain consortium Hyperledger Those good days may be approaching fast, according to Abra CEO Bill Barhydt. Abra runs a global digital wallet app where you can buy, store, and invest in up to 20 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. In an interview with Business Insider, Barhydt claims that Bitcoin is in store for another price rally – and soon. He believes that once institutional investors, like hedge funds and asset managers, start exploring cryptocurrency, Bitcoin prices, along with the rest of the crypto market, will recover. “That’s going to happen this year I think,” said Barhydt. He explained his reasoning: “I talk to hedge funds, high net worth individuals, even commodity speculators. They look at the volatility in the crypto markets and they see it as a huge opportunity. Once that happens, all hell will break loose. Once the floodgates are opened, they’re opened.” >> Coinbase adds ERC20 support – altcoins to come? Barhydt pointed out that the December crypto price rally of last year corresponded with Japanese financial institutions investing in cryptocurrencies. He believes this will happen again once the West gets going. “There really is zero large-scale institutional money from the west in crypto right now. That is happening in Japan. Once a large sizable chunk of Western institutional money starts to come in — watch out.” He also believes that the regulation currently cracking down on cryptocurrency markets will actually end up encouraging institutional investors to move into crypto. In a more regulated space, more institutional investors will want in, fearing loss and scam less. Already, there is evidence of some institutional involvement in crypto. Mark Yusko, the founder and CIO of Morgan Creek Capital, announced that the firm is looking to raise as much as $500 million to start a new crypto and blockchain exclusive hedge fund. The game CryptoKitties recently received $12 million in funding from a group of investors including Andreessen Horowitz. So all this panic, it may be for nothing. What do you think?

1," The past few sessions were mostly bearish as major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and litecoin extended declines. Bitcoin price fell to a new monthly low below USD 7,800 before buyers protected further losses. At present, BTC is consolidating losses, but many altcoins already started an upside move. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price traded towards the USD 7,720 level before starting an upside correction. BTC/USD is currently up around 0.7% to USD 7,950. 
On the upside, the pair may soon break the USD 8,000 resistance. However, there are many barriers on the upside such as USD 8,200 and USD 8,500. Only a close above the USD 8,500 level could clear the path for more gains.
On the downside, the USD 7,800 level is an initial support, followed by the last swing low of USD 7,720. Ethereum
Ethereum tumbled below the USD 450 level and tested the USD 440 level. It is currently trading flat near the USD 455 level. ETH/USD must gain upside momentum above USD 475 to start a decent recovery.
Above USD 475, the price may perhaps test the next major resistance at USD 500. On the downside, the USD 440-450 region is a crucial support in the near term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash failed to follow BTC and remains in a bearish zone below the USD 890 level. BCH/USD is down 2.66% to USD 884 and it remains at a risk of more declines. On the upside, the USD 900 and USD 920 levels are important resistances.
Ripple is slowly recovering and is currently trading 0.32% higher to USD 0.58. XRP/USD must succeed in breaking the USD 0.60 and USD 0.62 resistance levels for more recoveries towards USD 0.65. Other Altcoins Market Today
As mentioned, there were many small altcoins such as ONT, MITH, SYS, BTM, PIVX and EOS, which posted decent gains between 10-20%. Out of these, Ontology (ONT) was the best performer. Its price is currently up around 50% to USD 2.69. There were interoperability rumors, which pushed ONT price higher. In short, it seems like there are signs of a short term recovery in the crypto market. However, bitcoin price must move above USD 8,200 and USD 8,500 to confirm recovery signs."
0," The Spanish police have arrested a cybercrime gang hailing from both Russia and Ukraine, reported to have been involved in stealing USD 1.24 billion and laundering them using Bitcoin, Associated Press reported. More than a 100 financial institutions were targeted over a period of 5 years; the criminals managed to get away with as much as EUR 10 million in each heist. According to Interpol and Spanish police statements, the leader of the gang is an Ukrainian called “Denis K.” who was arrested along with three suspected accomplices from Russia and Ukraine in the Spanish city of Alicante.  The group would gain access to the affected banking networks by sending phishing emails with malicious attachments to bank officials. The malware would then let the gang members gain control over affected hardware, allowing them to break into ATMs and use the machines to withdraw unlimited sums of money. According to the authorities, although the attacks happened to financial institutions worldwide, almost all Russian banks were affected and about 50 of them did lose money in the attacks. The AP also reports that the criminals did not spend their ill-gained money, instead opting for changing it into bitcoin, which was then used for buying different assets, including real estate and vehicles in Spain. Back in February, the Thai police arrested Sergey Medvedev, said to be the number two person in an international cybercrime organization and administrator of the Dark Web site Infraud, who, at the time of arrest, was in possession of over 100,000 Bitcoins (USD 799 million)."

Each wallet is encrypted with a private key, consisting of letters and numbers, which are visually represented in his works. Buying a piece of his art does not mean that you own the private key, as anyone who figures out the code will be able to take the money for themselves. However, Bauch told Gizmodo that he will give the purchaser of any painting “a hint.” He added, “A lot of the work that I’m doing is trying to span this gap that often exists between new technology and humanity.” As of right now, all of the crypto appears to still be in each wallet, meaning that either no one has cracked any of the codes, or just not taken the money yet. Another visual puzzle, perhaps the best-known of them, was The Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto, a visual puzzle associated with the Bitcoin address 1FLAMEN6 that was created in 2015 with 5 BTC locked in. It was finally solved three years later, having previously been dubbed “fiendishly difficult”, by a programmer who hadn’t even heard of it until a month before finally cracking it. There are still more Bitcoin puzzles for aficionados to solve. For example, a tiny community on Reddit, with only 199 subscribers, offers a place for anyone who wants to share their puzzle with the world, or solve someone else’s. The challenges range from trivia games to scavenger hunts, with every title pointing out the difficulty level of the challenge and the reward. Another example is a video game called MonteCrypto: The Bitcoin Enigma, released in February. Described as “a maze filled with 24 mind-bending puzzles”, it promises one Bitcoin for the person who completes it first. It offers the possibility of working either alone or with others, as well as leading others to dead ends to slow them down. The Steam page of this game asks simply, “How much will players be willing to share, how much will they be able to compromise and who will claim access to the final vault of Montecrypto?” The game’s mysterious development team, Gem Rose Accent, hasn’t produced any other games, and they have said they wouldn’t reveal their identities until the prize is claimed. It would seem that the prize has either still not been claimed or simply not moved yet from the address. Whichever of these tickles your fancy, go for it - the possibilities are endless. Good luck!"
0," There were swing moves this past week in all major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Ethereum, bitcoin cash, ripple and litecoin. Prices recovered after heavy losses, but upsides remained capped which resulted in a fresh downtrend. Bitcoin and Ethereum are currently trading near important support levels. If they fail to recover today, there could be further declines this week.  Bitcoin
Bitcoin price failed to settle above the USD 9,000 level this past week and declined. Recently, BTC/USD even broke a crucial support at USD 8,500 and USD 8,400.
The pair is currently trading below the USD 8,400 support and it remains at a risk of more losses this week. Weekly supports are at USD 8,000 and USD 7,800. Below USD 7,800, the price may accelerate declines towards USD 7,200.
If there is a recovery back above the USD 8,500 level, the price could retest the USD 9,000 pivot level this week. Ethereum
Ethereum remained in a bearish zone this past week and is currently trading below the USD 540 support level. ETH/USD is flirting with the USD 500 support and it could decline further.
If sellers succeed in a daily close below USD 500, the price will most likely retest the last low near USD 450. Weekly resistance levels are at USD 530, USD 540 and USD 550. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash recovered this past week from the USD 850 support, but it could not hold gains above USD 1,000. BCH/USD opened this week below the USD 1,000 level and is currently down 2.6%. On the downside, important weekly supports are at USD 900 and USD 850.
Ripple’s struggle to recover continued this past week. There was a short-term recovery above USD 0.65 in XRP/USD, but the pair was not able to gain momentum and is currently down to USD 0.61. It may perhaps decline further towards the USD 0.55 this week. Other Altcoins Market Today
There were a few altcoins which posted gains today such as Ontology and Request Network. Ontology (ONT) performed better and rose by more than 25% to climb above USD 1.70.  Overall, the market sentiment is slightly bearish this week. If bitcoin price fails to hold the USD 8,000 support, there could be further increase in bearish pressure on BTC and altcoins."
0," Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and payment company Square, has spoken of his strong belief in the future potential of Bitcoin in an interview with The Times, published on Wednesday. Dorsey, who himself is a noted Bitcoin investor, thinks Bitcoin will overtake the dollar in importance as it becomes the single global currency of the internet within a decade. He was revealed as a funder of Lightning Labs, which specialises in a technology that can potentially make Bitcoin cheaper and faster to use. He helped raise around USD 2.5 million for the startup that promises scalability, low fees and faster transaction times in a bid for Bitcoin adoption. He does admit that Bitcoin “does not have the capabilities right now to become an effective currency,” due to scaling issues. But he does believe that, with new technologies and innovations, those problems will soon fade: “It’s slow and it’s costly, but as more and more people have it, those things go away. There are newer technologies that build off of blockchain and make it more approachable.” Dorsey has been a vocal supporter for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general for a while now. His payment company Square introduced Bitcoin trading earlier this year. He also said in a conference call with Market Watch, “Bitcoin, for us, is not stopping at buying and selling. We do believe that this is a transformational technology for our industry, and we want to learn as quickly as possible.” However, Twitter may prohibit advertisements for initial coin offerings (ICOs), token sales, and cryptocurrency wallets globally in two weeks, as previously reported. The company may also ban all ads for cryptocurrency exchanges, with some limited exceptions."
1," The cryptocurrency markets are in doldrums, and rating agencies are correlating them with different bubbles and scams that global markets had faced in the last few decades. Morgan Stanley strategist Sheena Shah sees enormous resemblances between the cryptocurrency market behavior and the dot-com bubble – the only exception being the 15 times higher growth in bitcoin price. Sheena Shah has based its prediction on following assumptions:  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Undoubtedly Morgan Stanley’s strategist is certainly right. Shah has outlined several key factors that are similar to the dot-com bubble. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are moving on speculation, and their trading volume continues declining with sideways movement. It’s also true that increasing trading volume doesn’t suggest higher trader interest; the higher volume could also be an indication of higher selling activities.   “Rising trade volumes are thus not an indication of more investor activity but instead a rush to get out,” Sheena Shah said. However, the strategist didn’t look at the price performance of NASDAQ after the dot-com bubble burst. NASDAQ recovered steadily at the beginning of 2003 following a two year of downward trends. NASDAQ currently stands around 7344 points, significantly higher from the 5000 points NASDAQ had hit during the peak of the dot-com bubble. In case of cryptocurrencies, it’s too early to predict the future price performance of bitcoin and other digital currencies. The market forces have refused to consider them as a medium of exchange and an alternative currency, and they have several valid reasons to support their denouncement – the lack of fair value is amongst the biggest reason for their criticisms.     Featured Image: Twitter "
1," Yesterday, a decent upward recovery was initiated in bitcoin, ether, ripple, bitcoin cash and other major cryptocurrencies. However, the mentioned recovery was capped as coins faced sellers near key resistance levels. The current technical structure is neutral to bearish until buyers succeed in pushing prices further higher. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price succeeded in settling above the USD 8,000 resistance. BTC/USD traded close to the USD 8,500 resistance, which acted as a key hurdle for more upsides. 
The pair is currently trading below the USD 8,500 resistance with a few negative signs. If buyers overcome selling pressure and succeeds in pushing the price above USD 8,500, there could be more gains toward USD 9,000.
On the other hand, a downside move may perhaps find support near USD 8,200 and USD 8,000. Ethereum
Ethereum could not gain strength above the USD 850 level, which resulted in a downside reaction. ETH/USD is currently trading 4.8% down to USD 518. 
An immediate support is at USD 500. If the pair fails to hold the stated USD 500 support, there could be an increase in selling pressure. The next important support is at USD 460. On the upside, the USD 540 and 550 levels remain key barriers for further recoveries. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is stable and is trading above the USD 940 and 950 support levels. BCH/USD has to move past the USD 1,000 resistance to gains strength. A failure to hold the USD 940 support may perhaps push the price toward USD 900.
Ripple is finally showing a few positive signs with a close above the USD 0.65 level. However, a break and close above the USD 0.70 and USD 0.75 resistance levels is must for further upsides. Other Altcoins Market Today
Qtum is doing well today and is currently trading above the USD 19.00 level. Recently, the Binance exchange added QTUM/USDT and QTUM/BNB trading pairs, which boosted the market sentiment. However, it is facing a significant resistance near USD 20.0. To sum up, it seems like the market recovered positively, but it could not maintain strength. If bitcoin price moves above USD 8,500 and ETH/USD breaks USD 850, the market may move into a bullish zone."
1," Analysts and market participants aren’t yet able to create the price prediction formula for cryptocurrencies; the market forces are divided on how these new assets will perform– some are calling for steady price growth, and others are seeing the price to fall to zero. Meanwhile, the idea of correlating cryptocurrencies with Giffen goods seems to be undoubtedly true. Giffen goods are products that people consume more when prices are higher, contrary to the demand and supply principle. Cryptocurrencies drive higher demand and interest when its price increases while the demand for digital currencies declines with the decay in prices. The demand for cryptocurrencies increased substantially in the final two months of last year when its price was soaring at a robust pace. However, regulators interference and harsh comments from market forces pulled back Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital currencies from their all-time high; the decline in prices has also lowered trader’s interest towards cryptocurrencies. Google trends show that searches for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies tanked by 80% to the lowest level in the last five months, while total confirm transactions are declining at a strong pace over the previous two months. Traders lost their confidence in cryptocurrencies after regulators, and key market players strongly criticized them on various grounds, including the lack of underlying value, failure to work as a medium of exchange and its uses in illegal activities. Followed by Facebook and Google, Twitter has also been planning to ban cryptocurrency related ads; they believe the unregulated cryptocurrency ads are harmful to consumers. >>Bitcoin Price Watch – Returns to $8,500 Bitcoin price regained momentum on Monday after hitting $7000 level on Sunday; the uptrend in price was supported by a statement from G20 Financial Stability Board chairman – who believe cryptocurrencies aren’t in a position to threaten the financial stability of the world. FBS members are likely to talk about digital currencies, but the chairman had ruled out the establishment of new regulatory policies for crypto markets during the summit.

1," On March 9, 2018, documents distributed at the tenth creditors’ meeting of the infamous exchange, Mt.Gox, went public. They revealed a series of multi-million dollar sales of Bitcoins.  According to the documents, its bankruptcy trustee, Mr. Nobuaki Kobayashi had claimed to be the author of those sales. The document with Kobayashi’s textual words read as follows: “Between the 9th creditors’ (September 27, 2017) meeting and this creditors’ meeting (On March 7, 2018), with the permission of the court, I sold a certain amount of BTC and bitcoin cash (“BCC”) that belonged to the bankruptcy estate. The quantities sold and the amount paid into the bankrupt trustee’s account are shown below.” The multi-million dollar sales coincided with the exact time that Bitcoin prices fell the most in recent months. According to a Reddit forum sales were made from a series of wallets traceable to Mt.Gox which resulted in, or happened curiously close to, the largest and most atypical bearish candles of the month.  However, while some consider the impact to be strong, other research says otherwise: According to Coin Telegraph there is no reason to become alarmists: “The data shows us that Kobayashi’s actions were not as significant to the price of Bitcoin in the short run as some individuals believed they were. That being said, the amount of cryptocurrency under Kobayashi’s management could have the ability to create a panic that causes investors to sell off their cryptocurrency – especially if they get a glimpse at a sell wall created by Kobayashi.”  After an intense debate, marked above all by Mr. Nobuaki’s secrecy, the silence was broken. In a document published on the Mt.Gox website known as Q&A regarding 10th Creditors’ Meeting Report, Mr. Nobuaki answers a series of questions relating to the sale of cryptocurrencies, with a special focus on his multi-million dollar sale of BTC and BCH. According to the report, the whale denies any responsibility for the fall in bitcoin prices, as it mentions that sales, in addition to being made separately and in quantities that did not cause sell walls, had other characteristics that would give a minimal impact to the price of bitcoin: He also mentions that his trade was not impulsive, but rather that he had expert advice on the subject (without specifying who these would be). Similarly, although the previous paragraph checks the cooperation with an Exchange, it should also be noted that the sales did not use this type of platform to be completed. He didn’t give any more details about these transactions: “Following consultation with cryptocurrency experts, I sold BTC and BCC, not by an ordinary sale through the BTC/BCC exchange, but in a manner that would avoid affecting the market price, while ensuring the security of the transaction to the extent possible. Therefore, I believe that the sale of BTC and BCC by us did not affect their market prices.” If his words are right, the bearish behavior may be natural, but he is already beginning to have critics who think that Mt Nobuaki is just defending himself. Fair practice that could give Holders peace of mind that their investment won’t fall as a result of some manipulation. In the end, everyone is free to make their interpretations, but the truth is that it now becomes easier to make an objective statement when one can know the trustee’s approach when negotiating.  "
1," This past week was mostly bearish since all major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Ethereum, bitcoin cash, ripple, litecoin, Neo and ADA declined sharply. However, the G20 Summit was a positive event for the crypto world as the Financial Stability Board (FSB) hinted that cryptocurrencies do not pose any threats to global financial stability at this moment. Prices recovered and most coins opened this week on a positive note. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price was under a lot of pressure this past week and every upward correction faced sellers. BTC/USD settled below the USD 9,000 pivot level and even declined toward USD 7,000.
A low was formed near USD 7,320 before a major upward correction was initiated. The price has recovered by roughly USD 800 and is currently trading 6.8% higher to USD 8,200.
Weekly supports on the downside are at USD 8,000 and USD 7,300. If the price fails to move past USD 8,500 and USD 9,000 resistance levels this week, it could resume its decline toward USD 7,300. Ethereum
Ethereum was one of the worst performers among the top five cryptocurrencies. It tumbled below the USD 620 and USD 500 support levels and traded toward USD 450.
Later, the market sentiment improved and ETH/USD started a decent recovery. It is currently trading above the USD 500 level with weekly resistances on the upside at USD 550 and USD 600. Above USD 600, the price may move back in a positive zone. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash was comparatively stable this past week, but buyers failed to contain losses below the USD 1,000 support. BCH/USD tested the USD 850 support before recovering. It is currently trading 3% higher to USD 925, with resistances at USD 950 and 1,000. 
Ripple tumbled and tested the USD 0.50 support zone. It is currently correcting higher with major resistances at USD 0.65 and USD 0.70. Weekly supports are at USD 0.55 and USD 0.50. Other Altcoins Market Today
Altcoins are staging a substantial recovery after a bearish past week. Many coins are in the green zone (Status, Electroneum, Nucleus Vision and QTUM) with gains between 25-30%. The best performer is Status (SNT) with 32% gains. Overall, this could be a crucial week for bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. If the current recovery gains traction, we could witness more upsides. Alternatively, bitcoin and Ethereum may perhaps resume downtrend."

1," No other asset across the globe has shown more volatility than cryptocurrencies. Crypto markets are substantially responsive to market reports, and they can add or wipe billions of dollars off the board in a single day alone – forcing Bitcoin (BTC) investors to keep an eye on the price charts several times a day to see where their investments stand. “With other speculative investments, like private equity and venture capital, you can’t check your phone every five minutes,” Jim Smigiel said. With cryptocurrencies, “you’re able to track the minute-by-minute value of it.” Bitcoin price lost close to $2000 since the start of this week following reports regarding increasing crackdown and advertisement related ban from Google.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies fell as low as $309 billion on Thursday, down significantly from $390 billion at the beginning of the week. The market capitalization currently hovers around 325 billion, down more than 60% from the value it hit at the beginning of the year. The price volatility extended on Friday; Bitcoin and the rest of top ten virtual currencies regained some momentum after hitting the one month low of $7,700 on Thursday. Though there wasn’t any supportive news for digital currencies, the prices are increasing on speculations that the price has found support below $8000. Though the market opinion is divided about the future of cryptocurrencies, some analysts believe BTC prices are likely to crash below the $6000 level after the corrective rally – they have based their opinion entirely on technical aspects of the BTC price chart. “When sentiment is this weak, the market is increasingly ’fire, ready, aim’ — meaning, any headline today is likely to trigger selling,” Fundstrat analysts including Tom Lee and Robert Sluymer wrote. Market dynamics are getting tougher for crypto markets following increasing concerns over the scams and illegal practices using cryptocurrencies. French regulatory authority has blacklisted 15 cryptocurrencies and crypto-asset websites. The Central bank of France has already denounced to accept cryptocurrencies and issued a warning to their citizens. Similarly, regulators from the U.S. and other major countries are implementing new rules – which could significantly slash trading volume in the days to come.

1," Thursday, March 15th will go down in history as the day Lightning Network’s software lnd 0.4-beta version rolled out for the very first time. What does it mean? And is it already for everyone? Bitcoin has seen its share of problems throughout its relatively brief history, but mostly in the way it was simply not viable as an actual currency due to its high transaction fees and long confirmation times.  Lightning Network worked tirelessly to change that. The idea is that transacting and settling would be done off-blockchain, so the fees are low and thanks to the implementation of smart contracts for security, the payments can be instant - no waiting time for block confirmation. Other than these two, another important factor is its scalability, which is supposed to make it possible for millions to billions of transactions per second to take place across the network.  The beta release now makes available what investors and project leads say is the first thoroughly tested version of the tech to date. This now means that users can leverage lnd to send and receive Bitcoin and Litecoin off-blockchain.  Not for everyone “Bitcoin enthusiasts have gotten excited about this, merchants are excited about this. It feels like we’re right on the edge of mass cryptocurrency adoption,” Elizabeth Stark, Lightning Labs CEO, told Bloomberg.  However, she urges caution because a beta is far from a finished product. “This is still an early beta version aimed at developers and advanced users. As with any early software there will still be bugs. Users shouldn't be putting more money on Lightning right now than they are willing to lose,” Stark told Bitcoin Magazine. The target demographic for the release is developers and ""advanced users"" who are able to run a full node and use lnd’s command-line interface. The safety measures for the beta include limitations of how much people can send: this is now capped at around USD 1,400 worth per channel, or around USD 400 per payment. Spirits are high and excitement for reaching this milestone is not showing signs of retreating in the too-near future. Ben Davenport, CTO at BitGo and Lightning Network's investor, said to Coindesk, “It's something the entire community has been focused on and working towards for the better part of two years now. It's really the culmination of a lot of work by many people, not just Lightning Labs. ... We see it as a very important piece of the scaling solution for Bitcoin, and perhaps other digital currencies as well.” It was also revealed that Lightning Labs has raised USD 2.5 million from nearly a dozen investors, many of them big names in the industry such as Litecoin creator Charlie Lee; BitGo CTO Ben Davenport; Square and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey; former PayPal COO and Yammer founder David Sacks; Tesla and SpaceX angel investor Bill Lee; head of Square Capital and Square’s People Lead Jacqueline Reses; Eventbrite co-founder Kevin Hartz; Robinhood co-founder Vlad Tenev; and The Hive, Digital Currency Group and others. Lightning Network is not the only one working on ways to make Bitcoin more accessible as a payment system. SegWit, short for Segregated Witness, is also gaining traction as the number of transactions using it doubled to more than 30% of the total in the past month. Bitcoin transaction fees have plummeted in part thanks to this, but the total number of transactions has also declined. Both lnd and SegWit may become the main reasons for all-time lows in terms of fees, other than leading the crypto industry into a whole new era."
1," Yesterday’s decline in bitcoin price found support at USD 7,500. The price recovered by more than USD 500, but it seems like buyers are lacking momentum. Similarly, there was a decent recovery in all major altcoins such as ethereum, bitcoin cash and ripple. However, they seem to be facing many resistances on the upside, which are capping further recoveries. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price started an upward correction from the USD 7,650 low. BTC/USD broke the USD 8,000 resistance and traded towards the USD 8,400 level. The stated USD 8,400 level was a support earlier and this time it prevented the current upside move.
The pair retreated and is currently trading around 0.8% down to USD 8,100. An initial support on the downside is at USD 8,000. If the price fails to stay above USD 8,000, there could a retest of the last low of USD 7,650.
On the upside, the price has to move past the USD 8,400 and USD 8,500 resistance levels to recover further. Ethereum
Ethereum recovered from the USD 570 low, but it is struggling a great deal to stay above the USD 600-610 zone. ETH/USD traded as high as USD 621 and is currently down 2.1% to USD 595.
If the price has to recover towards USD 700, it must surpass the USD 625 and USD 630 resistance levels. On the downside, the last low near USD 570 is a short-term support followed by USD 560. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is under pressure since it failed to break the USD 950 resistance. BCH/USD is down 3.3% to USD 903 and it may continue to move down if it fails to stay above USD 900.
Ripple recovered a few points and moved above USD 0.70. However, the XRP/USD pair could not hold gains above USD 0.70 and is currently trading down 1.7% to USD 0.691. It may continue to decline towards the USD 0.68 level. Other Altcoins Market Today
Nexus coin did well today so far as the NXS price registered more than 20% gains to move above USD 2.15. A few other coins such as Aion, Dentacoin, DigixDAO and Lisk also did well and posted between 14-20% gains. Overall, the current market sentiment is still bearish. In order to start a fresh upside move, bitcoin price must move past the USD 8,500 resistance."
1," Despite the cryptocurrency market taking a serious beating the past few months, the U.K has just announced some big news. Coinfloor, a London-based cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it would be starting its own bitcoin futures exchanged named CoinfloorEX. This new exchange will offer bitcoin futures “at scale” through their own specific contracts and operational controls. The futures contracts are available to traders, hedge funds, and miners. CoinfloorEX claims they will offer the first “physically delivered cryptocurrency futures contracts”, designed specifically to protect investors from price slippage on positions at the time of settlement. The settlements made by CoinfloorEX will be based on physical delivery rather than the index price that’s across all other exchanges, which in turn provides true pricing transparency. >> Day One of Crypto Madness The company goes into further details in the official statement saying: “Access to Coinfloor’s spot exchange enables investors to easily convert Bitcoin to Fiat currency post-physical delivery, creating opportunities for longer-term currency appreciation or through meeting Bitcoin-denominated obligations.” The development team behind this project is taking security as a top priority, which is necessary given the number of hacks that have occurred as of late. The security of the exchange is underscored by a 100 percent multi-signature cold storage cryptocurrency custody facility. This aims at completely safeguarding client portfolios from theft and other security issues that occur when storage assets are held partially or fully online. An additional feature they are adding monthly audits of the Bitcoin balances, which gives ease to the investors to assure CoinfloorEX has enough Bitcoin liquidity to manage the high market fluctuations. These futures will be launching sometime next month, despite the downward price of Bitcoin currently. Will the announcement and spread of the news, help drive up the price of Bitcoin like it did when the U.S announced their futures? Whatever happens, this is still great news for the cryptocurrency market, despite its recent slaughtering due to Google banning crypto relative ads. Featured Image: Krypto"
1," Yesterday, Google officially announced it is banning all ads related to cryptocurrencies starting June 2018. This greatly impacted the market since bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, ripple and almost all cryptocurrencies declined sharply. The market sentiment turned bearish and prices moved into a bearish region. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price tumbled and broke a couple of important support levels such as USD 9,000 and USD 8,600. The decline in BTC/USD was nasty as the pair even surpassed the USD 8,000 level.
The pair traded as low as USD 7,650 and it is currently down 9.2% to USD 8,180. It seems like the price is in a recovery mode, but it could face resistances on the upside such as USD 8,400 and USD 8,500.
Above USD 8,500, the broken supports at USD 8,800 and USD 9,000 are major barriers. On the downside, a decent support is forming around USD 8,000. If the price breaks down below USD 8,000, it could retest the recent low of USD 7,650. Ethereum
Ethereum declined heavily and broke the USD 650 and 600 support levels. The ETH/USD pair traded as low as USD 570 and it is currently correcting higher.
The pair is still trading 11% lower from the USD 687 high. Supports on the downside are seen as USD 600 and USD 570, and resistance are at USD 640 and 650. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is now trading well below the USD 1,000 support. BCH/USD traded towards the USD 850 support, recovered and is currently down 11% to USD 930.
Ripple extended declines and traded below the USD 0.65 support. XRP/USD seems to be under a lot of pressure and it could even test the USD 0.60 support level. Resistances are at USD 0.70 and USD 0.75. Other Altcoins Market Today
All other altcoins are under selling pressure and following the current slide. However, it seems like there is a short-term support base forming, considering the oversold levels. In order to recover substantially, bitcoin price must hold the USD 8,000 support. If BTC/USD fails to stay above the mentioned support, there are chances of further downsides toward USD 7500 and USD 7200. On the flip side, a break above the USD 8,500 resistance may perhaps improve the market sentiment."
0," There was no substantial move in major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin cash and Litecoin. It seems like prices are consolidating above key support levels. On the other hand, a few low market cap coins were able to attract investors and traded higher. Bitcoin
The past three sessions were mostly quiet since bitcoin price traded in a tiny range and did not make an upside move above USD 9,500 resistance. 
On the positive note, there was no downside break below the USD 9,000 and USD 8,800 support levels. As long as the pair is above the stated USD 8,800 support, it could slowly rise to USD 9,500.
Above USD 9,500, the USD 9,600 is a key resistance on the way to USD 10,000. On the flip side, a break below the USD 8,800 support may perhaps kick start a fresh downside wave towards USD 8,200. Ethereum
Ethereum seems to be struggling and it is currently trading below the USD 700 support. The current price action in ETH/USD points an increase in selling pressure from the USD 705-710 resistance region.
If the pair fails to stay above an important support at USD 680, there can be a sharp downside move. A recovery could start if ETH buyers succeed in pushing the price back above the USD 710 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is trading slightly higher towards USD 1,050 and is currently gaining 1%. On the downside, the USD 1,020 support is acting as a major buy zone. To the topside, the USD 1,050 and 1,080 are key resistances.
Ripple remained below the USD 0.80 pivot level. It seems like the XRP/USD is consolidating below USD 0.80, and it is preparing for the next major move. Other Altcoins Market Today
Binance Coin (BNB) rose sharply today and gained more than 25%. BNB price traded above the USD 10 resistance, which is a positive sign. The main driving force behind the current rally was ‘Binance Chain’ announcement by the company. “As a public blockchain, Binance Chain will mainly focus on the transfer and trading of blockchain assets, as well as provide new possibilities for the future flow of blockchain assets,” according to Binance. Overall, the current market sentiment is neutral to bearish. Bitcoin price must stay above the USD 9,000 and 8,800 support levels to avoid further losses."
1," The anti-virus software pioneer John McAfee has presented bullish assumptions in favor of Bitcoin price (BTC) – John McAfee thinks BTC could hit $1 million level by 2020. Though the anti-virus software pioneer had several reasons to support his bet, he also suggests investors invest only the money they can afford to lose – which signifies that he isn’t too confident in its price prediction strategy. John has based its price target estimate on four key factors: He further believes BTC price to increase at the rate of 0.4840957034310259% per day to attain the price target of $1 million. John McAfee assumes the price will rise daily at this rate, and calculating a compounded rate for the remaining number of days until December 31, 2020. While John has highlighted several relevant facts that could support the price, he has neglected regulators role in crypto markets along with several other aspects, such as underlying value, criticism on its usage from criminals and the adaptation as an alternative currency.   Regulators will play a key role in settling the price for cryptocurrencies; they are taking steps that could wipe off billions of dollars from crypto markets. Based on research reports, criminals are accounting for almost half of the trading volume – which is at risk following regulators strategy to play a meddler role. Major players had rejected to adopt currencies due to its lack of underlying value; they consider digital currencies as speculative investments. Bitcoin, Ripple and other cryptocurrencies aren’t backed by real cash assets such as gold or foreign exchange; these coins mined through specific techniques and distributed to the general public. The market opinion is divided on the behavior of digital currencies and the time will tell how accurate John was in creating bullish bet. Featured Image: Twitter"
1," The recent Mt. Gox dump by Nobuaki Kobayashi, a Tokyo attorney and bankruptcy trustee for Mt Gox, is what some people believe brought the cryptocurrency market down recently - and he’s not even done yet. Kobayashi reportedly has another USD 1.9 billion to offload. But the next court hearing for the Mt. Gox bankruptcy is scheduled for September 18th, 2018, so it is likely that the attorney will not be able to get rid of the remaining coins until then - which could be a good thing for the Bitcoin price. Disclosures in Kobayashi's report on the Mt. Gox website suggest his Bitcoin sales since September fetched the equivalent of USD 10,105 on average. But the part that’s got everyone red-faced with rage is when Bitcoin investor Alistair Milne pointed out on Twitter that over half of the Bitcoin the attorney sold was transferred to an exchange on February 5. It was the day before Bitcoin hit a three-month low of close to USD 6,000 - so traders are concerned that he was effectively the one who brought it down. Exactly how unhappy users were with this situation is best seen on social media. People were venting on Reddit, with ideas what could have been done instead - like auctioning bitcoin off like it is often done in these cases, or release the same number of coins every day at a rate the market can absorb. In other threads, the top comments were on par with, “Just give the people their money in BTC and let them decide what to do with it. This is horsesh*t.” Any proceeds left after Mt. Gox's creditors are paid will go to Mark Karpeles, the founder of the infamous bitcoin exchange. This is another issue for the community, as it believes that Karpeles, facing charges of embezzlement and data manipulation and currently on bail from prison, should not reap any benefits from Mt. Gox’s fall. However, Chuck Jones, a contributor at Forbes, argues that blaming the Mt. Gox offload for the recent price drops makes no sense, saying that it seems “highly unlikely that this selling would have had much impact on the market.” He says that, “Since the sales were spread out over more than a month and at most represented 1.2% of a days trading volume, I find it hard to believe that Mt Gox created the decline in Bitcoin’s price.” He further added that the reason for the price drops could have been Bitcoin’s price “getting ahead of itself” or the fact that some countries went against crypto, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission coming out with statements in January. In short - his opinion is that everything except for this offload is the reason for the price drop. Meanwhile, Jim Edwards, an editor-in-chief of Business Insider UK, agrees: “That anger is misplaced, however. All they are complaining about is the fundamental condition of Bitcoin itself. They are complaining about the clearing price of supply and demand. They are ridiculous.” The truth, however, may just be in the middle of these warring opinions. Rare are the instances where there is a single, obvious reason for price fluctuations. It is usually a combination of common themes, such as public perception, panic selling and security breaches. In this case, it is highly unlikely that Mt Gox was the sole reason for the price drop - but arguing that it did not contribute to it doesn’t seem quite right either."
1," The crypto community never ceases to amaze with the number of ways they can find to laugh at Bitcoin Cash. Exactly why we’re mocking them this time remains unknown, but the Lil Windex song may have seemed proof that BCH is as much a joke as its theme song. So the newest topic is the claim that it has less transactions than Dogecoin. Twitter user @Whalepool points this out in a controversial tweet. Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency introduced as a “joke currency” to prove people would buy anything. While there are few mainstream commercial applications, it has gained traction as an Internet tipping system, in which social media users grant Dogecoin tips to other users for providing interesting or noteworthy content. Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, has been called the “real Bitcoin” by its endorsers in the community, being the result of a prolonged disagreement on how to handle the Bitcoin scalability problem. Bitcoin Cash fans argue that it is superior to the original Bitcoin because of its greater transaction speed, thus more likely to be used by merchants and for transactions. This has been dubbed the crypto “civil war”, where both sides claim that “this is what Satoshi would have wanted!”, despite nobody really knowing anything about Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. Their superiority doesn’t really show right now. The numbers at Bitinfocharts.com do not lie: in the past two months, only rarely did the number of Bitcoin Cash transactions exceed that of Dogecoin transactions, and the two cannot even compete with Litecoin most of the time. But before that, BCH traded at five times the number of Dogecoin transactions - a number that cannot be overseen, as the graph in the tweet was heavily taken out of full context. This could arguably be because Bitcoin Cash is significantly younger than the two - but its merit in transaction speed may be lost on traders as they obviously go for even the jokester’s Dogecoin more often than BCH. How Bitcoin’s “younger brother” will mark its comeback remains to be seen, as well as whether it will ever get out of its older brother’s shadow."
1," There was a downside correction initiated in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin cash and other major cryptocurrencies. Prices are down roughly 4.6% and are showing a few negative signs. It seems like there could be an extended downside correction before prices start an upward move. Bitcoin
Yesterday, bitcoin price failed to move above the USD 9,800 and 10,000 resistance levels. As a result, the BTC/USD pair started a downward move and trade below the USD 9,500 and 9,200 support levels.
It even traded below USD 9,000, but later recovered and is currently trading around 5.8% lower to USD 9,240. On the upside, the broken support levels at USD 9,300 and 9,500 may perhaps as resistances.
On the downside, the USD 9,000 level remains a major support. If the price closes below USD 9,000, there could be more declines towards USD 8,500. Ethereum
Ethereum was under pressure as it struggled to hold the USD 720 support. It declined and is currently finding it difficult to remain above the USD 700 support.
ETH/USD is trading 4.5% lower to USD 703. It may trade in a range above USD 675 for a few hours before it makes the next move. Below USD 700, the price may trade back towards USD 675. On the upside, a break above USD 725 is needed for a push towards USD 750. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash struggled a lot and declined 6.5% to USD 1,035. It failed not hold gains above the USD 1,100 and 1,080 supports and declined. Going forward, BCH/USD has to stay above USD 1,000 to avoid further losses.
Ripple’s bad run continues as it could not move above the USD 0.85 level. XRP/USD is currently down 4.4% to USD 0.79. It must move above USD 0.82 and USD 0.85 to start a fresh upside move. Other Altcoins Market Today
NEM cryptocurrency did very well today and gained around 20.8% to trade above the USD 0.40 resistance. It is currently trading near USD 0.44, with the next resistance at USD 0.50. There were a few positive developments from the NEM community and developers, which lifted the market sentiment. To sum up, the current market sentiment is slightly bearish. However, if bitcoin price stays above USD 9,000, there could be a fresh upward wave."
0," Cryptocurrency trading is an emerging market that has been growing and capitalizing at a breakneck pace, but it has atypical behavior when compared to traditional markets. It is not uncommon for currency traders to use adopted ForEx market indicators such as MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Indicators or Fibonacci’s Retracements, but the truth is that many of these methodologies were created for traditional markets and may not be entirely right for crypto-trading. This has led many economists and “old-school” investors to see investments in cryptocurrencies more as a gamble rather than a real capital investment.  However, this seems to be changing, with the emergence of specialized studies, which have led to improved trading strategies. One that has emerged recently in blogs and news sites is the one created by the well-known Bitcoin Strategist and strong bullish investor Thomas Lee: the Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI) Although the methodology applied or the mathematical formula for its determination has not been disclosed, the indicator seeks to explain the market’s feeling regarding bitcoins ownership and how motivated a person would be to sell what he has. According to MarketWatch: “The Bitcoin Misery Index is a measure of consistency in the price of the No. 1 digital asset, bitcoin BTCUSD, +7.07% over the past 90 days, using the end of day performance (up-day or down-day) and volatility. In other words, it is a measure of momentum in the asset, equivalent to an oversold-overbought indicator. Market technicians often gauge “overbought” or “oversold” conditions based on measures of price momentum.” The results are given on a scale of 0 – 100, where 0 is “absolutely miserable” (bitcoin holders are “absolutely” willing to give away all their bitcoin) and 100 is “absolutely happy” (where no price in the world would be enough to motivate bitcoin holders to sell their coins). Of course in economics, the “absolute” signs indicators do not exist, but it’s easy to conclude that in general terms, Tom Lee developed an indicator, which analyzes the behavior and characteristics of the bitcoin to produce a more accurate result than other similar indexes. The indicator created by FondStrat’s owner shows a negative result. That is to say, the lower the number, the bigger the misery /, The bigger the number, the lower the misery)  In the world of trading there are already other similar indicators such as the RSI (Relative Strength Index) which, as stated by Investopedia “compares the magnitude of recent gains and losses over a specified time period to measure speed and change of price movements of a security” , and the MACD which is “a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of prices”. Investors often use these indicators in an attempt to find areas where trend shifts allow them to raise money, either by buying cheaply and then selling expensive in front of a bullish trend or by selling at the start of a bearish trend to buy more goods with the same amount of money. “When the bitcoin misery index is at’ misery’ (below 27), bitcoin sees the best 12-month performance,” Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Thomas Lee said in an interview with CNBC “A signal is generated about every year.” Right now the indicator has a result of 18.8, its lowest since Sept. 6, 2011. And according to an interview with Thomas Lee,“The last four times this was below 27… there was not a single instance with bitcoin not up 12 months later.”  When comparing the results with the traditional indicators, you can see that right now is an excellent time to invest in Bitcoins. All signs point to the same results. After the price manipulation resulting from an atypical selling of 400 Million Dollars by Mt. Gox Bankruptcy Trustee, Mr. Nobuaki Kobayashi, prices should return to their natural behavior.  According to a report published by Forbes “Lee’s Bitcoin Misery Index may be more useful than the traditional RSI and MACD indicators for Bitcoin since he has compiled some additional information to go along with his analysis. Also, Bitcoin’s price was relatively low until 2017, so RSI and MACD may not have enough historical data to be as accurate vs. when they are applied to securities having a longer track record. That being said both the RSI, the top portion of the graph below, and the MACD, the bottom portion, indicate that Bitcoin is in a bit of an oversold condition.”  >>Mt.Gox Bankruptcy Trustee sells $400million USD in BTC; Causes Market To Drop Almost 40% So remember: “Do not invest more than you can afford to lose” but in case you do have money to invest, check out the Bitcoin Misery Index and take advantage of the ‘misery’ of bitcoin holders now and (very likely) profit by the end of the year.

0," This past week, we saw a major decline in almost all major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin cash, Litecoin and Neo. Later, the market stabilized and started recovering. Bitcoin corrected higher after forming a base above USD 8,400. Similarly, altcoins recovered sharply as the market sentiment improved during the past few hours. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently trading 13.8% higher from the USD 8,532 low. More importantly, the BTC/USD pair is now trading above the USD 9,500 support, which could ignite more upsides.
On the upside, the price is facing an immediate resistance at USD 10,000. A push above the mentioned resistance may perhaps boost the bullish market sentiment and the price could trade towards USD 10,500. 
On the downside, the USD 9,500 level is a major support. A break below USD 9,500 will most likely push the price back towards USD 9,000. Ethereum
Ethereum gained traction after forming a base above the USD 650 level. ETH/USD recovered and traded above the USD 700 resistance. It is currently up 7.8% to USD 738. 
It seems to be struggling to break the USD 750 resistance. A break above the USD 750 level may call for further gains towards the USD 800 level. On the downside, supports are at USD 700 and 680. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash was one of the best performers as it recovered by around 14% today and it is currently trading at USD 1,130. It has to clear a strong resistance at USD 1,150 to continue its recovery.
Ripple failed to capitalize and it seems to be struggling to move past USD 0.85. XRP/USD is currently trading around 3.8% higher to USD 0.829 and is facing a major resistance at USD 0.85. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, IOStoken,  a decentralized internet of services platform, gained heavy bids and surged by around 22.6%. IOST price broke the USD 0.020 resistance and is currently trading in a positive zone. There was no particular reason for the recent jump, but one person on reddit reported that there were some false posts regarding McDonald’s and Amazon, which were removed later.
Overall, the current market sentiment is positive and it seems like there may be more upsides in the near term, especially if bitcoin price moves past the USD 10,000 resistance."
0," Those who have been into crypto trading for some time must already be familiar with the constant fluctuation in token prices. The price variation of Bitcoin in the last three months alone is a virtual roller coaster; the price was $8k in November, 20k in December (19898.8$ to be more accurate) but then back to $9k in January. Such level of risk has generated a universal mantra in the community: “Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose”. However, since the crypto market is still a growing niche, with a constant number of new adopters every day, it is still difficult to make predictions although for now, the future looks promising. It is precisely this accelerated growth that has made it possible for so many people to make a profit uncomparable with any other investment. Some early adopters have even become millionaires without doing absolutely nothing more than waiting (or HODL). These people who for one reason or another have large amounts of money (or some token as the case may be) are known as “whales” and have the power to manipulate the market. Have you ever tried to buy a token and come across a “wall” that prevents you from buying it at a reasonable price because someone has placed an enormous purchase order for a price lower than yours?…  Did you see the order magically vanishing shortly afterward? This is known as a buy/sell wall. Equally, the actions taken by these whales affect traders globally, since when they sell or buy orders as a result of their massive operations, prices can skyrocket or plummet in a matter of minutes. In February someone bought almost 400 Million in Bitcoin, generating an increase of nearly 50% in its overall price.  His operations stored on an address which today has more than 92000 Bitcoins, had a positive result for the WHOLE market, thanks to a rebound in the price trend. On March 6, 2018, the Bitcoin reached a historic low, touching the $6000 mark. No one knew the apparent reason, but with the publication of an official report by Mr. Nobuaki Kobayashi, Bankruptcy Trustee of the now-defunct Mt. Gox, clear explanation arose for those who could make the figures: “Between the 9th creditors’ (September 27, 2017) meeting and this creditors’ meeting (On March 7, 2018), with the permission of the court, I sold a certain amount of BTC and bitcoin cash (“BCC”) that belonged to the bankruptcy estate. The quantities sold and the amount paid into the bankrupt trustee’s account are shown below” These operations totaled approximately U. S. 402,797975 million dollars according to the Google Exchange Rate of 1 Japanese yen = 0.00937 U.S. dollars The report concludes with a few words that explain the speculative behavior of every trader and the influence that a whale can have on the markets. “I made efforts to sell BTC and BCC at as high a price as possible in light of the market price of BTC and BCC at the time of the sale.” A Reddit user was able to track the movements made with the conclusion that the selling was not “gradual” but very quick instead. This led to an abrupt drop in Bitcoin prices that were reflected in a bearish trend for most of the other altcoins. Twitter user Matt Odell correlated the movements with bitcoin behavior. Results speak for themselves.  However, we have to wait. The crypto trading system must be taken very objectively in order not to make hasty decisions. Weak-handers usually lose, this is something to take into consideration after identifying three critical points of Mr. Nobuaki’s report: 1) Nobuaki Kobayashi’s power of decision and resource management “Unless the court makes a new decision, the bankruptcy proceedings will proceed as before, and I, as the bankruptcy trustee, continue to have the right to administer and dispose of the bankruptcy estate as before.” 2) The number of resources he manages. If with 35000 BTC an adverse reaction was generated, it is essential to be aware that he has the resources to do it again, producing more significant results. “The amount of BTC managed by the bankruptcy estate as of March 5, 2018, is 166,344.35827254 BTC… The amount of BCC managed by the bankruptcy estate as of March 5, 2018, is 168,177.35927254 BCC.”  3) The expressed willingness to do so again when deemed appropriate “I plan to consult with the court and determine further sale of BTC and BCC.” >>Ripple CEO: Cryptocurrencies Must Work With Government Regulations So far there has not been an official statement from Mr. Nobuaki Kobayashi or the courts of law, but social networks have been on fire since the information came out. Mainly because there is a conflict of interest between the users of the platform and Kobayashi as Mt.Gox representative since the number of bitcoins and altcoins that the users deposited in the exchange house have revalued a lot after Mt.Gox initiated the bankruptcy legal proceeding. Therefore, they expect to be reimbursed for their investment in cryptocurrency and not in FIAT money as Mr. Nobuaki’s strategy seems to pretend.  Featured Image: Twitter"
0," Out of all the rappers named after cleaning products, Lil Windex is perhaps the most successful one. The inscrutable rapper is believed to hail from British Columbia, although very little is truly known about him, other than that he once said, “I idolize birds.” He is the one to thank for the Bitcoin Ca$h song that seems to have the makings of a viral hit, if only because of how strange it is. Over three verses, Bitcoin Ca$h tells the story of a young Lil Windex, probably fictionalized, who goes from a dead-end job cleaning windows, to being hard-sold by a guy in a cafe who explains the details (and we mean absolute details!) of crypto mining, to obtaining ludicrous personal wealth. Since showing his crypto stash off would not look too great in a music video, he is throwing around fiat currency, we’re guessing after he cashed his BCH out. His portfolio remains a mystery, but he does take a hard stance on Bitcoin core - the BCH community’s nickname for the original Bitcoin - saying that, “Hey f*ck Bitcoin core. You’re just a buncha names. We the BCH gang. We run this game.” The only thing that’s telling us is that he certainly doesn’t own any BTC. If you’re wondering whether it’s a joke or serious, or was it sponsored by BCH supporters - we don’t know either. Nobody does, and we’re not even sure Lil Windex knows. Take it as you will - serious or not, you’ll probably find yourself humming it throughout the day. You wouldn’t be the only one."
0," Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin cash, Litecoin, Neo and all other major altcoins tumbled during the past few sessions. There was hardly any recovery in the market following yesterday’s decline. At present, sellers are still in control and there are no signs of a short-term recovery. The current move is mostly a technical breakdown, which could extend in the near term. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is about to register one of the worst weeks of 2018. It is down around 25% this week and it recently broke a couple of important support levels such as USD 10,000 and 9,000.
BTC/USD pair is currently down 13.5% to USD 8,643. Today’s low was USD 8,329 and the current correction wave is struggling to gain momentum. It seems like the price may resume its downside in the near term and it could even break the recent low of USD 8,329.
On the downside, the next major support is at USD 8,000. On the upside, resistances are at USD 8,880 and 9,000. Ethereum
Ethereum followed bitcoin and declined sharply below the USD 650 level. ETH/USD traded towards USD 640 before starting a recovery. The pair is currently losing 12.7% and is struggling near the USD 666 level.
On the downside supports are at USD 650 and 640. A break below the USD 640 support may perhaps push the price towards the USD 600 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash traded close to the USD 900 level and is currently trading well below the USD 1,000 level. BCH/USD declined 13.2% to USD 956. It remains in a bearish zone as long as it is below USD 1,000.
Ripple tumbled and moved below the USD 0.80 level. XRP/USD’s struggle to move higher continues and the current market decline has increased bearish pressures. Other Altcoins Market Today
No cryptocurrency registered gains today. All altcoins are trading in the red zone and they remain at a risk of more losses.
The current market sentiment is very bearish, but at the same time, the market is near extreme oversold levels. Therefore, there could be a pullback, but it may be limited."
0," Bitcoin and almost all altcoins saw an increase in selling pressure during the past few sessions. The main reason was phishing and attempted stealing incident on a major cryptocurrency exchange – Binance. However, the exchange released a statement mentioning that all funds are safe. Later, the company resumed withdrawals as well.   Bitcoin
Bitcoin price dropped heavily and broke a major support area at USD 10,000. It even surpassed the USD 9,600 support and traded towards the USD 9,400 level. 
Later, the market calmed down and BTC/USD recovered. However, the pair is still down around 5.3% to USD 9,920. It has to move back above the USD 10,000 level to recover further.
If the pair fails to move above USD 10,000, it could retest the USD 9,600 support. On the upside, above USD 10,000, the price may perhaps move towards USD 10,500. Ethereum
Ethereum traded sharply lower and broke the USD 750 support. It traded close to the USD 700 level before starting an upside correction.
ETH/USD is currently trading 3.4% down to USD 758. It may continue to move higher, but it will most likely find a strong selling interest near a major resistance at USD 800 (previous support). On the downside, the USD 740 and 720 levels are decent supports. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash fell below the USD 1,110 support and traded towards USD 1,030. However, BCH/USD also recovered recently like bitcoin, and it is currently down 5.1% to USD 1,090. It must settle back above USD 1,110 to start a fresh upside wave.
Ripple remained in a bearish zone and it settled below USD 0.90. XRP/USD could resume it downside in the short term towards the USD 0.80 and 0.75 levels. Other Altcoins Market Today
There was hardly any major mover today so far. The only coin in the green zone is NEM, a smart asset blockchain. XEM price is currently trading around 9.4% higher and is placed above the USD 0.3250 resistance. To sum up, Binance phishing and attempted stealing incident sparked heavy selling. However, the market is now stable, but damage is already done. It will take a lot of strength from bitcoin buyers to push the price back in the green zone."
0," Bitcoin investors should be careful; Bitcoin price (BTC) continues to make the sideways movement as the global investment communities are still unsure about the future of cryptocurrencies. The debate for its utilization as an alternative currency and medium of exchange has been going on for years. Bitcoin price was hammered from the $20,000 mark at the beginning of the year to only $6,000. This was after intellectuals, regulators and global leaders stressed on the need for regulating cryptocurrencies during the World Economic Forum.  Regulators and senior market analysts have turned significantly bearish on digital currencies. They don’t appreciate investments in bitcoin and other digital currencies – indeed they are predicting an instant crash and massive risk of losing the investment. Bitcoin’s trading volume has decreased substantially in the last few weeks following bearish comments from key players. The reports show that bitcoin transactions dropped to the lowest level in two years, while Google trends-data indicated a drop of 80% in searches for bitcoin. The U.K Prime Minister Theresa May had promised to carefully look at bitcoin and other digital currencies to avoid the illegal movement of wealth. The regulators from U.K. aren’t sending positive signals, suggesting strict regulatory actions from the one of the significant cryptocurrency market. While Bangladesh, India, China and several other countries have already banned cryptocurrency trading, amid the threat of money laundering and tax evasion – poor response from European and British regulators poses a risk for the possible crash in prices. Bitcoin investors should now take steps to protect their investment from risks that could result in complete losses, the Bank of England’s Chief Economist has warned. >>Apple Co-Founder Falls Victim To Bitcoin Scam Followed by harsh remarks from the Bank of England’s governor, the Chief Economist Andy Haldane warned for the immediate price crash. He said: “There are lots of potential risks there. One of which is the danger to the consumer from buying into this stuff. If you want to invest in bitcoin, be prepared to lose all your money. That would be my serious warning.”   Featured Image: Twitter"
0," This week didn’t start off on the high for Bitcoin price (BTC) and its future fundamentals; BTC price is steadily moving downhill after hitting $11,500 during the weekend and in early trading on Monday. The downward trend was due to lower volume – which is a frustrating sign for bulls. Bitcoin prices lost close to $1,000 from its Monday high, the price of bitcoin token was around $10,594 today. It seems that bulls are losing their grip on the crypto markets after the ruthless response from major regulators of European countries and the United Kingdom. The entire crypto market has been under pressure over the last three days – Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and the rest of top ten digital currencies are declining at a mid-single-digit rate. Ethereum moves back below the $800 mark for the first time in the last fifteen days, while Ripple trades at around $0.90. Trading volume always has substantial importance in settling the price whether its stock market or crypto market. Lower trading volume signifies declining trader’s confidence – which could have the negative impact on the price performance.   Bitcoin has been experiencing a significant drop in trading volume and confirmed transactions over the last couple of weeks. The total confirmed transactions declined to the two year low of 180,000 on Feb 26.     Bitcoin Google search trends are falling at a tremendous rate suggesting a declining interest for cryptocurrencies. Google trend data indicated a drop of 80% in searches for bitcoin to the lowest level in last five months. While the global markets and financial world has widely accepted blockchain technologies, they aren’t accepting the cryptocurrency phenomena as an alternative currency – and they have several factual reasons for their denouncement. Regulators and business magnates are continually hammering trader’s sentiments by sending warning signals; the majority of them criticizing digital currencies due to its volatile nature, underlying value and its use for illegal purposes. The former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Rogoff believes bitcoin isn’t worth more than $100 in his view, saying: “I think Bitcoin will be worth a tiny fraction of what it is now if we’re headed out 10 years from now… I would see $100 as being a lot more likely than $100,000.” Featured Image: Depositphotos/© gustavofrazao"
0," Having seen the prices go close to USD 20,000 and back down again, many have decided that Bitcoin mining may be a more lucrative business than trading. However, mining is expensive and as more people set up rigs and more coins are mined, it only gets harder and pricier. Exactly how pricy, EliteFixtures.com found out by doing a worldwide study. The subsidiary of Crescent Electric Supply Company, an American distributor of electrical hardware, looked at the cost to mine one Bitcoin in 115 different countries based on average electricity rates according to government data, utility company data, and/or reports. On another interesting note, it depends on the rig exactly how quickly a single coin can be mined. According to their calculations, this ranges from 548.56 days to 2194.22 days. The most expensive country by far is South Korea. For mining a single coin, you would need to cash out USD 26,170 - hardly a good trade-off. Niue, an island country in the South Pacific Ocean, comes in second, with a significantly cheaper rate of “only” USD 17,566. In third place is Bahrain, where you would need USD 16,773, fourth place belongs to the Solomon Islands standing at USD 16,209, and number five are the Cook Islands with USD 15,861 - still not worth its value on the current market. After these staggering numbers, the cheapest countries look like a delight to live in: the cheapest by far is Venezuela, with only USD 531 needed for that one coin. But, as EliteFixtures.com explains, “Their electricity rates are heavily subsidized by the government, leading to incredibly low prices.” Second cheapest are Trinidad and Tobago at USD 1,190, followed by Uzbekistan and its USD 1,788. Europe’s only truly cheap country is Ukraine, where mining a single coin costs USD 1,852, and then it’s back to Asia with Myanmar, where it costs USD 1,983 to quench your FOMO (fear of missing out). Whether you decide to mine or trade may depend on your country of residence. If you’re from South Korea, you would need a miracle on the market to ever break even. But if you’re from Venezuela, go for it - unless you’re already into petro."
0," Bitcoin saw an increase in the bearish pressure, which pushed the price below a crucial support at USD 11,000. It sparked a bearish wave in altcoins as well, and cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin cash, Litecoin and Neo registered healthy declines. There was no particular fundamental reason and it mostly seems to be a technical breakdown below USD 11,000 in BTC/USD.  Bitcoin
Yesterday, we discussed how bitcoin price was consolidating above a key support at USD 11,000. Later, BTC/USD faced an increased selling pressure and the pair broke the mentioned support.
As a result, the pair is down 6.3% to USD 10,550. It even broke the USD 10,600 support, which is a bearish sign. The next major support on the downside is at USD 10,200, followed by USD 10,000.
On the upside, the broken support at USD 11,000 may perhaps act as a strong resistance if the price corrects higher during the coming sessions. Ethereum
Ethereum also followed bitcoin and tumbled by around 6.9% to USD 787. It broke a major support area at USD 800, which ignited further losses.
An immediate support on the downside is at USD 780. Below the mentioned USD 780, the next target for sellers could be USD 750. On the upside, the USD 800 and 820 levels have turned into resistances. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash tumbled 7.10% to USD 1,150. It seems like bitcoin dragged a few major altcoins along with it, and it may extend further. The next major support on the downside is at USD 1,100.
Ripple also declined by around 7% and moved back below USD 0.9500. XRP/USD could extend losses toward the USD 0.85 and 0.80. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today’s best performer so far is Iconomi, a digital asset management platform. ICN price moved up by more than 25% to USD 2.15. The main reason was the announcement to support fourteen new countries for Tier 2 Verification - Angola, Australia, Bolivia, Dominican Republic, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Namibia, Pakistan, Philippines, Senegal, Taiwan and Thailand.  Overall, the current market sentiment is slightly negative and if bitcoin price fails to recover from USD 10,500, there can be more downsides in the near term."
1," On August 24, 2017, the much awaited SegWit upgrade to the Bitcoin network was activated and with it came the promise of lower transaction fees and faster confirmation times. Now, six months after the activation, SegWit adoption is on the rise and the benefits of this network upgrade are finally being felt by active bitcoin users.  Currently, over a quarter of bitcoin transactions are SegWit transactions. This is more than twice as many as in October 2017 and the number is on the rise according to data compiled by SegWit.Party. This is translating into much lower transaction fees and a substantial increase in transaction speeds than we witnessed in the second half of 2017.  The increase in adoption is thanks to the growing number of bitcoin service providers who are implemented the network upgrade.  Moreover, version 0.16.0 of Bitcoin Core, the standard software client of the bitcoin network, was released on February 26 to provide full support for SegWit in the wallet and user interfaces, which has helped to boost SegWit adoption.  As a result of the increasing SegWit adoption, the number of unconfirmed transactions has dropped dramatically for first time in four months. Furthermore, average bitcoin transaction fees dropped from a high of over USD 50 in December to a current price of around USD 3.  It has to be said though, that the number of confirmed transaction did not solely drop due to the increase in SegWit adoption but also because outstanding bitcoin buy orders were clogging the network at the end of 2017 when bitcoin was close to its USD 20,000 all-time high and because of bitcoin’s price drop, fewer people are buying bitcoin now than in late 2017.  Nonetheless, in light of the slow transactions times and high fees we witnessed in November and December of last year, this is a welcome sight to the active bitcoin community who actually use bitcoin as a spending currency and to send money abroad.  Furthermore, the rise in SegWit adoption is giving a clear signal that the bitcoin community wants to see bitcoin succeed, not only as a digital-gold like investment asset but as the world’s leading alternative currency.  *** Background Segregated Witness, more commonly referred to as SegWit, is an upgrade to the Bitcoin network that has been activated in August 2017 to provide a solution to bitcoin’s scalability challenges and to eliminate the issue of transaction malleability. 
SegWit aids bitcoin’s scalability by increasing the effective block size without increasing the block size limit. Instead, SegWit removes signature data in each block to increase the number of bitcoin transactions that can be put into each block. This leads to the Bitcoin blockchain being able to process more transactions per second that before. 
Prior to February, dozens of bitcoin wallets and exchanges - including Electrum, Ledger, LocalBitcoins, and Wirex - have already implemented SegWit much to the appreciation of their customers. 
Bitcoin wallet and exchange Luno’s SegWit announced SegWit support on February 14 and popular digital currency exchange Bitfinex made its announcement on February 20. 
On February 23, Coinbase announced that it is implementing SegWit on both its Coinbase wallet and its GDAX exchange.

1," The Economic Times of India’s Global Business Summit took place this week, and it was inevitable that the cryptocurrency sector was going to be one of the topics discussed at length. What wasn’t foreseen, however, was Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak coming forward and saying he was a victim of a bitcoin scam.  It’s been known for quite some that bitcoin, as well as every other virtual currency, holds a lot of risks. But when the co-founder of one of the largest technology companies in the world falls into its trap, then we know that anyone is susceptible to being duped by cryptocurrency scams.  According to Wozniak, he had seven bitcoins stolen from him through fraud. Essentially what happened is this: an individual purchased the bitcoins from the 67-year old American entrepreneur and inventor through a credit card, and then proceeded to terminate the credit card payment. The scariest part of it all, according to Steve Wozniak, was just how easy it was to steal the bitcoins.  Sure, at first glance, seven bitcoins might not seem like a lot. However, it’s actually the opposite. At the time, Wozniak purchased the bitcoins back when it was valued at $700, but today, his loss is valued at roughly $71,400. Personally, this would have scared me off right away, but that wasn’t the case for the Apple co-founder.  >>India’s NASSCOM Partners With Blockchain Institute Wozniak kept his bitcoin holdings until the end of 2017. When he did finally announce in January that he sold his bitcoin holdings, he didn’t cite the bitcoin scam. In fact, he said it was only because he had only moved into cryptocurrency solely for experimental purposes. He then added that he never wanted to become one of those individuals that constantly watch it and fret over the price. That is extremely justifiable. It seems every week I’m biting my nails to see the direction the cryptocurrency is heading in. One week it’s dropping below the $12,000 mark and the next its well above it.  Now that we know about Steve Wozniak’s experience with the digital currency, I think it will be interesting to see if people follow in his lead and sell their bitcoin holdings in fear of falling victim to a bitcoin scam.

1," Curtis Jackson just went from alleged Bitcoin millionaire to zero, reported celebrity news site The Blast. Known by his stage name 50 Cent and affectionately called Fiddy, the rapper filed documents in his bankruptcy case admitting that “recent media reports have falsely stated” that he failed to disclose alleged interests in Bitcoin to his Bankruptcy Court, but in reality he has “never owned, and does not own, a Bitcoin account or any Bitcoins, and to the best of his knowledge, none of his companies had a Bitcoin account from 2014 to the present.” Last month, TMZ reported that the rapper “discovered” he had made millions thanks to letting people buy his 2014 album Animal Ambition using Bitcoin. Not only did he not correct the reports, he also encouraged them through a now-deleted photo on his Instagram account where he said he was feeling “proud of himself” in the caption. As to why, in the court documents obtained by The Blast, Fiddy explains: “As a general matter, so long as a press story is not irreparably damaging to my image or brand, I usually do not feel the need to publicly deny the reporting. This is particular true when I feel the press report in question is favorable to my image or brand, even if the report is based on a misunderstanding of the facts or contains outright falsehoods.” This is not the first time he claimed to have more money than he does:  in 2016, he told a judge that the cash in one of his Instagram photos was ""prop money."""
1," Bitcoin fees are down from USD 26 to USD 3 on average, to a collective sigh of relief from the entire community. It fell on USD 0.79 on Sunday, having peaked at USD 34 on December 23. Once, Bitcoin’s very low transaction fees were one of its selling points - until they soared in December 2017, showing that the prices are not the only volatile thing about Bitcoin. The climb of fees in late 2017 had many shying away from Bitcoin as a payment system; for example, Valve, an American video game developer and digital distribution company, stopped accepting Bitcoin on Steam. Bitpay, a bitcoin payment service provider, set a minimum transaction size to USD 100 - before promptly lowering it to USD 5 due to customer uproar - and Stripe, a payment processor, stopped accepting Bitcoin payments for customers in January due to the fact that thanks to high fees, there were “fewer and fewer use cases” for it. Some other companies switched to other cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin Cash, which was mostly created in the first place to keep fees lower. So the simplest answer to decreasing fees would be the decreasing number of transactions. A handy chart from Bitinfocharts.com shows the average fees: While another from Blockchain.info shows the number of transactions:  When compared, it seems that the fees and the prices shot up simultaneously, but also fell together. This is easily explained by people being willing to pay top dollar to get their Bitcoins into exchanges to sell them at the high prices of December. As the prices fell, so did people’s interest, and transaction fees simply followed suit. The decrease in transactions, however, is another matter entirely. There is a realistic possibility that exorbitant fee prices have forced large transaction processors to implement a technology called “batching”. It means including many payments to many different recipients into a single Bitcoin transaction - thus leaving more space on the blockchain. That is exactly what crypto exchange ShapeShift did, according to their announcement.  Mike Belshe, BitGo, a Blockchain security company, engineer, said to Coindesk that, “even if just one large exchange started batching transactions, it could have a huge impact on the overall transaction load.” Another solution to this problem that has already occurred to some was to simply raise the block size in Bitcoin - which produced Bitcoin Cash after the group did not get their way. Since the forking, what remained behind was the “small block” faction, which will fight tooth and claw to find a way around the problem without raising the block size. So they’ve focused on a technological upgrade called Segregated Witness (known as SegWit in the industry) that separates cryptographic signatures from the rest of the blockchain data, thus effectively increasing block size. Rolling out the necessary changes for SegWit takes time, though -  six months after the upgrade went into effect, only about 14% of Bitcoin transactions use the new format. There hasn't been much of a recent increase in SegWit use either. For the past several months, only about 10-14% of transactions, according to SegWit tracking site SegWit Party. Resurgence of Bitcoin fees is a real possibility. If the current trend continues, a new rise in the price might bring higher fees as well - so low prices right now may be a blessing in disguise. But for now, lower fees might set a new standard, thus restricting them from rising to previous heights."
0," I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again, it seems that people either love cryptocurrency and blockchain or they hate it. There’s no in-between. There’s no Switzerland. It’s an all or nothing sort of deal.  Earlier today, the U.K. Treasury Committee launched an inquiry into cryptocurrency and blockchain, stating that it will be looking into the risks and dangers open to consumers who use cryptocurrencies. Also announced today is that one of India’s most prominent tech industry organizations has partnered with the BRI, Blockchain Resource Institute. Why? To create a blockchain institute which will develop skill sets for blockchain adoption and usage in India. Pretty different compared to the U.K’s announcement, right? One country dislikes cryptocurrency and blockchain, the other loves it. Enough, at least, to partner with the BRI in order to help create a digital economy in India.  We also know that Canada is team cryptocurrency and blockchain. I mean, KFC now accepts Bitcoin as payment. That wasn’t enough, however, as India’s National Association of Software Services Companies (NASSCOM) disclosed today that BRI researchers will be backed by the government of Canada. The Canadian government, whose Prime Minister is Justin Trudeau, will be helping BRI developers to learn more about blockchain technology. The hope is that it will teach the researchers how to create various blockchain-based tools in India.  Blockchain has become extremely popular as of late. There are dozens of companies starting to integrate the technology into their corporate world. The chairman of NASSCOM stated that he believes blockchain will be beneficial to the nation but knows that it will be a long-term effort. In fact, the research is being split into two separate parts. The second phase will be the construction of a blockchain institute in India.  It will be interesting to see if all goes planned. If it does, I think it would be quite revolutionary.  Even CNN stated that a blockchain institute in India would “provide high-end technology capabilities.” What do you think?

0," Is Bitcoin (BTC) the reason behind the crypto selloff? The crypto market has experienced some major losses in the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, all coins but two within the top 100, are down right now. To get a taste of the bloodshed, take a look at the data from CoinMarketCap: The top ten cryptocurrencies are all experiencing major losses. Leading the pack in losses is Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC). There’s no denying that the markets are struggling – but why? Bitcoin may be the reason. >> Check out the Crypto Olympics: Bitcoin vs. VeChain Bitcoin transaction fees are at their lowest level since October 2017. According to BitInfoCharts, which was last updated on February 20th, Bitcoin transactions fees are going for US$3.042. Bitcoin transactions fees have been declining ever since hitting their all-time high back in December 2017 (US$55.16). However, even as recently as a couple of weeks ago, Bitcoin transactions fees were in the $10 range. That’s not terribly expensive, but $3.00 is even better. I would imagine that there are a lot of people taking advantage of the relatively cheap Bitcoin transaction fees. This may explain why many of the altcoins are declining today – people are selling their altcoin assets so they can gobble up Bitcoin while it’s cheap to process. In addition to the cheap Bitcoin transaction fees, Coinbase and Bitfinex will be updating the exchanges with a software called SegWit. SegWit (Segregated Witness), is touted as a way to speed up Bitcoin transactions while also lowering fees by a further 20%. It does so by increasing the block size (so more transactions will be able to fit per block). This will drastically improve Bitcoin’s efficiency as a cryptocurrency if SegWit does what it is meant to do. Bitfinex accounts for almost 38% of all US dollar-Bitcoin trades. Coinbase accounts for about 17%. Coinbase’s rollout of SegWit won’t fully come into effect until the middle of next week; however, Bitfinex’s support of SegWit was announced yesterday. The adoption of SegWit by these two major exchanges will no doubt have strong long-term effects for Bitcoin. For right now, this could also be accounting for the altcoin selloff currently happening. People are getting ready to take advantage of the lower Bitcoin transaction fees and processing times by selling their other cryptos now. Neither of these points changes the fact that Bitcoin is also currently down. As for why Bitcoin is down right now, I’m not sure. But if Bitcoin is down, it’s little surprise that many of the other coins are also down. When Bitcoin drops, people tend to panic, selling not only their Bitcoin but also their other crypto assets. >> Bitcoin Price Watch Featured image: artispixel"
0," The Bull Run Ends: Finally bulls lost their momentum after a two-week rally – which doubled the Bitcoin (BTC) price from the lows seen on Feb 6. Bitcoin, Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH) and the remaining top 20 currencies all posted significant losses today, and only Monero seems untouched by the crash. Bitcoin price was close to hitting the $12,000 mark yesterday; but BTC price took a big U-turn today, dipping more than 8% to the level of $10,700.  The crackdown on bitcoin traders in Bangladesh and pessimistic comments from the Bank of England weighed on cryptocurrency prices. The renewed regulatory concerns along with trader’s strategy to capitalize on the recent rally impacted virtual currency prices. The Dhaka Tribune reported a more forceful crackdown on cryptocurrency traders, and the report suggested that local police are “on the hunt for bitcoin users.” The Bangladeshi government warned their citizens to avoid using bitcoin for any financial transactions. Bangladesh Bank said, “Bitcoin is neither accepted nor considered legal tender anywhere in the world.” Bangladesh is among the third world countries and has been seeing high levels of corruption and money laundering. The country had previously barred their citizens from transferring money to abroad via illegal sources such as Hundi.  The emergence of digital currencies and their anonymity feature opened the doors for money launders to make the big movement of money. Bank of England (BoE) Chief Mark Carney added to bearish sentiments. He said, “Bitcoin has pretty much failed as a currency by standard benchmarks and is neither a store of value nor a useful way to buy items.” Mark Carney comments look strong because of the significant price volatility. For instance, if you want to purchase goods through bitcoin, then how would you settle the price for those goods given the significant bitcoin price swings?  Ethereum and Ripple, the second and the third largest digital currency, plunged more than 9% in Wednesday trading. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) were among the most prominent laggards; both fell more than 13% today. The selloff has wiped off $50 billion from total market capitalization of cryptocurrency markets. Analysts have a mixed opinion on the future of cryptocurrencies. Some analysts are predicting a sharp growth, while others are forecasting a lousy ending. Governments and central banks are supporting the innovative blockchain technologies; they have several concerns over the illegal use of virtual currencies, and their lack of underlying value.

0," Following new guidelines from Finland’s Treasury published on Tuesday, Finnish authorities are now trying to devise a means to store 2,000 Bitcoins confiscated since 2016. According to Bloomberg, the Treasury guidelines prohibit authorities from storing the stash - currently worth around USD 22.8 million - on virtual exchanges or services. Instead, they are to be kept off the internet, in a cold storage. Finnish authorities have declined to comment on how the confiscated coins have been kept up to now.  According to the customs office in Helsinki, most of the coins have been confiscated in dozens of raids conducted since 2016. In this case, the Finnish government prohibits authorities from considering any crypto asset as currency; rather, it is defined as “an asset that, as a rule, can’t be used or accepted as a means of payment or as an investment,” according to the Treasury document. After a binding court ruling on the confiscation of these Bitcoins, the Finnish state will convert the assets into euros at public auctions, since commercial exchanges can be “untrustworthy and opaque,” says the Treasury. Confiscated cryptocurrency being auctioned off by the state is not without precedent. In December 2017, during an undercover bust of an underground crime network, Bulgaria has seized enough Bitcoin to pay off a fifth of its national debt - a stunning 213,519 Bitcoins, at the time valued at USD 3.5 billion.  Following this case, on January 22nd, the US Marshal’s Office auctioned off 3,813 Bitcoins seized in criminal investigations, the sum of which amounted to nearly USD 50 million on commercial exchanges."
1," Bitcoin Soars 80%: Bitcoin (BTC) price has been on a rollercoaster over the last couple of months.The lack of underlying value and unpredictable nature of digital currencies continues to stun investors with massive sideways movements.    Since showing the considerable upside volatility at the end of last year, bitcoin’s downside volatility led the price to bottom near $6,000. After the massive selloff in late January and early February, bitcoin price rose 80% in the last two weeks alone. Bitcoin price has breached the $11000 mark during the weekend; the coin is trading at just over $11,000 this morning  – and now has the market capitalization of $185 billion. The broader rally in cryptocurrency prices has pushed the total market capitalization above $500 billion for the first time in the last three weeks.  Regulatory concerns along with the price manipulation and bearish remarks from notables were the key drivers for the violent selloff in bitcoin prices. However, softer than expected regulatory actions from South Korea and the United Stated led bulls to control the market over the last two weeks. South Korean authorities have been steadily moving back from their earlier strict stance. They have implemented less severe regulatory actions than what investors had initially thought. The U.S. CFTC chairman said, “regulators should have a thoughtful and balanced response and not a dismissive one.” Moreover, predictions of sustainable growth in bitcoin prices from key analysts have been adding to bullish sentiments. Saxo Bank analyst, Kay Van-Petersen, who appropriately predicted the substantial rally in cryptocurrency price at the start of last year – now forecasts that bitcoin is set to hit the $100,000 mark. Cryptocurrencies are in early stages, and it’s quite difficult to predict whether they will turn out to be a huge bubble, or if they can replace the traditional financial world. The Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin warned investors for the possible slump. He suggested investors invest the money only if they can afford to lose. He said: cryptocurrencies are still a new and hyper-volatile asset class, and could drop to near-zero at any time. Don’t put in more money than you can afford to lose. If you’re trying to figure out where to store your life savings, traditional assets are still your safest bet. Featured Image: twitter"
1," Calvin Ayre, a Bitcoin and gambling multimillionaire, is building a USD 100 million five-star resort on Antigua funded by his own crypto-profits made from the rise in value of Bitcoin in which he was an early investor. “This resort will attract a totally new market segment of tourism on the island — successful wellness-seekers who also want to have fun. The property will not be an all-inclusive destination. Instead, its amenities will be available to residents of Antigua and Barbuda and visitors alike,” according to the press release.  Ayre is a Bitcoin Cash (BCH) supporter, and this cryptocurrency will be accepted at the resort, at point of sale terminals on the property and through its online booking engine. His crypto-related involvement does not end here by any measure. In January 2018, he revealed he has dedicated significant amounts of his investment funds towards creating a BCH mining operation. The mining facility will dedicate its power to the Bitcoin Cash blockchain only. Ayre is a Canadian-Antiguan entrepreneur based in Antigua and Barbuda, and the founder of the Ayre Group and Bodog entertainment brand. He boasts the official title of “his excellency”, given to him by Antigua and Barbuda. In August 2017, he acquired cryptocurrency news site Coingeek.com."
1," Bitcoin’s design might have a fatal flaw in that it could not handle a liquidity shock due to its decentralized nature, JPMorgan said in a recent note, Business Insider reported. In a liquidity crisis, central banks simply print more money to make up for a decline in lending and spending in the private sector. Since there is no institution which sets the rate for Bitcoin creation, such a solution would be impossible. JPMorgan states in their note: “The ability to provide adequate liquidity is a hallmark of a well-functioning market, but more so during times of crisis. One benefit of fiat money is that it can be used to provide emergency liquidity from the outside. This is the role central banks play as the lender-of-last resort.” In the other corner of the ring, Bitcoin fans argue that JPMorgan assumes that this way of patching up the economy is actually good.  Aaron Lasher, the chief marketing officer at Breadwallet, a bitcoin wallet company, asks why there is any need for emergency liquidity in the first place. In his opinion, it all comes down to the fact that fiat currencies are centralized and thus printable at the whim of a certain group of people - central bankers. These bankers face no risks for themselves - they can always print more money to back themselves up, with the consequence of inflation. Arthur Hayes, the chief executive at BitMEX, a P2P bitcoin trading platform, points out that money printing is hardly the best solution for economies at the brink of collapse - as Zimbabwe and Venezuela can testify. He adds, “Money printing delays the inevitable. Without the ability to print base money at all, any institutional that extended credit would be evaluated by the market on its ability to responsibly originate loans.” Although printing money as a last reserve is a viable solution in a controlled environment, like the US did after the recent financial crisis, Zimbabwe and Venezuela are examples of how it can go wrong for everyone else."
1," The market sentiment improved further and it seems like buyers are slowly taking charge. There was no negative news or development, which helped cryptocurrencies and lifted the prices of bitcoin, Ethereum, litecoin, ripple and bitcoin cash. Technically, the current bias is bullish and further gains seem likely.  BitcoinBitcoin succeeded in surpassing the USD 10,000 level. BTC/USD traded above the USD 10,300 and formed a high at USD 10,323. Later, a downside correction was initiated and the price moved back below USD 10,000.
However, the current price action is positive with more than 1% intraday gains. The current price is USD 9,910 and the price is preparing for the next move. It may perhaps move above the USD 10,000 resistance once again. 
On the downside, supports are at USD 9,800, 9,600 and 9,500. To the topside, a break above USD 10,300 could push the price towards USD 10,500. Ethereum
Ethereum is trading 1.2% lower today. However, the ETH/USD pair was able to hold the USD 900 support. At the moment, the pair is struggling to move above the USD 945 and 950 resistance levels.
The stated resistance levels are crucial hurdles, and a break above USD 950 is required for a test of the all-important USD 1,000 level. Support on the downside are at USD 900 and 880. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash was one the best performing coins today. It is currently trading 8.10% higher from the USD 1,301 low. It moved above the USD 1,500 level, formed a high at USD 1,546 and later started a downside correction. BCH/USD is currently trading at USD 1,475 and it looks set for another push above USD 1,500.
Ripple was down 2.6% to USD 1.080. XRP/USD is struggling to move above the USD 1.15 and 1.20 resistance levels. In the short term, there could be ranging moves between USD 1.00 and 1.20. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today’s best performer was MonaCoin, with 15% gains. There were other altcoins as well with similar gains such as NXT and VeChain. On the flip side, the recent best performers – U.CASH and WAX started a downside correction and moved down by 20% and 18% respectively."

1," Five years ago, a 26-year-old Bitcoin miner named Matthew Moody died in a plane crash during an observational flight. His father Michael has been looking for a way to access his late son’s crypto wallet, hosted by blockchain.info, for the past three years without much success, Bloomberg reports. Michael Moody has no way to access these funds without the private keys, or a special code needed to access the funds, and there is no way to find out even how much is in that wallet. Moody added that young people “need to be better educated about the steps needed to be taken to ensure their investments are properly secured, both for themselves and for future heirs.” On the topic of how to pass down your cryptocurrency after death, Peter Henning, a professor at Wayne State University Law School and veteran SEC and Justice Department lawyer, said, “My bet is that ICOs [Initial Coin Offering], when issued by a company, they’re going to be considered securities. If they are securities, then just like stock or bonds you can put them in your will and pass them down.” But this may be some time in coming. In the meantime, the crypto exchange CoinBase offers an alternative solution: the company asks for documents such as a death certificate and will in order to transfer the assets. But the idea of somebody else being in custody of your crypto is not in line with its idea of decentralization. The problem of death through accident, like in Moody’s case, still remains. It is highly unlikely that someone in their 20s or 30s would have a will ready in case something happened to them - and even then, adding your crypto wallet keys to the will may slip your mind. This way, the keys are lost - perhaps forever."
0," At this point, it’s fair to say the cryptocurrency industry is constantly evolving. Over the course of the past couple of months, we have seen a number of countries roll out new uses for virtual currencies. In Canada, for instance, individuals can now use Bitcoin to purchase meals from KFC. In Australia, travelers will soon be able to purchase items using Bitcoin in the Brisbane Airport. Now, we’ve been informed that luxury flats in Dubai can be purchased with the virtual currency. In fact, there have already been 50 flats sold in Dubai for Bitcoin. Business Insider published a report yesterday which stated that two UK entrepreneurs have sold 50 luxury flats in Dubai for Bitcoin. This is significant news as it suggests the cryptocurrency industry, at least in Dubai, might be making a move into real estate. The world was informed in September of last year that the two entrepreneurs, Michelle Mone and Douglas Barrowman, had launched a $325 million luxury development in Dubai. It is forecasted to be finished in two years. After announcing the launch of the ‘Aston Plaza and Residences’, Mone and Barrowman promised that they will be offering 150 apartments that can be purchased using bitcoin. For perspective, the entrepreneurs will be offering 150 apartments out of the 1,3000 for bitcoin. Offering luxury apartments in Dubai for bitcoin is definitely a first, but it appears investors are on board with it. According to the February Business Insider report, 50 out of the 150 apartments offered have been sold. In fact, Mone told the publication that there were a couple buyers who purchased two apartments. To top it off, Mone, who is the founder of lingerie brand Ultimo, stated that there was one buyer who bought as many as ten luxury Dubai apartments. This news comes at a time when more and more people are fighting to see more cryptocurrency regulation. In fact, the United States, Germany, and France have all called for crypto regulation to be discussed at next month’s G20 summit in Argentina. Therefore, it will be interesting to see how the outcome of the summit affects the potential sale of more Dubai apartments for bitcoin. Read More About Cryptocurrency Regulation >> What do you think?

1," Bitcoin predictions: Cryptocurrencies have been stabilizing over the past three days – something rather unprecedented. Markets had witnessed Bitcoin’s upside volatility last year but found it equally volatile on the downside; the slump from $19,000 to less than $6,000 in last month alone vindicated the instability for both trends.   In spite of the massive sideways movement, returns from crypto funds topped hedge fund returns last year. For instance, Pantera Capital, which started its first cryptocurrency fund in 2013, generated returns of 22,000 percent since its inception. Last year, Cryptocurrency fund returns were significantly higher from the average gains of 7% from hedge funds. Dan Morehead, the CEO of Pantera Capital, who bought his first bitcoin for around $72, is now predicting a substantial rally in price. He said, “Bitcoin should return to peak levels in the next couple of weeks and will continue growing from there.” In December, Dan predicted bitcoin price to fall by half before rising back up. The first part of his prediction turned out to be true and now traders are carefully thinking about the second part of his prophecy.  Bitcoin and other digital currencies are showing strong support trading around their current level. The entire cryptocurrency market has been flat over the last three days; seems it is looking for solid reports to make a new trend. Some analysts are now correlating the movement of crypto markets with stock markets, expecting prices to trade in similar trends.  This assumption could be partially correct as the overall market sentiments offer support to the whole investment markets. Last year, the rally in tech, financial and industrial stocks combined with Trump’s business pro initiatives, led the major U.S. indices to hit new records. Though Bitcoin and digital currencies have beaten stock market returns last year, the market dynamics seems quite tough this year. Experts are predicting the crash, while regulators are making strict rules to reduce illegal activities associated with the currencies. Global financial institutions are calling them a risk to global financial stability. However, traders aren’t ignoring the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies; allowing bulls to strengthen their stance of getting support from regulatory actions. They believe regulating cryptocurrencies could turn out to be a positive catalyst for long-term sustainability. Featured Image: twitter"
1," Bitcoin price is gaining bullish momentum and moved above the USD 8,000 resistance. Ethereum, Bitcoin cash and other major altcoins followed the bullish trend and moved higher. However, the third largest cryptocurrency, Ripple failed to capitalize and traded lower by roughly 3%. Today’s best performer so far is bitcoin cash since it is up by around 21% and is currently trading above USD 1,200. During the upside move, BCH/USD broke an important resistance at USD 1,000 to set the pace for more gains. The past two sessions were bullish on bitcoin as the cryptocurrency started a fresh upside move after correcting lower towards the USD 7,500 support. During the recent upside move, the price broke the USD 8,000 and 8,200 resistance levels to set the pace for more gains. Technically, bitcoin was up more than 4% and is currently trading above USD 8,500. If it continues to move higher, it could easily move past USD 8,800. Above USD 8,900, the price will most likely break the USD 9,000 resistance. On the downside, support sits at USD 8,000. A break below the stated USD 8,000 support may call for a new downside wave towards the USD 7,600 and USD 7,400 levels. Ethereum posted minor gains and traded higher by 1.6% to USD 843. It seems like ETH/USD is finding hard to pierce the USD 850 and 865 resistance levels. A push above the mentioned levels may perhaps call for a test of USD 1,000. Ripple price was down today by roughly 3% to USD 0.7600. XRP/USD has to move above USD 0.8000 to continue higher, otherwise, there is a risk of a downside reaction in the near term. LTC/USD was down 1% to USD 150 and it seems like litecoin price is struggling to maintain upward bias."
0," Bitcoin prediction: It’s been the roughest week yet for cryptocurrencies as the price of Bitcoin sank to just over $6000 – its lowest since November. This, coupled with regulatory fears and ICO scams, has led to increasingly bearish sentiments towards the cryptocurrency market in general. It has lost $340 billion USD since the start of the year. So it’s great news for investors today, as the price of Bitcoin unexpectedly soared 11.4% – over $800 USD – from last night’s low, at 3:30 pm EST this afternoon (the time of writing). But the even bigger news is that analysts are predicting Bitcoin to hit $50K this year. In an interview with CNBC, Thomas Glucksmann, head of APAC business development at Gatecoin, said that “There is no reason why we couldn’t see bitcoin pushing $50,000 by December.” This, he says, is due to a market rebound as well as “major technology developments” such as bitcoin’s upcoming Lightning Network, which aims to speed up transactions. >> Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC): Coins to Invest in Before the Market Recovers In the same report, Jamie Burke, CEO of Outlier Ventures, stated that he believes the market will likely go on a bull run. It will be “comparative if not greater than last year potentially reaching the trillion-dollar mark before a proper crypto winter sets in,” he said. This ‘crypto winter‘ refers to a period where the market will settle down and focus on market fundamentals, potentially becoming more stable. And to top it all off, Ran Neuner, host of CNBC’s Cryptotrader show, pinned this tweet to his account in a moment of bravery: For the record, I am pinning this tweet. Bitcoin will finish 2018 at $50 000. — Ran Neuner (@cryptomanran) February 2, 2018 With such optimism abound in the industry, it may really be true that we’ll see Bitcoin grow tens of thousands of dollars in coming months. But it’s important to bear in mind that such predictions have been made before… >> Cryptocurrencies – Excitement is Limited In 2014, a Coindesk poll showed that most readers thought that one Bitcoin would reach $10,000 by the end of that year, while venture capital firm LightSpeed India gave it a more modest $4000 – $5000. It ended the year at about $315. This goes both ways, of course. In 2015, a Financial Times article gave a bleak outlook for the cryptocurrency, playing on the fact that it had been floating at around $350 for months and that the chances of it becoming a mainstream currency ‘are now zero’. The mainstream currency statement is still debatable, but the article certainly hasn’t aged well since bitcoin hit nearly $20,000 per coin about three years later. Anyway, none of this is to say that bitcoin won’t do well this year, but it is a casual reminder to be wary of predictions which seem authoritative. Either way, it looks as though it’s safe to be bullish at the moment and hope that today’s great performance continues in coming weeks. Featured image: BTCmanager.com"
1," The cryptocurrency market is continuing to rebound after a shaky day yesterday. Coincidentally, the Dow Jones plunged a total of 1,100 points yesterday, around 4.6%, which is the lowest since the European debt crisis back in 2011. The stock market corrected itself from yesterday’s downfall, is there a correlation between the two? I really don’t think so. The cryptocurrency market crash plummeted yesterday, due to the Chinese government implementing a regulation completely banning its citizens from viewing cryptocurrency websites, via a government-ran firewall. Many analysts are stating that yesterday’s drop was due to rising inflation and the usual market correction. This shows that there is absolutely no correlation between the drop of the two markets. Back in 2008, the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), and its blockchain were born. It was due to the housing financial crisis, where the banks (due to greed) crashed the entire stock market. Satoshi Nakamoto, the Alias, and originator of Bitcoin envisioned a decentralized digital currency that isn’t controlled by a singular entity – this was Bitcoin’s original promise. >> Bitcoin Price Analysis Bitcoin as an Investment Asset? However, the issue most individuals are having with Bitcoin is that it is failing to live up to its original promise. Bitcoin and its blockchain were intended, by its unknown creator, to be a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Its current scalability issues have resulted in slow transaction times and high fees. BTC remains the top cryptocurrency with the highest total market cap and highest price, however, it could be passed in market cap this year. Just a year ago the digital currency held 85% of the total cryptocurrency market cap dominance but now, is currently only 35%. The digital token just this year has transitioned from a digital currency used for peer to peer transactions, to an investable asset, like gold and silver. Many new altcoins on the market are being used as a payment and transaction system instead because their transaction confirmation time is 10 times faster than that of Bitcoins. >> Stellar & Ripple Comparison Bitcoin doesn’t even come close to Litecoin (LTC), DASH (DASH), Ripple (XRP), and Stellar (XLM) when it comes to transaction time confirmation. Some Bitcoin holders now use the cryptocurrency to purchase large ticket items, such as houses and cars but day-to-day payments with BTC do not occur. If Bitcoin developers can agree upon and fix its scalability issue, it could potentially switch back to its original goal. However, with faster blockchain projects/coins popping up every day, I believe that it is highly unlikely. Featured Image: Gizmodo"
0," Global energy giant Enel has sharply announced that it has “no interest whatsoever” in supplying energy to cryptocurrency mining operations, say Reuters. The decision comes after a brief period of research in which the Italian company was in talks to supply Swiss mining firm Envion AG with power from renewable sources. According to a Bloomberg report, the discussions with Envion were part of a broader effort by Enel to look at the market for selling power to cryptocurrency miners. >> Mining for Charity: UNICEF’s Ethereum Donation Drive Enel is one of Europe’s top renewable energy suppliers and is also the primary energy supplier in Italy. It explained its decision in a report by Reuters, stating that they have made clear steps toward sustainable energy and therefore “sees the intensive use of energy dedicated to cryptocurrency mining as an unsustainable practice that does not fit with the business model it is pursuing.” The move is sure to disappoint Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiasts in the country, who likely are waiting for some good news amid harsh government crackdowns on cryptocurrencies elsewhere. On the bright side, despite Enel’s aversion to digital coins, they are still keen to explore the applications of blockchain technology in the energy industry. This was the primary focus of the EnelFocusOn event that was hosted in Santiago, Chile, on February 2nd. The event saw Joel Comm, a ‘blockchain evangelist’, highlight solutions offered by blockchain in “making the energy industry more sustainable”, say Enel. >> More Crypto Bans: Lloyds Shuts Down Credit Card Purchases Bitcoin mining is becoming a hot topic as governments, energy companies and environmentalists grow increasingly concerned with the huge amounts of electricity needed to operate mining farms. Many Chinese mining companies are looking to the west for potential mining spots as the Chinese government, overburdened by energy demand, begins a crackdown on the activity. Renewable energy is of particular interest given its abundance, sustainability and relative cheapness in places such as Canada, yet the demand is pushing suppliers to breaking point. Meanwhile, the Italian government has proposed cryptocurrency regulations which will ‘clarify’ the use of Bitcoin and others in the country. According to Coindesk, the regulations will help enforce new anti-money laundering rules put forward by the European Union. As a result, businesses who make transactions with cryptocurrency would be recorded. Featured image: Enel.com"
0," Want some free Bitcoin? You’ll have to solve a puzzle first. Artist Marguerite deCourcelle, also known as coin artist, has been hiding Bitcoin in digital paintings for years. Her third Bitcoin puzzle, released in April 2015, has finally been solved. Whoever solved the puzzle remains a mystery but they are now the proud new owner of around $50,000 worth of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin puzzle series, “The Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto”, has been going on for a long time. It took nearly three years for the third puzzle in the series, “TORCHED H34R7S”, to be solved. When deCourcelle and her team originally placed the key to the Bitcoin wallet into the digital painting, the wallet contained 4.87 Bitcoins – which was, at the time, worth about $1,400.  Source: Twitter >> Best crypto coins for small payments We can see from the wallet, known as 1FLAMEN6, that the prize has indeed been claimed: >> India threatens ban of crypto Nothing now remains in the wallet. The new Bitcoin owner must be thrilled to have solved such a mystifying and captivating puzzle for the crypto community. Interestingly, in November 2017, the wallet saw its first signs of activity since the puzzle had been released – not in the form of someone claiming the Bitcoin, but someone actually depositing more in! This mystery was revealed to be part of a Bitcoin hack that’s been quietly haunting the crypto world. It worked out for whoever solved the puzzle, though, because it meant there was more Bitcoin to claim. While the identity of the puzzle solver will remain anonymous, the solution for “TORCHED H34R7S” has now been released and it is quite the solution! From Shakespeare to keys acting as literal keys to coded flames, this solution has it all. For those hoping to have solved the puzzle themselves, the chase isn’t over yet! deCourcelle’s team is developing a new crypto game, called “Neon District”, this one with 15 ETH hidden within. “Neon District” is part of a crypto RPG that is riddled with easter eggs like this. As an avid puzzle solver myself, this is an extremely fascinating concept – and probably the closest us puzzle enthusiasts will get to feeling like Indiana Jones! I doubt I’ll ever be able to figure it out, but maybe some of you out there will have better luck. Happy puzzling! >> Read more about the crypt game “Neon District” Feature image: twitter"
0," Bitcoin price plummeted below the support level of $8000 for a third time today. The huge volatility in crypto markets wiped off more than $417 billion from the total market capitalization in the last month alone making this bitcoin price plunge one of the greatest yet. Consequently, the broader selloff has pulled back the cryptocurrency prices at the lowest level in the last three months. Bitcoin price plunged below $8,000 during the Friday trade, and although bounced back above $9,000 over the weekend, it has again dipped below $8,000 today. After those dramatic swings, it is currently trading in the range of $7,400.   China, which has recently expressed strong concerns over the cryptocurrency trading, is now planning to impose a complete ban on domestic and international cryptocurrency trading platforms. Based on the local media reports, the Central Bank of China is likely to block all platforms related to the issuance of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency trading. Already, China has banned cryptocurrency trading in domestic markets. But now, the country has extended the concentrated efforts to foreign platforms too. >>What Is France’s Stance On Bitcoin Regulations? The Financial News reported:  “In the future, any related (platform) will be closed as soon as it is found. At the same time, further regulatory measures will be taken with the future development of the situation,”   Last week, comments from the Indian finance minister created the huge crash in prices. During the budget speech, he stated that “the country wants to eliminate the use of digital currencies in criminal activities”  and this plunged the bitcoin price below $8,000 for the first time on Friday since November 24. Cryptocurrency mania seems to be ending over the last month. After South Korea, several major institutions have stressed for the strict regulatory actions against the cryptocurrencies. The largest U.S. banks such as Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase, have stopped their customers from buying cryptocurrencies using credit cards. Following that trend, the U.K. lender, Lloyds Banking Group, has also implemented the same policy. The signal is clear; there is less trust in cryptocurrency markets. Featured Image: twitter"
0," Another shipping company has now joined the global blockchain revolution, this time it’s UPS. According to a filing with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the global shipping giant is considering setting up a system of locker banks so that it could take in Bitcoin as payment.   >>Bitcoin Price Analysis – Can BTC/USD Rebound? Here’s how it works: As outlined in the USPTO filing document, a seller can leave an item inside a locker (which can be rented) for the buyer to pick up later-on by entering the designated payment, thus completing the transaction. The aim is to create a point-of-sale (POS) system that accepts the following payment methods: However, only time will tell whether this kind of locker bank system will appeal to the general public and whether people are willing to use Bitcoins to pay for UPS packages. This is not the first time that UPS expressed its intention to dabble in the blockchain industry. In November, the company joined a blockchain consortium called the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance, focused on the trucking and shipping industry. On joining the consortium, Linda Weakland, UPS director of enterprise architecture and innovation, stated: “The technology has the potential to increase transparency and efficiency among shippers, carriers, brokers, consumers, vendors and other supply chain stakeholders.” >>The Best Cryptocurrency Memes in 2018 (So Far) With today’s announcement, we are starting to see a trend where shipping companies — which make up a vital part of the global economy — are leaning towards using Bitcoin as a mainstream method of payment. Over the past two years, more than 50 filings released by the USPTO mentioned the leading cryptocurrency as a possible inclusion into their payment systems (such as Bank of America). Earlier today, FedEx also made significant progress in developing a blockchain-based platform for its daily business operations. It might not be long before the entire sector moves into the blockchain technology. Featured Image: twitter"
0," The correlation between Google search and price movement Analysts are now supporting their predictions using the Google search volume. Their assumptions are purely based on the number of people putting the bitcoin keyword into Google Search. According to estimates, Google search for bitcoin soared sharply in December. The worldwide searches for bitcoin tripled in December compared with the previous month. The strategy looks to be effective, considering the correlation between price movement, trading volume, and google searches. Colas, the first analyst to follow bitcoin said, “Google search patterns can forecast bitcoin’s future. He said he uses Google Trends to track how many people enter “bitcoin” into the search engine.” The growth in bitcoin popularity also supported the growth in numbers of wallets. However, Google search volume for bitcoin declined sharply by 75% in January and as it declined so did market value.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com   The popularity of Bitcoin (BTC) continues declining since the start of this month after hitting its peak in December ($19,000). It has fallen back to below $10,000. As expected, the movement in Google search volume reflected the bitcoin price movement. So, why are popularity and price going down? Several factors contributed to the decline in bitcoin’s popularity; negative comments from numerous leaders and Central Banks during World Economic Forum weighed on traders sentiments and potential buyers. A Crack-down on digital currency from South Korea, India and China has also impacted the trading volume. South Korea and China have banned cryptocurrency trading through anonymous accounts, amid the threat of criminal activities and during the budget presentation speech, the Indian finance minister clearly denounced cryptocurrencies; “The government does not consider cryptocurrencies as legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate the use of these crypto assets in financing illegitimate activities.” Market pundits are also blaming other blockchain technologies for the decline in bitcoin’s popularity. For instance, several payment services companies are showing their confidence in Ripple (XRP) and other blockchain technologies, due to faster transactions times than bitcoin. Stripe, the online payments company, announced it would not support Bitcoin anymore, citing a number of reasons for this move. Stripe said, “Bitcoin transaction confirmation times have risen substantially; this, in turn, has led to an increase in the failure rate of transactions. … By the time the transaction is confirmed, fluctuations in Bitcoin price mean that it’s for the “wrong” amount. … Furthermore, fees have risen a great deal … making Bitcoin transactions about as expensive as bank wires.”    Featured Image: twitter"
0," India’s anti-Bitcoin sentiments have caused a crypto-wide panic to spread around the world. The country’s finance minister Arun Jaitley announced during the budget speech today that cryptocurrency was not considered legal tender in India. When the news broke, people immediately began blowing his words out of proportion. Jaitley stated that the Indian government “will take all measures to eliminate the use of these cryptoassets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payments system.” >> What crypto coins are best for making small payments? This doesn’t mean the Indian government is planning to outright ban Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They will continue to caution against it and are planning to severely crack down on the illegal activities that result from crypto. But a full-scale ban? Not quite yet. Many people appear to have interpreted it this way, however, and cryptos have taken a rough beating today as a result. Bitcoin is down nearly 10% in the last 24 hours, dropping below $10,000, and out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, only two coins are actually up (DigixDAO and Aeternity) at the time of writing. >> Aeternity makes the list of our 5 cryptocurrencies under $5 10% may not seem like a whole lot, but because Bitcoin holds such a large amount of the overall crypto market cap, the crypto market cap has plummetted as a result. In the course of 24 hours, the total crypto market cap has tanked by around $50 billion. What we have witnessed today is a pretty good display of what would probably happen was India to actually ban crypto. India accounts for nearly 10% of all Bitcoin transactions (coincidence that that is also the percentage that Bitcoin fell today?). If crypto loses India, that could severely damage the market. What is interesting is that India is against crypto, but not against blockchain. Jaitley also stated that “The Government will explore use of block chain technology proactively for ushering in digital economy.” So it’s not all doom and gloom. Blockchain will survive, even if crypto doesn’t. What do you think? Will India change its mind and ban crypto altogether? Or is the panic all for nothing? >> KODAKCoin ICO launch delayed Featured image: hackernoon"
0," Bitcoin was under a lot of pressure during the past few hours, pushing the price below USD 10,000. Other major cryptocurrencies also declined, including bitcoin cash and ripple.  The best performing currency was Ethereum’s Ether as it remained in the green zone with minor gains of 0.6% to USD 1,108. The overall market sentiment is negative and digital assets may decline further in the near term. Today in India, the Union Budget 2018 was announced. Many investors and traders were eyeing the budget to know about the Government’s stand on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.  The finance minister made it clear that the digital currencies are not Legal Tender and the Government will take all measures to eliminate the use of bitcoins in financing illegitimate activities. There was no mention of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies Ban in India. However, this is not a very good sign for investors in India since the Government is not clarifying doubts whether trading is legal or not. There is also no clarity on tax structure for bitcoins and cryptocurrencies. On the positive side, Suwon District Court in South Korea has recognized that bitcoin has economic value. Moreover, Samsung recently confirmed that they are working on developing hardware for cryptocurrency mining.  In Arizona, it seems like there are positive developments as lawmakers are pushing a proposal to allow residents in Arizona to pay their taxes in bitcoins. In the altcoins arena, a document was released by the Grayscale Investments Company, which is one the biggest cryptocurrencies asset management firm. According to the document, Zcash token may perhaps rise to USD 60,000 in 2025. Overall, the marketremains in the red, with BTC/USD trading below the most important support at USD 10,000. It is currently trading lower by 6.9% to USD 9,511. The next major support on the downside is at USD 9,200, followed by the USD 9,000 level. ETH/USD is trading with a stable bias, but if the market continues to decline, Ether could trade below USD 1,080. Looking at the other digital currencies, bitcoin cash is down 8.5% to USD 1,370. The next major support for BCH/USD is at USD 1,300. Other altcoins such as LTC/USD declined toward USD 151 and is currently under a lot of pressure. NEO/USD is down 10% to USD 130."
0," The Suwon District Court in South Korea has recognized that bitcoin has economic value and therefore can be confiscated, Chosun News reported. The case was that of Ahn, 34, who was arrested in May last year and convicted of operating an illegal pornography site with approximately 1.2 million members. Ahn pocketed c. USD 1.78m in membership fees. While arresting him, the Southern Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency confiscated his 216 Bitcoins (c. USD 2m) from an online wallet which received some fees from the site. Only last year, during the same case, the same court ruled that Bitcoin is not subject to confiscation. The court was quoted as saying, “It is not appropriate to confiscate Bitcoins because they are in the form of electronic files without physical entities, unlike cash […] Virtual currency can not assume an objective standard value,” by the Kyunghyang Shinmun news outlet. According to Chosun News, the court now said that, “the crime profit concealment law does not restrict the criminal income to the goods but the cash, the deposit, the stock, and other property with economic value. Bitcoin can be changed into money through an exchange. It can be used as a means of payment through merchants, so it should be regarded as having economic value.” This is the first time Bitcoin’s economic value has been recognized by a Korean court."
1," Square Cash App finally integrates bitcoin support. Following a trial period involving a handful of users, the payment company launched bitcoin integration yesterday and saw a rise in stocks as a result. To accompany the launch, Square has also released a completely adorable Bitcoin tutorial in the style of a children’s book, titled ‘My First Bitcoin and the Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto‘. Through its colorful, pop-up artsy pages, the slideshow takes readers through the fundamental basics of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in terms an (albeit financially-minded) five-year-old could understand. Square CEO Jack Dorsey said in a tweet: “Instant buying (and selling, if you don’t want to hodl) of bitcoin is now available to most Cash App customers. We support Bitcoin because we see it as a long-term path towards greater financial access for all.” >> Turkish Soccer Team Purchases New Player With Bitcoin This is very good news for the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, which was recently dropped by online payment processor Stripe amid growing troubles with its use. Although today’s news still leaves bitcoin (BTC) in the red on coinmarketcap’s charts, Square’s stocks have risen around 3% in response. Square’s Cash app allows users to transfer funds on a person-to-person (P2P) or person-to-business basis, meaning you can pay a bill or send a friend $10. Today’s update will allow users to buy and deposit up to $10,000 USD worth of bitcoin per week, and with no additional purchase charge. In terms of pricing, Square will look across a range of exchanges to try and find an average. The only downside to all this is that technically, you don’t actually hold the bitcoin you use with Square; they do. >> Bitcoin Value Halves in January. What’s Next For the Cryptocurrency? Where bitcoins are traditionally held in a digital wallet tied to a device such as a computer, phone or even a memory stick, the coins a user owns on Square Cash are tied to their Square account, meaning they are out of the user’s hands to an extent. Some Bitcoin enthusiasts may argue that this counters the total financial freedom that Bitcoin is meant to endow. This does also present some upsides, however, as it means users can lose a device or their password and still recover their coins. In any case, crypto trading services are becoming increasingly popular as more begin to compete with Coinbase, the current standard. When trading service Robinhood announced it was to add zero-fee trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH), more than one million people signed up to the early-access waiting list. ‘Zero-fee’ is the buzzword here, as Coinbase typically charges 1.5 to 4 percent fees in the US. If Square can match this level of interest, it’s going to be a good year for the service, and possibly for cryptocurrency too. It certainly needs the rejuvenation.

1," This week, a Turkish soccer team, Harunustaspor use bitcoin to sign their newest player. The tiny Turkish soccer team has become the first in the world to purchase a payer using Bitcoin (BTC) or any cryptocurrency, making history. Club president Haldun Şehit proposed the deal, which amounts to a total of $1,197 USD, to player Ömer Faruk Kıroğlu, who agreed to play until the end of the season. The total amount comprises of 0.0524 BTC ($522.24 USD at the time of writing), and a further equivalent of $664.80 USD in cash. >> Soccer and Cryptocurrencies are starting to merge The deal is very small in comparison to what happens in other national leagues such as the UK’s Premier League, where signings regularly go for the equivalent of tens of millions of dollars. Indeed, Harunustaspor does not even compete in Turkey’s top football league, currently playing in the first division of Sakarya Amateur League. Yet today’s deal is still globally significant within the sport, which has been increasingly involved in cryptocurrency in recent weeks. Only last week, Arsenal signed a partnership deal with Cashbet Coin. Meanwhile, the London Football Exchange announced plans to launch its own cryptocurrency. With this in mind, Harunustapor’s offer may be small financially but it’s a huge step in terms of how digital currencies operate within sports. Quoted in Turkish-Football, Mr. Şehit said of the deal: “This is a first in Turkey and the world, and we are proud of this achievment.” Meanwhile, transferee Kıroğlu said: “This is the future. As someone open to new technology it made sense.” So what will happen going forward? No-one can really say. It could be that Harunustapor will be iconically known as the first soccer team to engage in a Bitcoin-based transfer. It could also mark the sport’s embrace of a new or alternative financial system. Or, it could simply blow over while things will carry on as usual. It’s hard to say, yet despite Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, in general, suffering big losses the past few weeks, soccer and other sports have embraced digital currency in some surprising and unlikely ways. An ICO token sale promoted by champion boxer Floyd Mayweather raised $30 million USD last year, while fans of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team will be able to purchase game tickets with Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) next season. This is not the first time that Turkey has pioneered cryptocurrency usage. Last month, it became the first country to settle a freight deal in Bitcoin between itself and a Russian ship delivering wheat. Do you think this is the start of a new way forward for sports teams, or will it prove to be just a trend? Featured Image: Twitter"
1," Bitcoin value halves in the first month of 2018.  Despite an incredible 2017, this January has been the worst month for Bitcoin. Bulls provided a lot of support to Bitcoin (BTC) price by presenting different theories and hypothesis that it is becoming a million dollar investment, ultimately though, bears controlled the price since the start of this year.  Bitcoin started this month trading around the $14,000 level with the price hitting a monthly high of $17,500 on Jan 5. Since then, however, bitcoin’s value has declined at a sharp pace. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading around $10,300, down 6% in past 24 hours.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com There are two major reasons. The volatile nature of bitcoin’s price leading to panic sell-offs, and the possibility of cryptocurrency regulations. Overall, the huge volatility in bitcoin price has reduced its market capitalization to $171 billion. From its all-time high of $332 billion, this is a loss of almost half of its value. Although analysts are impressed by innovative blockchain technologies, the future of bitcoin depends highly on regulatory requirements. Several countries have begun deliberating about cryptocurrency regulations. >> The Uk and France are in talks to implement cryptocurrency regulations. Along with regulatory concerns and poor feedback from major analysts, the efficiency of bitcoin blockchain technology has significantly impacted the price. Stripe has announced an end to its support for the coin, while several other companies including MoneyGram, MercuryFX, and others have begun supporting Ripple’s xRapid product instead. Facebook has now also announced to ban ads promoting digital currencies, binary options, and initial coin offerings, warning: “They’re frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices.” The bitcoin crash amplified further since the start of this week, due to reports that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission sent subpoenas to Bitfinex and Tether, who claimed that the coin is backed by the dollar. Moreover, lower trading volume from South Korean markets after the implementations of new rules has added to traders concerns. The U.S. government has been showing their concerns for fake ICO’s; a number of companies are announcing initial coin offerings to raise the money without any business behind it. Useless Ethereum took the crypto market by storm last week, despite being totally useless. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced a strong crackdown on the illegal use of cryptocurrencies and fake ICO’s. The U.S. SEC has also announced to freeze all the assets of a Texas-based initial coin offering that claimed to have raised more than $600million. So, despite the many reasons behind bitcoin value halving in January, what do you think? Is there room for a comeback? Featured Image: Depositphotos/© rastudio"
1," The Free Software Foundation has recently received a 91.45 BTC (roughly USD 1 million) donation from the anonymous founder of the Pineapple Fund, the Foundation tweeted to express their thanks. The Free Software Foundation is a nonprofit organization striving for computer user freedom  to study the code, distribute, create, and modify computer software, as opposed to leaving them subject to the whim of those who create the software they use.  The Pineapple Fund is a philanthropic project by an anonymous individual nicknamed “Pine” to give away 5,057 Bitcoins to charity (valued at USD 86 million in December 2017, when the fund was announced on Reddit). Pine claims to be among the 250 largest holders of Bitcoin in the world. The fund has already donated over USD 34 million to 41 organizations, all in BTC, to organizations providing clean water to people in Sub-Saharan Africa, to a basic income experiment that will help rural Kenyans trapped in extreme poverty, to a non-profit created to build an Internet library, to support universal health care, research and treatments for aging, education for disadvantaged children worldwide, and to provide stable housing worldwide. The fund is currently matching any donations sent to MAPS, an organization supporting research for treatments for mental illness, and to the Erowid Center, an educational organization providing free information on psychoactive plants and drugs. Donations sent to MAPS will be matched up to USD 4 million, while donations sent to the Erowid Center will be matched up to USD 250,000 until March 10."
1," Electronics giant Samsung has begun manufacturing ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) chips designed for Bitcoin mining for a Chinese client, according to the local media reports. The publication states that the process for the development of semiconductor ASIC was completed last year, and that mass production has started in January. “We are in the middle of a foundry business that is being supplied to a virtual money mining company in China,” a Samsung spokesperson confirmed, adding that the company was unsure how profitable the venture would prove to be. Taiwanese hardware giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company supplies the ASIC chips needed for cryptocurrency mining to Bitmain, a China-based Bitcoin mining company, and is the only other major semiconductor manufacturer to form a partnership with a Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer. Last year, Samsung used 40 old Galaxy phones to create a Bitcoin mining rig as part of an “upcycling” initiative intended to persuade customers to find new use cases for their old phones. The rig, of course, was mostly a curiosity, but it is an interesting development given that, according to this new information, Samsung was secretly developing ASIC chips at the time. This shows that chip manufacturers like Samsung are well aware of the prevalent use of their GPUs (graphics processing unit) for cryptocurrency mining by end users, and might be even focusing it with new designs. For example, only a few days ago, it was revealed that Nvidia was trying to prevent crypto miners from getting their hands on their products, in order to protect their gamer clientele."
0," Judd Gregg and Bitcoin (BTC). Should we also compare bitcoin to gold? The former New Hampshire Governor thinks so. There have been a number of prominent leaders joining in on the conversation surrounding the cryptocurrency industry lately. Last week, we heard from Howard Schultz, the chairman of Starbucks. Schultz stated that while he is a fan of cryptocurrency, he does not like bitcoin. Who do you agree with? Yesterday, The Hill published an opinion piece that featured the three-term senator. Gregg is cited as saying that he strongly believes that bitcoin, a virtual currency, has the potential to change the way that the world views currency.  In the exchange with The Hill, Judd Gregg compared bitcoin to gold. This comparison has been done a number of times both this year and last year. However, this time, Gregg stated that gold has value because it is accepted by banks, while bitcoin is only supported by shareholders beliefs.  >> Read More About What People Are Saying About Bitcoin When it comes to commercial transactions, Gregg stated that bitcoin has the potential to alter how the world views these transactions. It’s not entirely surprising that Gregg has come forward with this view, considering there are a number of politicians now coming to terms with the possibilities of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.  It’s not just Gregg and Schultz who have come forward with their views on bitcoin. From Katy Perry to Joseph Stiglitz, it seems everyone has something to say about the cryptocurrency sector. Not only that, but there have been a number of companies who have made a move into the blockchain technology industry. This is a cause for concern for some, as there is a decent amount of people who fear that people are investing in both bitcoin and blockchain without having a 100% grasp of the industries.  >> More Prominent Leaders Who Have Opened Up About Cryptocurrency Regardless of what people think, however, the industry seems to have a mind of its own. One moment you think bitcoin is going to keep climbing, and the next you think of it as a bubble that is bound to burst any minute. No matter what people say, we never really know who to believe. At least, not yet.  Featured Image: wmur.com"
0," Social Media Giant Facebook Bans Cryptocurrency Ads In what comes as a somewhat unsurprising move, social media giant Facebook has now banned all ads that promote cryptocurrencies — including bitcoin and ICOs — to protect its users from deceptive financial products and services.  Source: Facebook As a result of Facebook’s new policy, we won’t be able to see ads featuring people like “crypto genius” James Altucher, who has been featured in the media quite prominently because of his endorsement of the digital currency. Recently, Facebook has been a target of heavy criticism for hosting dubious ads that look to promote cryptocurrency. Some of these ads could potentially be associated with scams that are seemingly ubiquitous all over the internet right now. Many have pointed out that these ads use “fake information” to trick investors into putting money into “initial coin offerings”. >>BitConnect Officially Shuts Down — Ponzi Scheme Confirmed? Facebook is certainly not the only platform to host fraudulent promotions.  Recently, some investors were hoodwinked into buying a digital coin supposedly promoted by John McAfee — founder of cybersecurity firm McAfee — through his “official Twitter account”, only to find out later that the “tweet” they saw was actually sent from a bogus Twitter account with an almost identical Twitter handle as McAfee’s official one. This was just one of a myriad of cases where people got hoaxed into buying cryptocurrencies and became victims of such schemes in recent months. >>Nigerians Are Using An Old Approach To Beat Bitcoin Scams In its latest blog post, Facebook provided the following statement: “We want people to continue to discover and learn about new products and services through Facebook ads without fear of scams or deception. That said, there are many companies who are advertising binary options, ICOs and cryptocurrencies that are not currently operating in good faith.”  Today’s announcement marks another critical step in Facebook’s pathway to clean up its platform. Over the past few weeks, Facebook already made significant changes to its News Feed, aiming to filter out untrustworthy news sources while boosting local news outlets and posts from friends and family. Time will tell how effective Facebook’s new policy will be in protecting its users from more cryptocurrency scams, but this is definitely good news for the Facebook audience. Featured Image: Twitter"
0," Bitcoin (BTC) price grew in the second half of 2017. The digital currency peaked above $19,000 at the end of last year but, lost nearly half of its value in the new few weeks. Bitcoin continues to trade in a narrow range over the last two weeks is currently trading around the $11,000 mark. Traders blame the lack of regulation for the huge plunge in prices, however, they are ignoring the growth in bitcoin miners and the decline in the cost of production. >> Hackers are Mining Cryptocurrency using Video Websites Mining is a lucrative business that doesn’t require intellectual property or specific knowledge, so it is now advantageous for arbitrageurs to easily mine bitcoin.  And thanks to low regulatory requirements, several new players are entering the mining markets. For instance, CryptoWatt, LLC, recently announced the purchase of MSE Technologies’ grounds and buildings in order to transform them into a mining operation likely to begin this March. Moreover, technology companies are making mining easier by developing chips for specifically for it. The low entry barrier will allow more arbitrageurs to start mining and this will substantially increase supply, beginning the decline of bitcoin miner’s profitability. The result will be modest profits against the cost of mining. Chairman and CEO Thomas Peterffy said, “a sharp bitcoin price decline could cause liquidity issues for the clearinghouses that could spread across financial markets and lead to a Lehman-style collapse.” >> The Next Global Hotspots for Bitcoin Mining Energy consumption is the major cost. Mining a single coin is eventually determined by how much the electricity spend is on operating a mining rig. Based on an Elite Fixture survey, South America has the potential to mine a single coin for $531. Venezuela is among those countries that offer the cheapest cost to mine altcoins. On the other hand, South Korea, driven by higher electricity costs, is the most expensive country to mine bitcoin. Featured Image: twitter"
0," A British man has been forced to hand over Bitcoin (BTC) at gunpoint in what is the first armed cryptocurrency theft in the country, say reports. Danny Aston, 30, called the police to his home in Moulsford, Oxfordshire, at 9:40 am GMT on Monday after four masked robbers forced entry. The robbers reportedly demanded that Mr. Aston, an ex-financier-turned-Bitcoin-trader, transfer an unknown amount of Bitcoin to them before leaving the scene. No-one was injured in the event. Though the exact amount transferred has not been specified, it could be very large due to the nature of Mr. Aston’s work which involves his company: Aston Digital Currencies Ltd. >> Beware of the Bitcoin ATMs One mother told British newspaper The Mail on Sunday that she saw “Four young men in black tracksuits” approach Mr. Ashton’s property that day. Shortly after the incident, a local school was temporarily placed on lockdown as a police helicopter scoured the area, according to the Daily Mail. Thames Valley Police are asking for witnesses to come forward to aid in the thieves’ arrest, which will surely prove to be a challenge since Bitcoin is designed to be untraceable. Though this news is unprecedented in the UK, and especially in a small Oxfordshire town, it is not the first time that an armed cryptocurrency heist has taken place. Canadian police are searching for two suspects involved in a cryptocurrency exchange robbery on Tuesday 23rd January. Three people, armed with handguns, stormed the offices of Canadian Bitcoins in Ottawa, Ontario, in an attempt to force employees to transfer funds. The suspects fled, and one of them caught, after police were called by an employee who remained hidden, said CBC news. It is not clear whether the suspects wanted Bitcoin specifically, regular funds transferred, or physical cash. >> 2017 Was the Year of the ICO but What Will Happen to ICOs in 2018? The prospect of increasing cryptocurrency crime, especially physical robberies, won’t do much to inhibit the swathes of regulatory action being implemented by governments around the world. China, South Korea, France, and Russia are all mulling over ways to control the growing phenomenon of digital currency, and this is having a negative impact on market prices. Plus, with most cryptocurrencies being pretty much untraceable, police forces are going to have to reconsider the way they approach the issue. If you are in the UK and have any information you can call Thames Valley Police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. If you have any information on the Ottawa robbery, call the robbery unit on 613-236-1222 or Crime Stoppers anonymously on 1-800-222-8477. Featured image: Caribbean National Weekly"
0," The price of Bitcoin (BTC) increased sharply over the weekend and hit a high of $12,000 on Sunday. The jump from Friday’s low of $10,400 was short-lived however as the market was suddenly hit by the Coincheck hack resulting in the theft of $530 million worth of NEM coins (NEM). Bitcoin price has been volatile since the start of this year but the latest hack may have damaged faith in the cryptocurrency even further. Although the Coincheck management ensures a refund of almost $425 million, Japan’s Financial Services Agency has raised questions over whether Coincheck actually has enough funds for the compensation. The hack has not only exposed the security of the entire cryptocurrency markets, it has also raised concerns about regulatory requirements. >> Many countries, including France, are planning to issue cryptocurrency regulations Japan’s Financial Services Agency announced on Monday that they will check the security measures of each cryptocurrency exchange. The agency has also ordered Coincheck to improve security measures. Coincheck said, “The NEM coins were stored in a “hot wallet” instead of the more secure “cold wallet,” outside of the internet.”  The broader sell-off was observed throughout Monday trade, thanks to additional concerns related to Tether. Cryptocurrencies started struggling after Coindesk reported that Tether had parted ways with its auditors. As a result, trader concerns have now been raised over whether Tether has artificially raised their value, which they said had been backed by the dollars. Nicholas Weaver – a professor at UC Berkeley’s International Computer Science Institute, said that a “true bloodbath” is likely if Tether couldn’t prove their value in actual dollars. He said: “At current prices, net new Bitcoin requires $18million of net new dollars flowing in to maintain the price… Yet there is a net $100million a day of fake dollars in the form of Tethers.” Bitcoin is trading at around $11,378 at the time of writing, down 4% from the previous day. On Monday trade, Ethereum (ETC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and several other digital currencies will be struggling to trade in the green. Analysts expect the Bitcoin price to plunge 80% amid Tether concerns, regulatory concerns from South Africa and the Philippines, and from other major countries likely to cap the upside potential of digital currencies.   >> The UK may implement new cryptocurrency regulations also.

0," Two Bitcoin traders were robbed at gunpoint at their home in rural England when armed criminals forced them to carry out cryptocurrency transfers, the Telegraph reported. Danny Aston and his girlfriend Amy Jay, who jointly run a cryptocurrency trading company called Aston Digital Currencies Ltd, were forced to digitally transfer an unspecified amount of Bitcoin by four men who broke into their house. The incident took place on January 22, but was first reported almost a week later. The Mail on Sunday reported that the men tied up a woman and kept a baby outside in a pram while forcing Mr Aston to transfer the Bitcoin.  According to The Times newspaper, Aston has carried out more than 100,000 cryptocurrency trades with more than 16,300 different accounts, and offers trading tips and analysis online. The publication also reported that some of his clients referred to him by his real name, which may have helped thieves identify him. A police spokesman said, ""The investigation is in its early stages; however, initial enquiries suggest this may be a targeted incident.” The anonymity of Bitcoin will make it almost impossible to trace, but Guy Shone, chief executive of Explain The Market, said: “[...] depending on how much [Bitcoin] they have, these coins are like being in possession of a rare painting. Trying to exchange large amounts for [fiat] money without alerting suspicion will be very difficult.’  All public profiles of Danny Aston have since been deleted and, according to their neighbors, the couple now seems to be hiding at a secret address since the robbery occurred."
0," Coming as perhaps the most blatant sign that the world is currently in the grip of a cryptocurrency mania, the sci-fi action-role-playing-game Imperatum gave itself a ""Bitcoin Mode"" as part of its latest update.  Made by indie developers Pro Social Games, the title now provides its players with the option of linking its fundamental dynamics to real-time movements in the price of bitcoin. With Bitcoin Mode chosen at the start of a new game, players will find that a rise (or fall) in bitcoin's value will confront them with more (or less) ""loot"" and with more (or less) fearsome enemies. Summing up these new features, Pro Social Games' founder Andrew Stafford told Cryptonews.com what would happen if bitcoin should ever crash to zero USD per coin: ""If this happened the enemies would drop to the lowest possible level, which in our case is 1."" Asked whether a bitcoin value of USD 100,000 would make the game ridiculously hard, Stafford replies: ""Yes, enemies would scale to the highest possible level in the game and would make life tough for the player."" While the current volatility of bitcoin could therefore make for some interesting gaming, it's clear that much of the rationale behind the decision to add a Bitcoin Mode is promotional.  ""This is the first step in drawing the interest of the crypto community,"" Stafford explains. ""Blockchain is a very new thing to a lot of people and Bitcoin is the big name that draws them."" Pro Social wouldn't be the first company to exploit bitcoin or the blockchain's reputation for commercial gain: in December, the shares of Long Island Ice Tea Corp. rose by 432% in a single day after the American soft-drinks company changed its name to Long Blockchain Corporation. That said, Stafford also confirmed that the developer's interest in cryptocurrency isn't focused only on PR.  ""We have big plans in the works for the implementation of our own cryptocurrency that drops in game,"" he reveals. How such a cryptocurrency might work wasn't outlined, yet Stafford was able to give some hint as to why Pro Social would be developing its own cryptocurrency rather than deepening its relationship with bitcoin.  ""I do not see a future for Bitcoin,"" he admits. ""Bitcoin doesn't do anything the best and will eventually be supplanted by gen. 2, 3, 4 cryptocurrencies. Whether this happens this year or not is up for debate."""
0," Bitcoin and altcoins rose during the past 2-3 days and moved into a positive zone. However, cryptocurrencies faced sellers on the topside and started a downside correction. On the fundamental front, it seems like trouble is mounting on Tether. The company recently confirmed that their relationship with audit firm Friedman LLP has ended. In a statement, the company mentioned: 
“We confirm that the relationship with Friedman is dissolved.  Given the excruciatingly detailed procedures Friedman was undertaking for the relatively simple balance sheet of Tether, it became clear that an audit would be unattainable in a reasonable time frame.” “We confirm that the relationship with Friedman is dissolved.  Given the excruciatingly detailed procedures Friedman was undertaking for the relatively simple balance sheet of Tether, it became clear that an audit would be unattainable in a reasonable time frame.” It all started with a post from an anonymous blogger, who raised concerns about USDT. There are rising alarms whether every USDT token indeed have a dollar sitting in bank accounts. The blogger Bitfinex’ed, summarized the post saying: 
“Bitfinex will never submit to a third party audit, because they know what they will find. This could have also been a factor in their refusal to go through a traditional bankruptcy. The bankruptcy trustee would have found out Bitfinex could have been cooking the books since the day they started and the losses would have been way more significant.” “Bitfinex will never submit to a third party audit, because they know what they will find. This could have also been a factor in their refusal to go through a traditional bankruptcy. The bankruptcy trustee would have found out Bitfinex could have been cooking the books since the day they started and the losses would have been way more significant.” If all the ongoing drama continues, there are chances that bitcoin price could decline. USDT has a lot of weightage in trading cryptocurrencies. If something bad happens down the line, then altcoins could face a lot of selling pressure. On the other hand, South African Revenue Service (Sars) said to be working in tax structure for bitcoins and digital currencies with their plans to examine cryptocurrencies space much more cautiously. In addition, Bonnie Cheung, a venture partner at 500 Startups thinks that bitcoin is boring. While speaking to Bloomberg, Cheung compared bitcoin with a Motorola cell phone. She added: “The three key areas are right now scalability if you look at throughput Visa does about on average 2,000 transactions per second. PayPal can do around 500, bitcoin it’s seven, ethereum maxing out at about 50.” Clearly, she is referring to capacity and scalability problems of bitcoin. BTCUSD was down from the USD 12,200 high and is currently trading lower by 4.10% to USD 11,420. Ethereum too suffered losses and was down by 2.65% to trade near USD 1,200. However, ETHUSD remains supported on the downside near the USD 1,180 and USD 1,160 support levels.  Bitcoin price is currently under pressure and there is a possibility of it testing the USD 11,100 support zone. Below USD 11,100, the price could break the USD 11,000 level for further declines. On the upside, there is a strong resistance near USD 12,000 and USD 12,100. Other altcoins such as litecoin and ripple started a downside correction after an upside move. LTCUSD is currently down by 2.9% at USD 183.  Overall, the market is in a short-term correction mode. However, BTCUSD must stay above USD 11,100 to avoid further slides."
1," 2017 was the breakout year for cryptocurrency. Starting at the beginning of the year, the total market cap for all cryptocurrencies was just over $17 billion and at the end of December, it reached just under $600 billion. Bitcoin (BTC), the original cryptocurrency, from the year 2013 to the beginning of 2017, held almost 90% dominance of the total market.  Currently, BTC only holds 34.4% dominance. As cryptocurrency gained mainstream attention, Bitcoin slowly started losing the market cap dominance as individuals started buying up the less expensive coins to get their hands in the market. 2018 is shaping up to be the year of the altcoins, as you can see from the chart below. Bitcoin’s growth has slowed since it’s Bitcoin futures contracts launched on two Wall Street exchanges, mid-December. I would like to add, however, that BTC is still up over 1100% for the year in growth. Many who got in early investing in Bitcoin, made a serious profit last year. More BTC News >>  Source: CoinMarketCap As investors seek the “next Bitcoin”, Ethereum has held slow dominance. It was passed by Ripple (XRP) briefly two times in a years time, in May of 17′ and a week and a half ago. However, currently, it remains the clear second on the market by almost $60 billion. Both development teams on Bitcoin and the Ethereum network are facing the same issue, scalability. Transaction times on the Bitcoin blockchain have slowed exponentially and yesterday transaction times were around 2,000 minutes. The current fees associated with withdrawing Bitcoin and converting it to your fiat currency on Coinbase is currently around 60% (BTC/CAD). This is to cover the cost of the slow transaction time and the high fee. Bitcoin.org has even changed their website’s language, as you can see from the comparison photo below. The lightning network is the project that is supposed to speed up the current Bitcoin blockchain, by adding a “layer” to the top of it for micropayments. Its current test net is running and it is being used but has endured several bug issues. ETH News >>  Source: CCN Ethereum’s main development team is working on scaling the Ethereum blockchain by way of quadratic “sharding.” In a Github post posted two days ago, the founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, points out the specs as to what sharding will look like. He held a developer meeting recently and anticipated that the fourth phase should be completed “in a month and a bit.” “Then from there we’re going to try and shard it into a working test, a kind of test network,” Vitalik said. If the Ethereum team can get this up and functioning faster than the lightning network, this could mean big things for the cryptocurrency.

0," Imagine buying your favorite Starbucks beverage with cryptocurrency on your way to work each morning. This could well be happening in the future. During the company’s earnings call on Thursday, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) Chairman Howard Schultz provided his own personal view on the “fast brewing” cryptocurrency market, fully backing the potential and practicality of digital coins in the future. Starbucks in Argentina caught mining on customers’ laptops>> According to Schultz, there will be one or a few legitimate digital currencies based on the blockchain technology that consumers will be able to trust. “I’m talking about […] the possibility of what could happen — not in the near term, but in a few years from now — with a consumer application in which there’s trust and legitimacy with regard to a digital currency.” However, Schultz’s version of a digital currency world excludes Bitcoin, the No. 1 cryptocurrency right now. Like many business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos had mentioned this week, the Starbucks executive does not consider Bitcoin to be a legitimate currency. “I don’t believe that bitcoin is going to be a currency today or in the future. I’m talking about the new technology of blockchain and the possibility of what could happen not in the near terms, but in a few years from now,” added Schultz. 5 cryptocurrencies under $5>> Despite being confident in the technology, Schultz reiterated that his company has no specific plans to launch its own cryptocurrency right now and it’s still trying to understand the crypto world. Even so, we can’t rule out the possibility that Starbucks may test out a virtual currency in the near future, as today’s statements pretty much confirm that the company is headed in that direction. This is not the first time Schultz has brought up the idea of a cashless payment system. In a CNBC interview last month, he mentioned that he could envision a future where the coffee chain becomes a “cashless retailer” and believes “that time is nearer than you think.” Read about the largest crypto hack ever>> Featured Image: Twitter "
0," Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital currencies started gaining popularity last year following the big tech companies’ interest in blockchain technologies. Moreover, cryptocurrencies’ ability to execute transactions semi-anonymously has added to the popularity. Consequently, people who want their transactions to be hard to trace enjoy the secrecy these digital currencies offer. According to researchers from the University of Sydney, almost 44% of Bitcoin transactions were used for illegal purposes and 25% of all traders used Bitcoin for illicit reasons. The research further shows that these Bitcoin traders are expected to make close to 36 million transactions each year. Do KYCs make the crypto market unfair? >> “Our paper suggests that a significant component of the intrinsic value of bitcoin as a payment system derives from its use in facilitating illegal trade,” the researcher said. The researchers’ findings certainly seem true. The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has declined from $830 billion to around $550 billion in the last couple of weeks, driven down by regulatory concerns that may, in part, be resulting from this illegal activity. Beware the Bitcoin ATM >> Bitcoin is currently selling at $10,922 after briefly dipping below the $10,000 mark on regulatory worries last week. The latest selloff has reduced Bitcoin’s total market capitalization to $183 billion, down significantly from the all-time high of $330 billion.   On the other hand, several fund managers believe the movement in Bitcoin price is purely based on speculation and that the coin does not have any underlying value or future fundamentals. The chief executive of Vanguard, Tim Buckley,  said, “Bitcoin’s value is based off scarcity, an artificial scarcity that’s out there.” He further added, “It’s really tough to imagine where the long-term returns come from, other than speculation.” 5 cryptocurrencies under $5 >> Ripple (XRP) is among those cryptocurrencies that are likely to create its own underlying value. Ripple continues to make partnerships with payment services companies to improve their transaction time and reduce the transaction charges. After the announcement of the partnership with MoneyGram,  IDT Corporation and Mercury FX are planning to use Ripple’s xRapid product for certain transactions.

0," Cryptocurrencies were under pressure during the past few hours and bitcoin price traded below the USD 11,000 support. Ethereum also faced selling pressure and traded below the USD 1,050 support. Commenting on regulation issues, one of the most senior financial policymakers in the US raised concerns over the recent rise in bitcoin price and people using it in criminal activities -""illicit activity"". Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, US treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, stated that ""we want to make sure that they're not used for illicit activities”. Similarly, Theresa May raised issues of rising use of cryptocurrencies. The US follows strict rules and laws to ensure that exchanges in the US which are offering trades in bitcoin and digital currencies follow all important anti-money laundering rules. However, there are many countries which are still very far in cracking down bitcoin and altcoins.  Bitcoin price was in trouble today as it traded lower by more than 6.8% to USD 10,580. It broke an important support at USD 11,000, which has cleared the path for more declines. ETH also was under pressure along with NEO and LTC. Litecoin was down by 6.4% to trade near USD 170. Bitcoin cash also suffered losses as it traded close to the USD 1500 level.  In a surprising statement, cryptocurrency 'Oracle' Lingham in an interview to CNBC stated that he thinks bitcoin cash may overtake bitcoin in the near future. He added saying: ""When I look at it from the product standpoint, I think the greater demand is for peer-to-peer cash than for digital gold”. In altcoins arena,ICON Mainnet Launch was a huge success. ICX is one of the most talked about altcoins lately. One of the other altcoins, DigixDAO, gained heavily today. DGD was up by around 48% to trade above the USD 275 level. Overall, the market is struggling to gain bullish strength. The recent bounce in bitcoin and Ethereum seems to be fading. If prices fail to recover during the coming sessions, there can be more declines in BTC/USD toward USD 10,000, and ETH/USD could trade below USD 1,000."
0," Last month, Bitcoin was used in a freight deal sent from Rostov, Russia to Samsun, Turkey, according to a firm called Prime Shipping Foundation (PSF). Possibly, this is the first freight deal done in a cryptocurrency, per Bloomberg. PSF is trying to develop “a cross-border payment system that’s easier and faster than what’s available now”, Bloomberg reported, citing PSF’s Chief Executive Officer Ivan Vikulov.  Vikulov hopes the company’s trial can lead to processing freight deals more fluidly through cryptocurrency usage. During the research and development of the project, PSF has partnered with Quorum Capital and Interchart LLC, a ship management service. According to Bloomberg, “Prime Shipping Foundation is seeking to get a banking license in Gibraltar, one of the most crypto-friendly jurisdictions”, in order to make conversions between fiat and crypto easier. Because of crypto’s market volatility, Vikulov said they would allow hedging. They are developing their own cryptocurrency, with plans to raise funds for it mid-2018. This comes soon after the announcement that Louis Dreyfus Co. teamed up with Dutch and French banks to use blockchain in the agricultural commodity trade. A blockchain platform was used to sell a cargo of soybeans to Shandong Bohi Industry Co., based in China, Bloomberg reported. Cryptocurrency in the freight industry is not exactly news: a project called Blockfreight uses both the Bitcoin and the Ethereum blockchain while also utilizing the InterPlanetary File System protocol within the global supply chain. Blockfreight’s CEO Julian Smith said for news.bitcoin.com that he “believes supply chain dealers won’t even know bitcoin will be running beneath the system.”"

It’s all consolidated,” said Baiju Bhatt, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Robinhood, alongside Vlad Tenev. Ever since its launch in 2015, the platform has become a staple equity trading app for U.S. investors, especially among the younger generation. Now that it is offering free crypto trading, Robinhood’s popularity is bound to skyrocket, possibly overtaking leading exchange Coinbase in the near future. According to Bhatt, Robinhood’s consumer base has grown to more than three million users with a transaction volume of about $100 billion. For a comparison, Coinbase has 13 million customers globally. The latest TRON news >> “We’re planning to operate this business on a break-even basis and we don’t plan to profit from it for the foreseeable future,” concluded Tenev. “We’re an established company and we can handle it.” Side note: For those wondering, the Robinhood platform is unrelated to the Cobinhood (COB) coin or the app. In fact, Robinhood had previously sent a cease-and-desist to Cobinhood for using a similar name.

The reviews online are overwhelmingly negative; however, it must not be forgotten that the purpose of these ratings is to “help protect investors from risk, while leading them to the most sustainable, robust cryptocurrencies”, as it says in their statement on why Bitcoin is not an A. The Weiss ratings placed ethereum and EOS cryptocurrencies ahead of bitcoin, as reported by Cryptonews.com today. No currency garnered a top score of A, but there were B ratings for both ethereum and EOS, with bitcoin receiving a “fair” rating of C+. Weiss claimed bitcoin “falls short in two important areas: risk and technology,” although it admitted bitcoin was strong in terms of adoption and branding.  Reddit, an American news aggregation and discussion website, user u/CrzyJek has taken to the popular r/cryptocurrency subreddit to explain why Weiss ratings “is a sham and complete utter garbage”. The user cites his sources diligently, quoting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in their prosecutions of Weiss for “fraudulent, misleading statements, as well as engaging in insider pump & dump though their listings”.  Those sources were a cease and desist letter from 2006, and an order approving distribution plan from 2009. He concludes that, “Weiss ratings is a long standing pump & dump operation who makes propitious picks based largely on which securities the owners currently hold, and who, prima facia [sic], had a few years of self-proclaimed legitimacy, yet were later exposed as shilling their own picks to pump their stocks.” Other users on the same subreddit urge against taking the Weiss ratings seriously: “If the reports are freely available read them and analyze their findings but don't take them as gospel. Give them a credibility level similar to a well researched blog post [...] I suspect that [the reports] are mostly a PR stunt to increase the visibility of Weiss Ratings and maybe sell some subscriptions/reports.” Reddit User u/atworkmeir proposes to “take it with several grains of salt. Maybe the whole shaker.” As this is the first cryptocurrency rating available, it must be taken into consideration that perhaps, Weiss holds the cryptocurrency market to the same standards as the stock market, even though they are not strictly comparable, at least for the moment. Weiss said, “Ratings are not a science. They are, and always will be, a work in progress.” In addition to the negative reviews, Weiss has been hit with a spate of cyberattacks it says came “from Korea”, also as reported by Cryptonews.com."
1," It has been well known that Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz is not a big fan of bitcoin. At the World Economic Forum annual meeting taking place this week in Davos, Switzerland, he told Bloomberg reporters that bitcoin serves no function other than being useful in illicit activities such as money laundering and tax evasion. Just yesterday, Bill Browder spoke out about the ‘death of bitcoin‘! His rationale is based on his belief that bitcoin is no better than the dollar as a medium of exchange, and the cryptocurrency is basically there to solve a problem that never existed. “We have a good medium of exchange called the dollar,” stated Stiglitz. “We can trade in that. Why do people want bitcoin? For secrecy.“ The economist explained that the global banking system is already implementing digital payment technologies, so having bitcoin is just unnecessary. On top of reiterating his aversion for the cryptocurrency, Stiglitz also called for bitcoin to be regulated. “My feeling is that when you regulate it so that you couldn’t engage in money laundering and all these other things, there would be no demand for bitcoin,” he added. “So by regulating the abuses, you are going to regulate it out of existence.” Stiglitz was also joined by Swiss National Bank chairman Thomas Jordan, who gave a speech on why tough restrictions should be placed on bitcoin. “There is an important principle: Similar activities should be similarly regulated, and bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have some characteristics of other investment instruments,” Jordan told listeners. In a previous interview conducted in November 2017, Stiglitz condemned the cryptocurrency and said it was “successful only because of its potential for circumvention [and] lack of oversight.” Stiglitz is only one of many famous economists to be super skeptical of bitcoin. Last year, Robert Shiller, another Nobel Prize winner, described bitcoin as “the best example of a bubble” and considered its valuation “exceptionally ambiguous.” Here’s what others in the financial world are saying about bitcoin.

1," Those who follow the music industry know that Curtis Jackson — better known by his stage name 50 Cent — was at one time considered one of the most successful and wealthy rappers on the planet. But little do we know is that some of his vast wealth (despite controversies surrounding his bankruptcy filing in 2015) can now be attributed to bitcoin. Back in 2014, 50 Cent became the first in the industry to accept bitcoin as payment for his album “Animal Ambition.” At that time, bitcoin was valued only around $662 per BTC. According to a report by TMZ, 50 Cent collected approximately 700 bitcoins from album sales — equivalent to about $420,000. In an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session on Reddit following the album release, 50 Cent talked about accepting bitcoin as a way to “stay with the times.” Seeing how bitcoin’s value shot up over the past year, we can probably guess how much money the rapper has made since acquiring the coins. Even at a floor price of $10,000 per BTC, 50 Cent’s coins would have a value of $7 million. Essentially, he has made millions of dollars from collecting bitcoins from his 2014 album sale. 50 Cent has been known for making shrewd investments in the past. Over a decade ago, the rapper bought a minority stake in Vitamin Water, which was subsequently acquired by Coca-Cola for $4.1 billion in 2007. 50 Cent reportedly walked away with somewhere between $60 million and $100 million from that deal. Delighted by the latest revelation, 50 Cent even posted a screenshot of the TMZ article on his Instagram feed. Commenting on the Instagram post, he wrote: “Not Bad for a kid from South Side, I’m so proud of me.”  Given that bitcoin hasn’t been doing too well lately and its price is still volatile, it might be a good idea for him to cash out while the opportunity is there, as suggested by TMZ.

1," Sander Wuyts, a PhD student from the University of Antwerp, has won the DNA Storage Bitcoin Challenge, issued by Nick Goldman of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) in 2015, the Institute reports. However, Wuyts is skeptical as to the value of Bitcoin. “I didn’t win thousands of euros, I won one Bitcoin,” he says. “I will probably cash it out, because I have my doubts about the long-term value of this cryptocurrency”. One of his followers on Twitter reacted to this: 
“You will regret it a lot in the future if you sell it. Look at it this way: it is worth less than 10k now. That's just a few months of pay for your level of education. It's meaningless. But what if you are wrong about its future? Then it will make a difference”.  The challenge had been issued on January 21, 2015, at a World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland. The deadline was to be January 21, 2018 - exactly three years later. In that time, the price of Bitcoin increased from USD 230 to c. USD 10,000, as at the press time. At the meeting, Goldman explained a new method of storing digital information in DNA. To prove the merit of this, Goldman distributed test tubes containing samples of DNA encoding one Bitcoin to the audience (and subsequently posted samples to people who requested them). The first person to read the DNA and decode the files it contained could take possession of the Bitcoin. According to the Institute, “all they needed was the sample, access to a DNA sequencing machine and a grasp of how the code works.” Wuyts, the PhD student who won the challenge, only started working on it after seeing a tweet about the deadline in early December 2017. The hard work paid off with only a week to go before time was up: on January 16, he published a blog post on cracking the code, with step-by-step, highly technical explanations. You can watch the full speech from the WEF meeting in 2015 on this link."
0,"  Source: Stripe Online payment processor Stripe announced on Twitter today that it will no longer support Bitcoin (BTC) payments on its platform, citing ‘fewer and fewer use cases for which accepting or paying with Bitcoin makes sense’. Stripe product manager Tom Karlo released a gentle-yet-cutting blog post this afternoon outlining the company’s decision to break up with the world’s largest cryptocurrency. ‘Over the past year or two,’ he explains, ‘Bitcoin has evolved to become better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange.’ Not entirely useful for a payment application, therefore. Karlo goes on to explain that ‘substantially’ higher transaction times and an increase in failure rates have led to a decrease in customer desire to use the coin on the Stripe platform. Ouch. >>Bitcoin Now In ‘Bubble Territory’, Warns Goldman Sachs This is in stark contrast to four years ago when Stripe made headlines after announcing it would be the first major online payment platform with Bitcoin integration back in March 2014. The news comes amid a turbulent couple of weeks which has seen the cryptocurrency market as a whole take a beating. Governments have begun introducing legislation to regulate digital currency trading, causing investors to step back. But don’t start writing a furious e-mail just yet. For those of you who trade frequently with Bitcoin via Stripe, there is still plenty of time to make some last-minute transactions. The company is entering a ‘wind-down’ phase with Bitcoin support, working with affected users to ensure a ‘smooth transition’ before they stop processing the currency completely on April 23rd, 2018. In addition, Stripe remain ‘very optimistic about cryptocurrencies overall’, and suggest that they are interested in enabling support for ‘promising’ cryptocurrency efforts in the future. So it’s not all doom and gloom. >>Proof-of-Stake Can Save Cryptocurrency Stripe, like Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL), is an online payment system whereby users can accept transfers online and in mobile apps. The Irish company have business clients around the world and handle billions of dollars per year. It isn’t the first company to decide to start and then stop accepting Bitcoin as a payment method; Valve’s ‘Steam’ gaming platform ended Bitcoin support on December 7th last year amid market volatility. Bitcoin was in the green today after yesterday’s slump, reaching a peak of $11,377.60 USD. Featured Image: Mashable"
0," Most of the world at this point has formed an opinion on digital currency bitcoin (BTC). Not everyone is willing to share their thoughts with the masses, especially about something that is so new and so controversial. Is bitcoin a speculative bubble or is it not? There are different indications every day but, there are others who have pretty strong opinions. Former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair, Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller, and even JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon have all shared their thoughts. So who else is speaking out? The latest to speak out about the virtual currency is Bill Browder, the CEO of Hermitage Capital, which is an investment fund company that focuses primarily on Russian markets. In an interview with CNBC, Mr. Browder stated that he knows what the death of bitcoin will be.  There are a lot of people hoping bitcoin will fail, and there are a lot of people guessing in what way will the cryptocurrency come to the end of its life, and Browder, while not a pessimist, believes that there are a few reasons which suggest that bitcoin will one day come to an end.  In particular, Browder stated that bitcoin is “a way for bad dictators or criminals to bypass sanctions.” Translation? Bitcoin can be incredibly useful when it comes to criminal activity, while, in turn, will be “the death of it and other cryptocurrencies.”  He added that there will come a point in time where cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin, will lose all that makes them so appealing to investors right now.  Browder has a point. Bitcoin, because it is not regulated, is susceptible to money laundering and other sorts of criminal activity, which is why there are certain countries fighting for more regulation over the virtual currency.  Every day is different. Sometimes bitcoin is dropping, other times it looks like it’s making a comeback. Today is the latter.  At the time of writing, bitcoin managed to climb its way above the $11,000 mark today, after dropping marginally in the early hours of the morning.  Personally, it’s hard to say the direction that bitcoin is heading in the next couple weeks. For the sake of investors, I hope that it continues to gain momentum.  Featured Image: Twitter"
0," If you’re an investor anguishing at the performance of bitcoin lately, there may be more bad news on the way. Today, Goldman Sachs issued a warning against the cryptocurrency, affirming that there is “no doubt” that bitcoin’s meteoric rise over the past year has “pushed it into bubble territory.” Goldman Sachs also compared last year’s bitcoin frenzy to the renowned dot-com era of the late 1990s and the Dutch “tulipmania” of the 17th century. The investment banking firm believes that this “bitcoin bubble” could get much bigger than its historical comparables.  Source: MarketWatch Analysts at Goldman Sachs view the extreme price volatility of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin as a big indication that a big crash could be on the cards. They also pointed out that as the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, bitcoin does not actually fulfil the role it sets out to do. In a research report issued to investors, Goldman Sachs analysts stated: “We think the concept of a digital currency that leverages blockchain technology is viable given the benefits it could provide: ease of execution globally, lower transaction costs, reduction of corruption since all transactions could be traced, safety of ownership, and so on. But bitcoin does not provide any of these key advantages.” According to the report, the difference in bitcoin prices between exchanges at the same time could reach as high as $4,000 just because a single bitcoin transaction takes a long time to process. This means a buyer could be paying 31% more for one BTC on one exchange than another. In addition to bitcoin, Goldman Sachs also gave a similar verdict on other cryptocurrencies such as ether and ripple. “While we do not know if bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency will double or triple from prevailing prices, we do not believe that these cryptocurrencies will retain their value in the long run in their current incarnation,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. However, the good news is that Goldman Sachs is still positive about the blockchain technology in general and is considering building a trading platform for bitcoin. As well, analysts do not expect a major crash in bitcoin to cause “major contagion effects on the global economy or financial markets.“ Featured Image: twitter"
0," Bitcoin is an excellent idea that fulfills the needs of the complex system, not because it is a cryptocurrency, but precisely because it has no owner, no authority that can decide on its fate, writes the famous essayist, scholar, and risk analyst Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his foreword to the book by Saifedean Ammous. Bitcoin is owned by the crowd, its users and it has now a track record of several years, enough for it to be “an animal in its own right”, according to Taleb.  The problem with centralized currency and its subsequent impact as Taleb sees it is that, “not only the expert is not an expert, but he doesn’t know it. That previous Federal Reserve bosses, Greenspan and Bernanke, had little grasp of empirical reality is something we only discovered a bit too late [...] which is why we need to be careful on who to endow with centralized macro decisions.” Taleb further concludes that Bitcoin’s structural design is what could make “a zero intelligence crowd [work] better than a Soviet-style management composed to maximally intelligent humans.”  He does not reject the notion that Bitcoin might fail - but is positive in his belief that, should it fail, we, as a society, would simply invent an improved version as an insurance against “an Orwellian future.”"
0," Bitcoin and other major digital currencies came under renewed selling pressure after South Korea’s decision to ban anonymous cryptocurrency trading. The Financial Services Commission in South Korea took a major step and introduced a new rule for cryptocurrency transactions and trading. They banned the use of anonymous bank accounts for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies related trading and transactions.  Speaking at the government complex in Seoul, South Korea, South Korea's Financial Services Commission vice Chair, Kim Yong-Beom, stated that a new system will be introduced soon, which will enable local banks to stop anonymous transactions related to bitcoin trading.  He added that “cryptocurrency exchanges that are in danger of being exploited for money laundering will be thrown out of the market”.  It means these steps will help regulatory firms to prevent money laundering criminal activities in South Korea using bitcoins and cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin price was down roughly 11.88% to USD 10,344. Other major cryptocurrencies also declined sharply, including ether and ripple. ETH traded lower by 12.12% to USD 950. It is now trading below the USD 980 support level and it may continue to decline in the near future. 
The next major support in ETH/USD is at USD 920. Similarly, XRP was down 8.2% to USD 1.24 and is currently holding the USD 1.20 support. Should there be a break below the USD 1.20 support, ripple price could test the USD 1.10 level. Recently in the US, Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Bob Menendez (D-NJ) cautioned Trump administration on Venezuelan Regime's 'petro' cryptocurrency plans. In anopen letter to Secretary Mnuchin, they mentioned: “As such, we are concerned that a cryptocurrency could provide Maduro a mechanism by which to make payments to foreign lenders and bondholders in the United States, actions that would clearly thwart the intent of U.S.-imposed sanctions.” One of the five questions asked by Senators was “Does the Department have effective enforcement mechanisms to follow and counter the use of cryptocurrencies?” Clearly, there is a lot happening in the cryptocurrency arena, putting a lot of pressure on bitcoin price below the USD 11,000 level. Going forward, BTC/USD could test the USD 10,000 level if the current market sentiment fails to ease in the short term."
0," The cryptocurrency market has been in turmoil over the past few days, as governments around the world begin to enforce regulations over coin transfers. Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $10,000 USD on January 17th, for the first time since December 1st (though it is now recovering), and Coinmarketcap has been a sea of red, prompting many reports to describe it as the cryptocurrency ‘bloodbath’. Hyperbolic, maybe, but scary enough if you’ve just invested all the money you were saving up to buy a yacht with.  It’s all very interesting, but amongst all the noise it’s easy to overlook an even more concerning development taking shape within the cryptocurrency industry; one that no amount of smart trading or governmental regulation will fix if we leave it too late.  As we all know, Bitcoins do not come from out of nowhere. Like gold, oil, coal and other valuable commodities, it must be mined. In this case, using computers. And computers tend to use electricity. In fact, according to the Digiconomist’s energy consumption index, Bitcoin mining computers got through around 43.74TWh per year worth of the stuff as of today. To put that into perspective, many members of the Bitcoin community paid some attention to a research paper from UK-based Powercompare last November, which stated that at the time, electricity usage for Bitcoin mining equated to 0.13% of the entire planet’s energy consumption. This is more than the country of Ireland uses per year. It is more than Nigeria, Africa’s largest economy, uses per year. It is more than 159 other countries in the world use per year. ‘If Bitcoin miners were a country’, say Powercompare, ‘they’d rank 61st in the world in terms of energy consumption.’ All of this speaks for itself, but it’s old news. Because at the time the paper was released, Bitcoin’s energy consumption stood at 29.05TWh. That means that since late November 2017, less than two months ago, the amount of power used by Bitcoin mining has increased by 50.5%. That is an unbelievable increase in such a short amount of time, and it’s rising exponentially.  
Uh-oh. Source As of 28th November 2017, Bitcoin energy use had increased by just under 30% that past month. At that rate, it would consume the entire world’s energy supply by 2020. Considering today’s statistic, this is getting alarming.  If environmental issues don’t tend to worry you, consider that not only is this bad for the planet, it’s bad for trading. China’s recent power restrictions on mining operations is putting pressure on miners who want to continue producing coins. Bitmain, one of China’s leading mining companies, is planning on leaving the country and setting up elsewhere due to the regulations. And even if all the miners do move elsewhere, would other countries happily accommodate such high power demand for long? Okay, you get it, it’s a problem. So what do we do about it? The issue with Bitcoin’s protocol is that it uses what’s known as a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm. In essence, this means that every miner must do ‘work’ (using computing power to solve a mathematical problem in order to produce more coins and complete transactions) to add new blocks onto the blockchain system. A block is ‘solved’ every 10 minutes, and out of everyone who tried, only one miner succeeds. They then get the transaction fees and new coins as a reward. The others are informed and their work discarded, despite the colossal power that went into trying to solve the math problem first.  But there is an alternative. Other consensus algorithms, such as proof-of-stake, exist to do essentially the same thing in a different way. With proof-of-stake (PoS), one user (called a ‘forger’ in POS terms) is chosen from a pool to create the next block on the chain, instead of everyone frantically trying to solve a math problem and do it first. This saves an enormous amount of energy. Forgers are chosen based on the stake they have in the system – the number of coins they have and how long they have had them for. They are not rewarded by coins created but they are paid in transaction fees.  And it’s catching on. In fact, some well-known coins with huge market caps have been using PoS for ages. NEO, which normally sits comfortably among the top 10 cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap, currently has a cap of $7.6 billion USD, while the developer-based coin Lisk (LSK) sits on a cap of $2.3 billion USD. Both coins run on a PoS-based algorithm, and, though suffering the same general market price plummet that most cryptocurrencies are, have more value and trading volume than many PoW-based coins. Up-and-coming alt-coins have spotted the benefits of PoS, too. Philosopher Stones (PHS) coins ranked amongst the top three highest gaining coins on January 17th, while reaching a market cap of $1.63m USD later that week, a stunning increase from $459k a couple of days before. Philosopher Stones use the proof-of-stake algorithm as part of their ‘green mining’ initiative, noting that ‘the only equipment you need for minting new coins is your PC or even laptop’. Interestingly, they allow transaction messages on their blockchain network and also offer a 50% year return reward.  Coinmarketcap.com, 17/01/2018 Also, enter EcoCoin (ECO). It is smaller than PHS with a market cap of $235,161 USD but no less ambitious. It, too, uses Proof-of-Stake to validate its transactions. The coin is, in their own words, ‘a cryptocurrency and community focused on protecting and honoring our environment.’ It’s strongly unlikely that this will take the form of storming oil tankers á la Greenpeace, so don’t put off your investments just yet. Since launching, they have made a good deal of progress through their roadmap, establishing Windows and Linux wallets, listing on multiple exchanges and celebrating their website launch. Looking to become a platform for charity donations, recycling rewards, crowd-sourcing and an eco-marketplace, EcoCoin is designed to be a PoS-based coin with a huge audience.     But even if your heart is set on PoW-based coins such as Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin, there are still ways to mine them without pushing national grids to the limit. HydroMiner, an Austrian-based Bitcoin mining operation, is making use of disused hydropower reserves in the country to power their servers. In addition, equipment is cooled by the cold mountain water circulating through pipes – a more efficient alternative than conventional air conditioning. Excitingly, they are currently planning an ICO to expand outside of Austria. We also have Pylon Network, an ingenious Spanish start-up which looks to reward users in its own cryptocurrency for solar power generation. The blockchain-enabled platform will enable the decentralized exchange of green energy for Pylon-coin. In addition, validating transactions will take place with ‘green miners’; servers that are run on excess renewable energy.  It’s easy to overlook the smaller coins and ICOs that are trying to push the industry in a different direction. But it’s all the more reason to think about investing now, while prices are low. It is normal to have doubts about economic viability, but it might be time to start thinking about the bigger picture; whether the giant PoW-based coins are actually sustainable in real terms. In any case, the issue of power consumption is in everyone’s hands, and if it isn’t paid immediate attention, Bitcoin will be the least of our worries.

0," It was once said that opportunity often comes disguised in the form of misfortune. Though it is one of the biggest cryptocurrency hotbeds on the planet, Nigeria’s bitcoin mania actually took off because of an infamous Ponzi scheme that roped in millions of Nigerians from late 2015 to the end of 2016. The Mavrodi Mondial Moneybox (MMM) scam, which first started in Russia and lasted as long as 30 years, promised investors a 30% return in as little as 30 days. When the Nigerian government started cracking down on accounts linked with the scheme, MMM operators were able to cut out the banks and started to require investors to use bitcoins. At the end of 2016, MMM suspended its payouts to investors, causing an estimated three million people in Nigeria to lose their money. But out of all that chaos, something fascinating happened: people realized that bitcoin was just as valuable as money — that bitcoin is the future. According to Lucky Uwakwe, co-founder of Blockchain Solutions Ltd., a cryptocurrency firm in Lagos: “It was MMM that made Nigerians understand how Bitcoin worked.” Today, Nigerians are trading about $4.7 million worth of bitcoin a week, up from about $300,000 per week a year ago. This number puts Nigeria at No. 23 globally, comparable to the volume of activity in Chinese yuan or Indian rupees. “The growth has been crazy,” said David Ajala, who runs NairaEx, one of about a dozen digital currency exchanges in Nigeria. “It took us two years to get 10,000 customers. Within the last year, we’ve added 90,000.” Because of Nigeria’s high fraud rates, online sellers do not process payments from Nigerian credit cards. This is why bitcoin has become an attractive option for consumers there. With bitcoin, there aren’t any costly chargebacks, and on the basis of transaction origin, it can’t be blocked. The majority of Nigerians keep it as an alternative asset class by using it as a store of value. In addition, as many emerging market currencies are struggling against the U.S. dollar, investors began using bitcoin as a hedge against the local currency depreciation. Bitcoin Scams are Prevalent in Nigeria MMM was just one of the many scams to flood a nation that’s notorious for criminal activities of this sort. With bitcoin quickly gaining popularity, the rise of scams involving the cryptocurrency was inevitable. Phony traders have inundated Nigeria’s cryptocurrency exchanges, messaging apps, and even the streets of every city in Nigeria, pledging fast and guaranteed returns to civilians and disappearing once they’ve taken their money. “A lot of people have had their fingers burned,” said Adeolu Fadele, founder of the Cryptographic Development Initiative of Nigeria, a group that aims to educate regulators and the public about digital currency. Most of these scams follow the same pattern: a potential victim would receive a message from a supposedly beleaguered Nigerian prince, and the target is asked to wire over money in exchange for bitcoin. In some cases, the scammer uses the ID of a real dealer and creates a trading profile on a local exchange that’s good enough to pass a cursory background check, a technique known as cloning. Others will make an offer not of bitcoin, but of “billion coin” or some other non-existent cryptocurrency. “Everybody I know has been scammed in one way or another,” says Bashir Aminu, a digital-security expert and bitcoin enthusiast in Lagos. Like in any other Ponzi scheme, the early investors in Nigeria’s bitcoin scams get paid with the money coming from subsequent investors. Since this kind of manoeuvre relies on new sign-ups, the scheme would collapse if no new investors are drawn in. To combat these scams involving something that’s not properly regulated, Nigeria has started developing informal groups of traders and follow an old-school approach to verify transactions. For instance, after seeing his friends lose thousands of dollars to scammers, bitcoin fanatic Aminu set up an informal exchange on the messaging app Telegram that would allow him and his friends to trade among themselves. Anyone else who seeks to join the group would need to go through a review procedure, where Aminu would look at their ID and banking documents and compare the papers in face-to-face meetings. Sometimes, he would even act as a trusted broker, holding a buyer’s money in escrow until the seller came through with the bitcoin transfer. According to Aminu, his group has grown to almost 800 members over the past year, and there are dozens of similar networks out there. Some networks arrange face-to-face meetings in homes, the backs of small shops, and other private places, where a buyer hands over cash and watches the seller make the bitcoin transfer over a smartphone. This kind of facilitation is pretty similar to those black market exchanges taking place all over the streets of Nigeria. As these informal networks grow and multiply, they would become increasingly populated by people who trade digital currency as a full-time occupation. Because of all of this informal trading, the size of Nigeria’s market is probably even bigger than what’s being reported. The emergence of informal networks in Nigeria has fortified the value of not just bitcoin but cryptocurrency in general to Nigerian investors, especially as the local currency continues to undergo wild swings. “For many, the potential profit is too good to pass up,” said Smart Oluwadola, a cryptocurrency peddler in Kano, a desert city in northern Nigeria. In August, a friend persuaded him to ditch a job hawking health supplements for a suspiciously pyramidal “business club” and buy a couple hundred dollars’ worth of bitcoin. His investment is now worth thousands of dollars.  “If you don’t take a risk, you can’t get anything,” said Oluwadola. “And if it’s going to be the future of currency, then you better start now.” As those living in any politically and economically unstable country could tell you, anything that leads to money entails its fair share of deceptions and unlawfulness that the government would rather turn a blind eye to, let alone fix. The cryptocurrency enthusiasts in Nigeria are doing everything possible to make sure this market is clean and absent of fraudulence — even it means following the most primitive and uninspiring method possible.

0," The crypto market is in a shambles the past couple of weeks as swathes of governmental regulations give investors cold feet. After last weekend failed to reinvigorate the market, many enthusiasts will be wondering where to look for some positive news. It may be on the way… Russia is a bit of a lone wolf as far as politics are concerned. As cryptocurrencies begin to tug at the strings of national and international affairs, the country will surely be thinking carefully about how to play its hand in regards to crypto regulation. Speculation abounded last year as Russian president Vladimir Putin met with Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin as part of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. Mr. Putin allegedly “supported the idea of establishing ties with possible Russian partners,” which, though vague, sounds positive.  >>Are Institutional Investors to Blame for the Latest Bitcoin Sell Off? In addition, Dmitry Marinichev, Mr. Putin’s internet advisor, is a huge supporter of Bitcoin. Indeed, news of his huge mining operation, located in an old Soviet car factory, garnered interest last year. Russia may be an ideal location for Bitcoin mining, given the long, cold winters (great for keeping the hardware cool) and cheap electricity. People are beginning to notice. As China continues to put pressure on crypto miners in the country, many of them are starting to see Russia as an appealing alternative. According to a November 2017 report by Bitcoin News, 40 companies from China and the EU have sent applications to the Russian Association of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (RACIB) to begin mining operations in the country.  All this being said, it is inevitable that Russia will place some regulations on cryptocurrency. Even the most financially liberal country is bound to be uncomfortable with totally unregulated flows of cash, particularly where large corporations are concerned. And Russia has certainly been very sceptical in the past, going so far as to consider jail time of up to 7 years for cryptocurrency users back in 2016. And as recently as October 2017, Russia’ central bank announced plans to restrict access to online cryptocurrency exchange websites. Despite all this, nothing concrete seems to have come to fruition yet. So what’s going on?  In recent weeks, Putin certainly seems to have come to a more level conclusion on the subject. According to Russian news agency TASS, Putin last week said that some kind of regulation will ‘definitely’ be required in future, though he acknowledged that Bitcoin et al “can be a settlement medium to a certain degree and in certain situations. This is done quickly and efficiently.” >>Bitcoin or Gold? Why Investors Should Consider Both in the Current Market Evidently, Russia is staying their hand on cryptocurrency regulation for the moment, and it is no coincidence that it is reportedly developing its own in the meantime. The so-called ‘cryptorouble’ being developed by the Kremlin will likely be investigated as a way to conduct global exchanges of cash while bypassing international sanctions. In addition, the Bank of Russia last year announced that it is now working with masterchain technology. Deputy Governor Olga Skorobogatova said: “We are planning to consider the use of the Masterchain prototype as a component of the new-generation financial infrastructure in the future.” This certainly suggests that the country is seeing the benefits of cryptocurrency and the innovations it comes with. In any case, the term ‘regulation’ is getting increasingly warped within cryptocurrency circles. While it is true that market prices take steep dives every time a country introduces new legislation to control the use of Bitcoin and its rivals, it does not necessarily mean an outright ban or threat of criminal charges. Russia’s Ministry of Finance announced that it was drafting a bill to regulate, or ‘legalize’, Bitcoin trading on certain platforms last December, with Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev stating that it “supports the legalization of trade on official exchanges”, despite it not being technically illegal at the moment…  If all of this sounds extremely contradictory, that’s because it is. The Kremlin has constantly altered its stance on cryptocurrency over the past couple of years, but presently it seems as though it’s beginning to reach some kind of conclusion. Russia’s headstrong approach in world affairs may see it taking a more lax attitude to cryptocurrencies as the West mulls over tighter control. The coming months will tell. Bitcoin currently has a market cap of $173,643,993,145 USD and is currently trading at $10,323.80 USD, down -9.68% from yesterday.  Featured Image: Twitter"
0," Bitcoin (BTC) continues to fluctuate. The rise and fall has been driven by regulatory concerns and analyst’s comments. A brief rally over the weekend sent bitcoin prices from below $10,000 to $13,000. However, this was short-lived; the bitcoin price collapsed again during Monday trade. Traders blamed regulatory concerns from South Korea, India, and the European Union for the latest plummet. Currently trading at just above $11,500, Bitcoin is down 11% from the previous close.  Several Indian banks have suspended cryptocurrency exchange accounts in order to control money laundering and the transfer of money from India to other destinations. The Indian finance minister, Arun Jaitley, has already denounced digital currencies and the government is now taking necessary actions to stop cryptocurrency trading. In a bid to control the massive growth in cryptocurrency prices, the European Union has signaled strong initiatives to end the bitcoin bubble. Valois Dombrovskis, vice president of the European Commission, has cited “clear risks for investors and consumers associated to price volatility”. The European Union has appointed Central bank Deputy Governor Jean-Pierre Landau to suggest ways to regulate digital currencies. In a separate report, Nordea Bank, the largest Northern European financial services group, has banned their employees from cryptocurrency trading. Although South Korea hasn’t yet announced a complete ban on cryptocurrency trading, they have implemented new taxes on cryptocurrencies. Several investors are pleased with the government’s decision of introducing taxes instead of banning the digital currencies. According to reports, the country has imposed a 22% corporate tax and a 2.2% local income tax on cryptocurrency exchanges. They have recently banned anonymous cryptocurrency accounts and prohibited foreign traders to trade virtual currencies in South Korean exchanges. The country has also frozen the opening of new virtual accounts. Despite mixed signals from the South Korean markets, investors are currently showing their concerns over India, which has completely suspended cryptocurrency trading accounts.     Featured Image: twitter"
0," DECO, the Portuguese Association for Consumer Protection, recently protested against Banco Santander Totta S.A., Portugal’s fourth largest bank, for blocking a client’s transfers on the grounds they were related to cryptocurrency. When João Nogueira, an associate of DECO, decided he wanted to invest in cryptocurrency, he went through all the steps required to connect his bank account to his exchange platform account, only to find out his bank was blocking him from making any cryptocurrency related transactions. After some back-and-forth where Nogueira insisted on clarification, it came to light that this was a matter of policy for the bank, despite not having any known legal basis to support its actions. The Portuguese central bank, Banco de Portugal, previously stated that they have issued no guidelines instructing banks to prevent money transfers to cryptocurrency exchange accounts. DECO has since reached out to six other Portuguese banks to ascertain whether they have any limitations set in place on this sort of transaction. Only one, Novo Banco, has so far answered, stating that they currently have no restrictions related to these operations. Earlier this month, Publico reported that the country will be charging no fees on crypto-related profits, as there is no framework in Portuguese law to consider them taxable. The authorities concluded that ""the trading of cryptocurrency is not taxable under Portuguese tax law, unless by its habitual nature it constitutes the professional or business activity of the taxpayer""."
1," There have been many speculations as to why Bitcoin (BTC) has seen such high volatility in the past five weeks. Many regulations have come to light from countries that hold the majority of Bitcoin holders, such as China and South Korea. Other speculations have been centered around the unknown affect the Bitcoin futures contracts have on the market and the lastest, the effect that institutional investors have had when they flooded the market. China’s government has been active in its cryptocurrency regulations, as it recently surfaced that it will shut down mining operations due to power shortages. Many speculations have surfaced that it isn’t, in fact, the energy problem that shut down these operations but it was China’s central bank, due to rampant fraud and “money laundering” occurring within the country. As the country now focuses on attempting to cut off access to online platforms used to trade digital currencies, many of its residents are bound to find ways around these new regulations. It is a compelling speculation and one that most seem to be on board with but some are not necessarily convinced.   Source: CoinMarketCap   Futures As you can see from the chart above, Bitcoin has had higher than normal consistent volatility in its price since the first launch of its Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) futures, on December 10th. It reached a record high of over $20,000 a coin, just before the major Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures began and took an immediate bearish turn. It remains unclear by many analysts how these Bitcoin futures have affected the market, but there is no denying that they have in some way. Noelle Acheson, an author from CoinDesk, made an interesting statement before the first Bitcoin futures launched. She said: “But… it’s also possible that the institutional investors that are negative on bitcoin’s prospects (and there’s no shortage of those) may use the futures markets to put money behind their conviction. It’s much easier to sell a futures contract with a lower-than-market price than it is to actually short bitcoin. These investors may well send signals to the actual bitcoin market that sends prices tumbling.” On January 9th, there were a total of 1,907 short position contracts on the CBOE exchange and when these contracts closed, BTC was down 36 percent. Since the price of Bitcoin has since rebounded and is selling above the $12,500 mark. The largest exchange, CME, will have its futures contracts expire this coming Friday. Many will continue to monitor Bitcoin’s price, as Friday closes in. Confirmation of the effect of these futures can only be shown with time.   Institutional Investors Buy-In The most intriguing argument I’ve read to date comes from Georgy Verbitsky, managing director of Russia & CIS at EToro, claiming institutional experienced investors who entered the bitcoin market drove down the price. Verbitsky explains that many understand that the reason for Bitcoin’s price skyrocketing and the influx of the cash flow within the past few months, stemmed from mass-market and pensioners investing. He told RT:  “Experienced investors knew that the bitcoin honeymoon couldn’t last forever. Those who catch the last train are usually punished by the market. Big-time miners and institutional investors understood that they needed to diversify, that they had to get some fiat money.” Verbitsky isn’t convinced that China and South Korean are to blame for the price drop. “It was about pure greed. Of course, after they lost a third to a half of their investments, they pushed the ‘sell’ button,” he said. He goes on to make a compelling point backing his argument, with China’s ban on ICOs back in September. Verbitsky claims that was a much larger blow to bitcoin but the market remained bullish and the hit went completely unnoticed.    What Next?
Verbitsky makes a compelling speculation, one I have not heard yet. While the futures effects continue to be monitored and remain unknown, most shouldn’t worry. Any sort of investment is a gamble but you can say investing in cryptocurrency with its high volatility, is extremely risky. Most invested in Bitcoin are in it for the long haul. If you’ve invested more than you can afford and are extremely concerned, I’d say sell because the volatility isn’t going anywhere. The price of Bitcoin will continue to fluctuate but many trusted financial analysts believe that 2018, will be the year Bitcoin continues to rise. Featured Image: Snip"
1," Now that we’ve seen how popular Bitcoin (BTC) has become over the past year, there is probably one question that almost every opportunistic investor is now asking: Is bitcoin worth the investment now?  The simple answer to that — of course — depends on one’s background, objectives, and wealth.  But an interesting proposition that’s been thrown around lately revolves around bitcoin becoming a topical investment that could even rival gold. Could bitcoin function in the same way as gold? Could it also be a store of value?  Coincidentally, both assets have roughly similar per-unit values at the moment. So now is a good time to ask these questions. To provide the answers, we must look at some of bitcoin’s key characteristics that make it attractive to investors. It is well documented that the bitcoin virtual currency has a limited supply — 21 million to be exact. Recently, reports came out informing the market that 80% of the world’s BTC has been mined, with approximately 4.2 million still remaining out there. In comparison, the supply of gold is said to increase by 1% to 2% annually.  Just by using the law of supply and demand, we can extrapolate that bitcoin’s value hinges largely on its demand. A perfectly inelastic supply — when all coins have been mined — signifies that any movement in bitcoin’s demand would directly affect its price without any part of the supply curve offsetting the demand-induced price movement. This is one plausible explanation (using market dynamics in economics) for bitcoin’s volatile; it is super sensitive to demand shifts. Because its supply is set at a certain amount, there is a good chance bitcoin will become increasingly valuable as demand continues to go up like it did for the past year. Remember, the global population is also growing, so the number of bitcoin consumers can only rise. Because it is a virtual currency, bitcoin is extremely convenient to buy and easy to carry around. This has both its pros and cons. On the bright side, every transaction involving bitcoin happens quickly, particularly those involving large sums of money, and its users can benefit from the anonymity of ownership, such that bitcoin can be used in all sorts of purchases. This makes bitcoin especially valuable in the black market. On the downside, because it’s virtual, bitcoin is more vulnerable to disruptions to its system (i.e. hacks), therefore potentially losing all its value. Moreover, bitcoin’s benefits can only be realized by a select group of people in the society — those who are tech-savvy. For the older generations, even the concept behind bitcoin eludes them, segregating them from the world of cryptocurrency. For the most part, bitcoin is considered a decentralized entity not subject to any government regulations. Again, this is both good and bad. While decentralization allows all members of the bitcoin community to engage in the mining and verification process, it does create problems that can only be mitigated by governing authorities. For example, without regulation, transactions in the black market, as well as money laundering using bitcoin, would be left uncontrolled. Remember the story in 2015 about the arrest of the owner of the Silk Road website and how bitcoin was involved in that ordeal? This is why some jurisdictions are pushing for cryptocurrency laws to tackle these issues. Indeed, bitcoin offers our society another choice of currency that’s both secure and easy to use with the potential to appreciate, but does that make it a good store of value compared to gold? For this, we must consider how their values would look years down the road.  Source: coindesk.com Looking at their historical prices, there’s a telling story: Bitcoin has a much higher variation over the past three years than gold, but overall it is trending upwards, while gold stayed relatively flat. This says a lot about the risks involved with these assets. Obviously, Bitcoin has a higher risk, though its value could keep going up especially as it is even rarer than gold. Also, the problem some have with bitcoin isn’t about its volatility, but how the volatility would hinder its path towards becoming real money. On the other hand, gold can be considered a relatively safer investment, especially as it has been around for thousands of years — nothing is going to hurt its status as the #1 precious metal. As an investor, you want to know your investment horizon when making a judgment. As seen over the past few months, bitcoin does fluctuate. Hence, those investing in the short term would have a higher chance of profiting from bitcoin. “For more than 5,000 years gold and silver have been tried-and-true money. They’ve lasted basically the duration of organized civilization,” said Dave Kranzler of Investment Research Dynamics. In the long run, both assets would likely go up but for different reasons. For bitcoin, its limited supply and the rising popularity of digital currency right now would certainly boost its value. As for gold, investors would always view it as a good hedge against inflation and the stock market, which was traditionally its most common use. Former PayPal president David Marcus once gave his own view on bitcoin: “I really like bitcoin. I own bitcoins. It’s a store of value, a distributed ledger. It’s a great place to put assets, especially in places like Argentina with 40% inflation, where $1 today is worth 60 cents in a year, and a government’s currency does not hold value. It’s also a good investment vehicle if you have an appetite for risk. But it won’t be a currency until volatility slows down.” The security breaches in the virtual world could be seen as the biggest fear factor for those buying bitcoin. No one can change the fact that bitcoin is a man-made entity, and anything created by humans has its own implicit uncertainties. Some also argue that bitcoin is “easy to get in but hard to get out”. In addition, interference by regulatory authorities has always caused fears in the cryptocurrency space. A government crackdown could hit bitcoin’s value depending on the nature and magnitude of change imposed. If one’s looking for a safe and reliable investment, gold would easily be one of the ideal candidates. The only major problem investors have is that it is not as transferable as fiat money, and certainly much more difficult when compared to bitcoin. Imagine you need to make a deal involving tens of kilograms of gold, someone would need to transfer that. Plus, there’s a possibility that it could get stolen on its way. So the speed in which gold can be used as a medium of exchange is not optimal in many cases. Whatever what your investment goals are, both bitcoin and gold are assets that have value in the future. In fact, as mentioned, gold can be a hedge against many things, and cryptocurrency may be one of those. This week, the market saw an influx of money pouring into gold purchases, with 30,000 kilograms sold on January 17, due to the cryptocurrency market (including bitcoin) being down for consecutive days.  Source: Bloomberg Therefore, one way to regard the “bitcoin vs. gold” argument is to see them as complements that diversify one’s portfolio.  On one hand, investing solely in bitcoin presents a “high-risk, high-reward” scenario, while putting all eggs in the gold basket is much safer but has a lower growth ceiling. This is tantamount to choosing between equity in a rising sector and bonds. In the end, the investment decision and allocation really depend on how aggressive an investor wants to be.

1," Most people have an opinion on bitcoin at this point in time. But it is hard to maintain a steady outlook on the digital currency due to the fact that the price is starting to fluctuate almost at a daily rate.  It’s for these reasons that people are calling bitcoin a speculative bubble. The latest to join in on the conversation is Robert Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale University, located in New Haven, Connecticut.  In the past, Shiller has been fairly vocal on where he stands when it comes to bitcoin. In fact, several months ago, the Nobel Laureate stated that the digital currency “has no value at all unless there is some common consensus that it has value.”  Further, he also stated in September of last year that bitcoin is the “best example of a bubble.”  That being said, it seems Shiller is neither for bitcoin now nor is he against it – he seems genuinely at a loss for words when it comes to the currency. Yesterday, Shiller said in an interview with CNBC that he “doesn’t know what to make of Bitcoin ultimately.”  Shiller might be confused, and he might still believe that the currency will one day implode, like many other well-known figures believe, but he did say that whether bitcoin collapses and is forgotten, he suspects that the cryptocurrency “could linger on for a good long time,” adding that the collapse could be here “in 100 years.”  Can you imagine another 100 years of this? Another 100 years of constantly waking up to see whether or not the price of bitcoin has dropped – like it has been as of late – or if it soared.  I don’t know about you, but I’m not sure I could take another 100 years of that. Featured Image: Facebook"
1," Fortunately, investors are pretty adapted with the big swings in the prices of cryptocurrencies. In fact, they believe in generating value from these movements. The movement of Cryptocurrencies remains soft in Friday trade after the dramatic last few sessions. Bitcoin pared previous losses, but the currency struggles to break the physiological mark of $12,000. Bitcoin was trading around $11,587.30, down 2.5% over the previous day. There were a lot of optimistic and downbeat news’ surrounding the market in Friday trade; traders are eagerly waiting for the final announcement from South Korea. Morgan Stanley’s (NYSE:MS) move of clearing the Bitcoin futures has raised trader’s sentiments, as this move will permit institutional investors to take part in the cryptocurrency trading. After the move, Morgan Stanley joined Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in legitimizing bitcoin futures. However, Morgan Stanley’s management hasn’t yet completely explained their plan whether they are going to take custodial responsibilities or market making. Analysts have a mixed opinion over the Morgan Stanley’s move. Although clearing bitcoin futures would be a low-risk action, but bitcoin’s volatile nature of making huge swings in a single trading session combined with its unregulated status could craft noteworthy systemic risks for the institutions involved. On the other hand, Bitcoin traders are waiting for the news from South Korea to make their future trading strategies. South Korea is the third largest cryptocurrency market. Thus, any new from Korean markets could lead big movements in prices as we have seen in the last two weeks. The renewed concerns amid the potential ban have wiped off almost $200 billion from the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrencies on Wednesday. Bitcoin has hit $9,402.29 on Wednesday, the lowest level since last November. “It’s impossible to ban Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading because the more you regulate, the more it will become popular,” declared Francesco Nazari Fusetti, CEO of Aidcoin and CharityStars. Regulating bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies appear to be a priority for several countries, due to the threat of money laundering, particularly in South Asian emerging markets. Indonesia, which is among the fastest growing south-east Asian country, has recently warned their citizens from cryptocurrency trading. Featured Image: twitter"
1," Following the famous all-time high of Bitcoin on December 15th, 2017, even the last few people who had been living under various rocks have finally heard about cryptocurrency. Many have decided they wanted in. It seems like the perfect way to get rich – almost zero work included, just buy at the dip and sell at the peak. Why didn't I think of that? I've known all about crypto for ages now! Because as they say, hindsight is 20/20, and while it may not be too late to start investing, you’re afraid that the bubble will still burst. Regardless of whether you're a seasoned veteran or a noob in crypto, you must be wondering what causes its market fluctuations. Short answer: if we knew for sure, we'd all be rich. I wouldn't be writing this article because I'd be busy hiding this sort of knowledge from the public, faking my own death and moving to the Azores. The long answer is in this article. The terms value and price may be used interchangeably here, both denoting the exchange rate of cryptocurrency in relation to another (generally fiat) currency. Governments
While the selling point of cryptocurrency is decentralization, it would be wrong to assume that governments have nothing to do with crypto price. Every time the (generally Orwellian) restrictions on the use of crypto are imposed in a country, prices change drastically within – the effect on prices in the world depends on which country we are talking about. While we, most likely, wouldn't feel the difference of a tiny country opting out of the game, the prices for locals would skyrocket. On the other hand, China banning Bitcoin has backfired on them, with the prices rising significantly within only a few days.  Security Breaches
Obvious though it is, security is a huge factor. When Bitcoin Gold was reported to be compromised in November, 2017, they were lucky to find that their prices had fallen by less than 7%. However, Bitcoin hadn't fared that well in 2014, after the discovery of the Heartbleed bug: prices fell 10% within the next month, and the world held its breath even when the breach was reported fixed. Paradoxically, though, crypto often bounces back or even rises instead of falling at all; with such expensive feedback, security is often improved in a surprisingly short time and leaks are patched – unless the currency has died for good. More is sometimes less
If you are among the select few lucky enough to have, for example, Bitcoin holdings above around USD 10 million,  it may prove challenging to exchange your BTC to a fiat currency without disrupting the market. This is caused by the fact that Bitcoin has not spread enough on the mass market yet – a fact that is likely to be amended soon enough. To a certain extent, this contributes to Bitcoin volatility, and is applicable to other cryptocurrencies as well. Although small, this factor shows the need for the mass market adoption of cryptocurrency through a new lens.  Public Perception
During and after the Mt. Gox, a crypto exchange, fiasco in 2014, prices plummeted in general, not to mention the crash on Mt. Gox itself – hardly unexpected, because who wants to be fooled like that? This goes both ways: Ripple increased in price 37,000% by the end of 2017, thanks to the interest of big-name banks and payment processing services – its target audience. Privacy and security also remained a concern in the eyes of the public, thanks to which in 2017, Monero saw a 2,531% value increase. For a decentralized currency that strives to be from the people to the people, the scrutiny of its audience is bound to be a major, possibly even the largest, factor in its market price. Panic Selling
We have all been there – you see prices increasing, everyone is talking about cryptocurrencies, and you think to yourself, “I really want to be part of this!” Sure, many of us stopped there (because we were scared of losing money), but luckily not all. Many more bought their preferred currency and waited for it to skyrocket. It happened to others, right? But we want quick profits! As soon as the price starts falling, we panic, thinking we won’t be able to break even at the very least, and sell it all. Now we’re comically wiping our brows and thinking we just barely made it out – until next week, the prices rise again...
Still, this sort of dumping can and will drop the prices even further very quickly. A number of cryptocurrencies has died this way, because they can’t make the laborious rise again. And while this is a known factor, not everyone agrees it’s as big as it seems to be. Market Manipulation
Luke Martin, blockchain startup investor and advisor, considers the forces behind the market fluctuations more sinister than most. „What if its [sic] not 'noobs' dumping alts, but its [sic] that speculators/MMs are moving their bids lower? Less liquidity from buyers. That would shift down the price of alts too... The market may be smarter than you think“, reads a recent tweet. And sure, if I refuse to pay the price you’re asking for, and the next person does the same, with enough encouragement, you will be forced to lower the price if you still want to sell.
Another noteworthy market manipulation tactic is ""pump and dump"", a decades-old scheme (made popular by the Wolf of Wall Street where a group of individuals (or, increasingly often, bots work together to buy a relatively unknown cryptocurrency simultaneously, causing the price to inflate through demand – and sell it off to eager investors, who are fooled by the rising price. The aforementioned individuals make off with the money, while the investors are left wondering where the other interested parties are. (Hint: there never were any).
___________ Conclusion With this breakneck pace of changes, improvements and reactions concerning cryptocurrency, its price will remain volatile at least over the next few years. Singling out the reasons for its fluctuations helps us understand them better, even though no combination of them is a fool-proof cheat-sheet for getting rich on crypto investments. In this regard, cryptocurrency is no different than any other investment that may rise or fall beyond belief in as short a time as 24 hours. The only safe way to hold on to your money is to remain behind the stage and watch without participating. But where’s the fun in that?"
1," A leading financial analyst believes that Bitcoin is not the cryptocurrency of the future, and will be overtaken by competitors such as Ripple and ethereum, comparing the current market leader to defunct social media platforms. Benjamin Quinlan, CEO and Managing Partner of his own consultancy, Quinlan & Associates, and formerly a leading strategist for Deutsche Bank, said that the recent fall in the price of Bitcoin is more than just a temporary blip, and indeed the Hong Kong-based banker believes that the cryptocurrency's valuation will be closer to USD 800 by 2020. ""It's a very emotional topic, where Bitcoin is and where it's going to go,"" explained Quinlan, talking to Bloomberg. The rapid fall in the valuation of Bitcoin in recent days has shaken many investors, and raised questions about its durability. ""The most recent example, with the price swings in Bitcoin, reinforce the fact that its core purpose as a medium of exchange or a currency is potentially threatened by the fact that its price volatility is just so extreme."" ""You add in additional things like transaction times are relatively slow, transaction charges, though it's technically meant to be free, are quite high, and it really thwarts the case that it's meant to be a potential currency."" Quinlan was more positive about the future for newer cryptocurrencies, with what he views as a greater inherent versatility than Bitcoin. ""Cryptocurrencies with potential applications, and utilities, such as Ethereum - smart contracts can be built on top of it, decentralized applications - Bitcoin in its current form can't do that. Other cryptocurrencies have anonymity functions and privacy that far surpasses the level of Bitcoin, and some have transaction processing times that far surpass Bitcoin."" Quinlan, who enjoys a successful parallel career in Kong Kong as a stand-up comedian, drew parallels with the early days of social media. ""There are various social media players - there are players that started out initially when the various social media platforms came about, but due to the fact that they were not technologically as advanced as competitors that came in, they really fell out of favor with investors."" Many will remember MySpace, and how it was superseded by Facebook, and that may be a change that we are about to see in the world of cryptocurrencies."
1," Most people have an opinion on Bitcoin at this point. Considering it took both this year and last year by storm, it would be hard not to form an opinion on the virtual currency, whether you are interested in it or not.  But it’s not just enough for the general public to speak out about their opinions on Bitcoin, because, let’s face it, we only really listen to credible and authoritative sources.  Therefore, today we are going to look at what some of the most well-known Bitcoin bulls and bears are saying about the cryptocurrency.  Before we begin, let’s do a little recap on where the digital currency is sitting as of right now and how it has been performing over the course of the past couple of weeks.  After dropping below the $10,000 mark on Tuesday, and then plunging as low as $9,199.59 in early trade yesterday, Bitcoin has now moved back to the $12,000 mark today, which indicates a growth of more than 20% when compared to the previous close.  Taking into consideration the past couple of weeks, today’s move is pretty significant, and I’m sure anyone who is pro-bitcoin is reasonably happy, but I can’t help but wonder if the price of bitcoin will ever move past $19,000 like it did on December 10 of last year.  As mentioned, we like to listen to credible sources when it comes to our financial decisions. The problem when it comes to bitcoin is that it seems that these sources are divided into two parties: those who are for bitcoin, and those who are against it.  For this article, we are going to be looking at what each party has been saying as of late.  First, we have Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat, who just opened up in an interview with CNBC on Thursday in which he stated that he forecasts that bitcoin will hit $25,000 by the end of this year.  This is pretty significant considering Lee had initially forecasted that the currency wouldn’t reach this market until the year 2020.  Another credible source that has spoken publicly about bitcoin is Peter Thiel, entrepreneur and investor, who stated back in November that anyone who is criticizing bitcoin is “underestimating it,” adding that bitcoin is a “reserve form of money,” comparing it to gold and stating that “it’s just store of value” and individuals don’t “need to use it to make payments.”  Last but not least, we have James Gorman, CEO of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), who stated last year that the digital currency is “something more than just a fad,” adding that the entire concept of “anonymous currency is very interesting.”  As mentioned, there are plenty of people hoping – and perhaps praying – for bitcoin to fail. Here are three public figures who have spoken out about bitcoin in a negative tone:  Saudi Arabian billionaire Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal stated in November, “I just don’t believe in this bitcoin thing.” A criticism in its simplest form.  The Prince went on to say that he believes the currency will “implode one day,” and that it doesn’t make sense to him that “this thing is not under control” and “not under the supervision” of a central bank.  Second, former chairman Ben Bernanke stated in November of last year that he doesn’t believe bitcoin will end up being a success because it is a clear “attempt to replace fiat currency and evade regulation and government intervention.” Last but not least, we have Joseph Stiglitz, who is a Nobel Prize-winning professor of economics, and someone I personally look up too.  Stiglitz announced last month that bitcoin should be “outlawed,” stating that it “doesn’t serve any socially useful function.”  Personally, I find it difficult to choose a side when it comes to bitcoin. Some days I think this digital currency is going to continue to climb, and other days I believe that it is just a speculative bubble. At least I’m not alone, however. It seems that most of the world, including our financial leaders, are experiencing the same confliction. What do you think? Yay or nay for bitcoin?  Featured Image: Twitter "
1," After the dramatic two days selloff, Bitcoin not only pared earlier losses, but the digital currency generated healthy gains in Thursday’s trade. Bitcoin moved back to the $12,000 mark in Thursday’s trade, signifying a growth of more than 20% compared to the previous close. Bitcoin hit as low as $9,199.59 in early trade on Wednesday. The price pared losses in the evening session and bounced back to the level of $11,188.84 at the end of the day.  Source: CoinMarketCap Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile in nature, evident from the latest sideways movement. Due to the volatile nature, governments all around the world are planning to make strict regulatory requirements for bitcoin and other digital currencies. After a long controversy, there is depressing news’ coming out of South Korea today. In a national policy committee meeting on Thursday, Choi Jong-ku, who is the head of South Korea’s Financial Services Commission said, “The government is considering both shutting down all local virtual currency exchanges or just the ones who have been violating the law.” Along with China, South Korea is leading other global players over crypto regulation, as several countries have already shown their strong concerns over the money laundering with the help of cryptocurrencies.        Answering to reporter’s question, Lee Ju-yeol said, “cryptocurrency is not a legal currency and is not being used as such as of now.”    China is also one of the countries that are making strict regulations for the virtual currency trading. The country is now looking to completely ban any type of centralized trading of digital currencies. South Korea has yet to make clear their stance on cryptocurrency trading. However, Bitcoin and the other digital currencies are moving higher in Thursday trade. There are some analysts who believe in the strength of cryptocurrencies and they see regulations as a favorable step for digital currencies in the long run. “These large drops, usually between the 25-40 percent range, generally find a bottom that is a consolidation of a previous-time high. When this bottom is found, the pattern continues with demand causing a new upward bounce,” said Nolan Bauerle, director of research at CoinDesk. Overall, the short-term future of the cryptocurrency is highly correlated to the final decision of South Korea.   Featured Image: twitter"
1," Remember Tom Lee? The managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, who once said last year that Bitcoin could reach as high as $25,000 in five years, reiterated his bullish stance on the cryptocurrency in a publication today, stating that even though it plunged by 34% in just two days, Bitcoin’s recent price action can be seen as “normal”. Explaining his rationale, Lee evidenced that the market had seen similar fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price for the past two years. He also pointed out that since mid-2016, there have been six rallies of more than 75% and six sell-offs exceeding 25%.  Source: Business Insider According to Lee: “What happens in years in equity markets is months in the crypto world.” Bitcoin’s price action since mid-2016 (as shown above) has shown that it is able to recover from the kind of drops we’ve seen for the past few days. This chart also resembles those of various tech stocks that have had tremendous growths over the past decade, but as Lee pointed out, any significant movement for Bitcoin happens in much shorter intervals compared to stocks. Based on this, Lee sees now as a great opportunity to “buy the dip” because he believes Bitcoin would eventually reverse back to its previous highs and test new resistance levels. “We think the best way to think about sell-offs is to look at it through the lens of retracements — how much of the prior rise is given back,” Lee wrote. “We view this $9,000 as the biggest buying opportunity in 2018 — and we would be buyers at levels around here.” Coincidentally, Lee’s “prophecy” has come to fruition to some extent, as Bitcoin rallied by approximately 20% as of Thursday morning. But like we’ve noticed with cryptocurrency, this could change at any moment. Beyond Bitcoin, Lee also added that he is extremely bullish on cryptocurrency in general, forecasting that this market could exceed $1.2 trillion. Featured Image: twitter"
1," On December 10, 2017, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), one of the leading derivatives exchanges in the US officially launched the trading of bitcoin futures contracts. A week later, on December 17, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange followed suit and also launched bitcoin futures on its exchange after the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approved the new financial product.  The announcement of bitcoin futures coming to two leading U.S. derivative exchanges sparked bitcoin’s incredible year-end rally that saw the price of bitcoin hit its 2017 high of USD 20,000 in mid-December, driven by the potential new investor funds that can now flow into bitcoin as both institutional investors and private investors are now able to bet on the price of bitcoin through a regulated investment vehicle.   What are Bitcoin Futures Contracts? Futures contracts, also referred to as futures, are standardized exchange-traded financial derivatives that provide an agreement between a buyer and a seller to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a predefined date. 
Each futures contract represents a specific amount of the underlying asset and futures can be either cash settled or come with physical delivery. In the case of bitcoin futures, the underlying asset is the digital currency bitcoin.  How Do You Trade Bitcoin Futures? To trade bitcoin futures on the CME or the CBOE as a private investor, you need an account with a brokerage that offers bitcoin futures trading. As for January of 2018, Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade, and Ally Financial offer this to their clients but more brokerages are expected to follow suit. Once you are registered with a broker that allows you to trade bitcoin futures you can buy them online in the same fashion that you would buy futures on commodities like gold, silver or oil. If you believe that the price of bitcoin will hit USD 20,000 by mid-February, you could purchase a CBOE Feb 17 XBT futures contract at USD 15,000. If by February 14, 2018, when the contract expires, the price is at USD 20,000, you will have made a profit of USD 5,000. This profit could be higher depending on the leverage that your broker can provide you with. Of course, you can also close out your trade ahead of the expiry date if you want to take profit earlier. However, if during the time of the contract the value drops, your broker will ask you to top up your margin account to ensure you can cover potential losses from the trade. If you fail to top up your maintenance margin account when you receive a margin call, your trade will be closed out for you by your broker.  Due to the added leverage that futures bring, they are considered a much riskier investment than stocks and bonds.  However, futures can also be used to hedge investment risk by entering into a short position. This was actually the original idea of commodity futures when they were introduced for farmers to hedge their market risk. For example, if a farmer knows he will raise 10,000 bushels of corn, he can short sell one futures contract for corn (assuming one contract covers 10,000 bushels of corn) at a specific price with the expiry set to the time when he plans on selling his corn. If the price of corn should drop before the farmer can sell his corn, this loss is offset by the gains on the short futures contract. In effect, commodity futures allow producers to lock in the price at which they want to sell their product.  CME vs CBOE Bitcoin Futures Futures are standardized exchange-traded financial products. However, futures contract do differ from exchange to exchange. That means you can only trade CME bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and CBOE bitcoin futures only on the CBOE.  While the two bitcoin futures contracts trade in the same way from a technical point of view, they have the following key differences:  CME bitcoin futures have the ticker ‘BTC’, have a contract unit of five bitcoins and 35% initial margin is needed to place a trade. CBOE bitcoin futures, on the other hand, have the ticker ‘XBT’, their contract unit is one bitcoin, and the margin requirement is 44%.  Both futures contracts are in US dollar and are cash settled, which means no bitcoin are exchanged at the end of the contract - only the cash difference. Also, both contracts have the three closest months listed as contract expiry dates.  If you are entirely new to futures trading, you can start out practicing using the CME’s bitcoin futures trading simulator before you place your first trade with your broker.  Bitcoin Futures - The Early Days When bitcoin futures started to trade on the CBOE on December 10, 2017, the price rallied as investors were confident that the opening up of bitcoin to institutional investors in this format would bring new money into the asset class. On the exchange itself, however, trading volumes of bitcoin futures remained comparatively low and was reportedly largely dominated by retail investors[/URL] as institutional market participants were concerned about the clearing of these new futures.  Less than USD 10 million worth of bitcoin futures were traded on the CBOE in the first hour of trading while at the same time, the popular bitcoin exchange Bitfinex traded around USD 170 million worth of bitcoin.  Bitcoin futures trading volumes have remained comparatively low at both the CME and the CBOE. At both exchanges, the January expiry contract is the most popular and is experiencing the most trading volume while February and March contracts are seeing very little trading action.  Judging by the current rate, it looks like it will take a few more months before bitcoin futures will take up a larger share of trading at the CME and CBOE. This is most likely the case as the majority of large investment houses are still assessing the risks of gaining exposure to a decentralized digital currency such as bitcoin."
1," The payment card company Visa would not be processing transactions that are cryptocurrency-based, told Visa CEO Alfred Kelly in an interview with CNBC. He said he didn’t see Bitcoin as a “payment system player”. ""My take is that Bitcoin is much more today a commodity that somebody could invest in; and honestly, somewhat of a speculative commodity,"" said Kelly. This goes hand-in-hand with the recent veto on cryptocurrency cards; earlier this month, Visa subsidiary Wavecrest withdrew its service seemingly overnight, leaving crypto card issuers struggling to find alternative solutions. And while Visa remains tight-lipped about the reasons for the veto, offering only that it was due to “continued non-compliance with our operating rules”, Wirex CEO Pavel Matveev told Bitcoin News that, “Wavecrest have been violating Visa rules for months…it’s 100% Wavecrest’s fault and they knew it was coming a couple of months ago.” Back in 2015, Fortune published an article about the stance of Visa and MasterCard towards Bitcoin, especially noting their seeming reluctance to throw in with cryptocurrency, instead expressing their interest in the underlying blockchain technology. The CEO’s current stance on Bitcoin only serves to support this existing speculation. In light of this latest unequivocal rejection of cryptocurrency, any companies intent on bridging the gap between crypto and fiat currency will have to look for other ways, knowing that no support will be forthcoming from either Visa or any of its subsidiaries."
0," Due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, they have a habit of making enormous swings during a single trading session. Cryptocurrencies fell dramatically during early trading on Wednesday, wiping off almost $2 billion from the total market capitalization. At the top of the selloff, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization plunged to $450 billion, sharply lower from an all-time high of above $800 billion. In early Wednesday trading, bitcoin dipped below $10,000 for the first time since early December.  However, bitcoin pared some of the early losses in the evening session, currently trading close to $11,000, lower only 2% from its previous day price. Its price hit the highest level of $20,000 mark on December 17. Discussing the longevity of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Dick Kovacevich, the chairman of Wells Fargo told CNBC: “I think it’s a pyramid scheme. It makes no sense. I’m just surprised it isn’t even lower. I never called it a fraud because there’s no fraudulent thing going on… the fundamentals make no sense.” During Wednesday trading, ethereum price also declined below $800 for the first time since the start of this year. Ethereum was among the best performing virtual currencies since the start of this year, amid its wide acceptance and unique features compared to bitcoin and ripple. The concerns related to the potential ban on cryptocurrency trading in South Korea have jolted its price in the last two sessions. After an early selloff in Wednesday trading, ethereum price recovered the majority of what it had lost. The digital currency is currently trading around $984, down only 1% from the previous close. Traders’ concerns related to strong regulatory requirements have burst cryptocurrency prices in the last two trading sessions. China has already taken strict actions against cryptocurrency trading, while South Korea is preparing a bill to impose tough regulatory requirements. The option of completely banning the cryptocurrency trading is still open, the South Korean minister said in an interview. Although prices recovered late in Wednesday trading, analysts have a bearish outlook for digital currencies.      Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Violka08"
0," Bitcoin extends the dramatic selloff in Wednesday trade, declined below $10,000 mark for the first time since November 28. The broader selloff was observed in cryptocurrency markets in the last two days, amid concerns over regulators.  Bitcoin lost more than half of its value since hitting the highest level of $20,000 on December 17.  Currently trading around $10,010, bitcoin lost more than 30% of value in the last two days alone.  Other major cryptocurrencies, including ripple (xrp), ethereum (eth), and bitcoin cash (bch) dived at a high double-digit rate in the last two days. Bitconnect was the worst performer, losing more than 95% of price since the start of this week, due to the announcement that it is closing its exchange indefinitely. Digital currency traders all over the world are shorting their positions, while others are sitting tight on the side to see the impact of regulatory uncertainty on prices. The price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies started falling last Wednesday after South Korean minister hinted the potential ban on cryptocurrency trading. Digital currencies have experienced a big blow this week on Tuesday when South Korean minister re-established their tough stance on cryptocurrency trading. In addition, South Korea has already banned creating anonymous cryptocurrency trading accounts. “South Korea will make a decision on a proposed ban on cryptocurrency exchanges after sufficient consultation and coordination of opinions,” the South Korean Minister said on Monday. Although global markets are accelerating on how to regulate cryptocurrencies, China has officially banned every kind cryptocurrency trading. They have also blocked trader’s access to offshore trading platforms that offer cryptocurrency trading. “There is a lot of panic in the market. People are selling to try and get the hell out of there,” said Charles Hayter, founder of Cryptocompare, which owns cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, France, Germany, and Indonesia are planning crackdowns on cryptocurrencies trading in the following days. Governments all over the world fear that crypto markets are turning out to be a haven for money launderers and terrorists. On the whole, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are tumbling on the fears of government’s crackdown along with a wave of selling. Analysts and fund managers are suggesting traders adopt the wait and the see strategy.   Featured Image: twitter"
0," Avid tech entrepreneur and NBA Dallas Maverick’s owner, Mark Cuban, just tweeted that next season the organization will accept both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) as a form of payment for ticket sales. This all started with a fan asking him on the social media platform when fans of the National Basketball Association would be able to purchase tickets with Bitcoin. However, the Dallas Mavericks won’t be the first NBA team to accept cryptocurrency as a means of payment for tickets. The Sacramento Kings started accepting Bitcoin back in 2014 for promotional products as well as ticket sales. In an interview with Coinbase, Cuban confirmed that they are currently looking into accepting other cryptocurrencies with their new crypto payment ability. Cuban said: “We will also look at accepting tokens from companies we have traditional business relationships with as a way to expand our customer base.” The ABC “Shark Tank” investor is a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space. Back in June of last year, he called Bitcoin a “bubble”, but within months was on the crypto train. Cuban has now invested in a digital currency hedge fund and an ICO (which raised $31 million) and, in August 2017, also launched the Ethereum-based cryptocurrency Mercury Protocol. In October, he was cited as calling cryptocurrencies and blockchain the “future”. In a video named “How To Get Rich” he gave a tip that you should invest 10% of your life savings into Bitcoin and Ethereum. As the entire cryptocurrency market seems to be going through a rough patch these last two weeks, the fact that big-time tech investors such as Mark Cuban and Zuckerberg see prospects of digital currency gives a glimmer of hope. With any market, corrections will occur as well as technical issues, but investors that have been in the game long don’t seem too concerned. Featured Image: dallasnews"
0," China, which once dominated the global Bitcoin markets, continues its efforts to stamp out crypto-trading within its borders.  Following up on a 2017 nationwide ban on cryptocurrency-to-fiat exchanges and initial coin offerings (ICOs) , a senior Chinese banking official is now supporting the prohibition of additional services related to and involved with crypto-trading, Reuters reported, citing a memo outlining a government meeting in early January.  Vice Governor Pan Gongsheng of China’s central bank, The People's Bank of China (PBOC), said the government would implement additional regulations to shut down branches of the cryptocurrency industry including settlement providers, market-makers, guarantors, peer-to-peer lending vehicles, alternative trading platforms and cryptocurrency wallets, according to the report.  Moreover, Pan suggested local governments heighten their monitoring of mining energy consumption and use electricity price, taxes, and land use and environmental regulations as tools to guide the mines “toward an orderly exit.” China is currently a world leader in cryptocurrency mining because of its low energy prices. In late 2017, Pan famously predicted the death of Bitcoin, saying, “There is only one thing left to do: Sit by the river bank and see Bitcoin’s body pass by one day.” Since the recent crackdown on the crypto-sphere, major Chinese exchanges such as OKEx and Huobi Pro have redirected their business development into over-the-counter (OTC) trading, which typically uses private dealers rather than centralized exchanges, as well as overseas crypto-to-crypto venues. Pan feels websites and apps that facilitate these practices and/or help people move money overseas should be sanctioned.  Meanwhile, some major Chinese mining groups are now moving to the U.S., Canada or Iceland. BTC.Top, the third-largest mining pool, is opening a new location in Canada, according to media reports."
1," Cryptocurrencies continue to take a beating in China and South Korea – two major markets – as preventative legislation is ramped up to combat what they see as tax evasion and excessive speculation. China has today announced the banning of centralised trading of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies amid an ongoing crackdown, targeting websites and apps that offer trading services. This follows earlier steps such as the banning of ICOs – a form of fundraising whereby new cryptocurrency startups sell their coins – and plans to implement power usage restrictions to mining operations. Since it is now illegal for Chinese residents to engage in any centralized cryptocurrency trading, the only option they have are private over-the-counter exchanges. Meanwhile in South Korea, cryptocurrency traders and investors may face fines if they do not attach their identity to currently anonymous virtual trading accounts, according to a Yonhap news report. This deals a low blow for enthusiasts, many of whom see anonymous finances as a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency ideology. Other preventative measures include: So why are these two countries so determined to tackle cryptocurrencies compared to the countries in the West, where residents and institutions have pretty much free reign to use and trade as much as they like? China is set on ensuring as much money stays within the country as possible. Digital currencies not only provide a channel for money to exit China, but one that is almost completely anonymous and very hard for an external observer to keep track of. Couple this financial control with harsh digital regulation (including, but not limited to, their extreme internet censorship), and it’s not entirely surprising. Ironically, China is not inherently anti-cryptocurrency, having developed coins of their own in the past. Similar to South Korea, they just want to control it.  South Korea’s tightening control is more startling. Crypto trading there is arguably more frenzied than anywhere else in the world. The extent of this is such that prices here often are higher than elsewhere. Though the measures are certainly less rigorous than in China, investors will be feeling the heat as the government mulls over even tighter restrictions.  So what does all this mean for crypto values worldwide? Certainly, knee-jerk reactions to the news caused a slump last week as Bitcoin fell 14% in response to South Korean regulations on January 11th. But the real effect may be more apparent in the long-term, as mining crackdowns begin to squeeze the supply of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. It’s worth considering the deflation effect that this may have.  Featured Image: twitter"
1," Bitcoin price reversed some of the earlier losses in Monday’s trading, currently trading above the 14,000 level thanks to the trading strategy of buying the digital currency after the dip that some people use. Bitcoin lost considerable value last week, amid uncertainties related to the Chinese and South Korean governments. However, Bitcoin price jumped more than 6% in Monday’s trading, repairing some of the losses it generated last week.  Source Image: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin was standing around $17,468.90 on January 6. However, by January 13, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was selling for $14,237.70, marking a significant loss in price value. Although uncertainty regarding the regulatory authorities continues to impact investor sentiments this week, the majority of cryptocurrencies are still trading in the green today. Bank Indonesia has warned investors about trading in cryptocurrencies. The bank has taken a strict attitude against cryptocurrencies, urging investors to avoid buying, trading, or selling digital currencies. Early this month, Bank Indonesia also imposed a ban on all financial technology companies that were using cryptocurrencies for their transactions. They haven’t entirely banned cryptocurrency trading yet, but they have issued a new warning about it. On the other hand, the South Korean authorities have been silent over the threat of a potential ban since last Thursday. Last week, the South Korean justice minister announced that the government is preparing a bill to ban anonymous cryptocurrency trading. South Korea will make a decision on the proposed ban of anonymous cryptocurrency exchanges after “sufficient consultation and coordination of opinions” has occurred, said the country’s government on Monday. The broader rally was observed in crypto markets after the latest statement from South Korea Bitcoin price has soared above $14,259 in Monday trading after an early selloff. Bitcoin’s market capitalization is now hovering around $239 billion. Last week, Bitcoin lost almost 18% of its market capitalization but seems to now be in an upswing.   Featured Image: twitter"
1," Bitcoin has gained significant price appreciation last year with few shortfalls, hitting the peak of $19,343 in mid-Dec. However, bitcoin price started tumbling since then and fell to around $12,000 level at the end of the last year. It is currently trading just below $14,000. The price of bitcoin declined more than $2,000 compared to a month ago level, up more than 1,600% over the same period last year.  Source: coinmarketcap.com Several factors added the big swings in bitcoin prices over the last two weeks. Initially, reports of strict regulations and higher taxes on bitcoin miners in China negatively impacted cryptocurrencies.  Moreover, concerns related to the potential ban on cryptocurrency trading from the South Korean government increased the volatility. Although the bitcoin history suggests big swings in a short-time, Warren Buffett expects a bad end for the cryptocurrencies. Investors and analysts seriously fear that the bitcoin bubble could burst anytime. Several major fund managers and renowned investors have been suggesting that investors avoid trading bitcoin, while the Securities Exchange & Commision has informed people to “exercise caution” and be wary of scammers. Buffett said the recent growth in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could have a bad end. On the other hand, John Rogers, the CEO at Ariel Investments, said the price of cryptocurrencies and bitcoin could decline sharply lower in the next five years.  Source: Wall Street Journal Bitcoin is a blockchain technology and it has only an online presence. Moreover, investors don’t have the authority to reverse transactions, making it an eye-catching option for cybercriminals. Several institutional investors are also taking short positions on bitcoin, signifying their bearish outlook. Overall, it appears that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are experiencing obstacles in wider adoption and their use in the real world. Goldman Sachs has also presented similar stance on bitcoin. Goldman Sachs says it is quite difficult for bitcoin to prosper as real money. The substantial volatility and swings in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies prices also suggest that it cannot work as money. Therefore, investors should remain cautious when trading bitcoin and other digital currencies.    Featured Image: twitter"
1," Ever wanted to buy oceanfront real estate in British Columbia? It will currently cost you around 200 bitcoin today but tomorrow, it might cost you 250. Camilla Stephan-Heck and her husband have decided to accept the highly volatile cryptocurrency in exchange for their beautiful Vancouver Island home. Calculated in dollars, the couple is seeking $2.7 million CAD for their 5 bedroom oceanfront mansion. The dentist and lawyer bought their dream property back in 2001. They listed the home back in November but hadn’t started advertising on cryptocurrency websites until this month.  Mrs. Stephan-Heck said: “We dabble in cryptocurrency ourselves, we’re fairly diversified in our investments, bitcoin was gaining notoriety and we started doing some research. We’ve done reasonably well on it. It’s enough to have fun with.” The couple would accept either a full or partial Bitcoin payment but the real estate agent they’ve decided to use, expects the couple to be paid in CAD. The property is paid in full and the couple are currently waiting for the right offer. There are a dozen other Canadian homes listed for sale on the Bitcoin Real Estate website, including a farm and luxury condos. There is one buyer on the site that is looking for a home in Calgary and is willing to spend $450,000.  However, this isn’t new in the United States as many homes have already been sold in exchange for Bitcoin from Florida to Washington State. Many car dealerships have even begun accepting Bitcoin for luxury vehicles. Newport Beach California’s Lamborghini dealership has accepted payments in Bitcoin since late August of 2017.  It was inevitable that cryptocurrency would be adopted into goods, as many investors found it to be the most frustrating aspect of the digital currency. As returns continued to grow as the cryptocurrency market skyrockets at the last half of 2017, individuals grew frustrated that they were unable to spend their wealth on goods.. VISA and Mastercard have teamed up with projects and there are now cryptocurrency debit cards, that are accepted wherever these major card companies are accepted. The company does the conversion of the transaction and it is no hassle to the retailer. As cryptocurrency continues to grow, we could see more and more goods being bought in digital currency.

1," That’s right, you can now buy KFC’s fried chicken with bitcoin in Canada. The fast-food chain is now accepting the cryptocurrency for a limited time for customers to buy a Bitcoin-themed chicken bucket called the “Bitcoin Bucket”. At the same time, KFC will also place a Facebook-based live tracker of the bucket’s price corresponding to the bitcoin-dollar exchange rate. To solve the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, the company has pegged the price of a Bitcoin Bucket at $20, which will be converted into fractions of a bitcoin when a purchase is made. In case you’re wondering how you can walk into a Canadian KFC location and purchase the Bitcoin Bucket, well, you can’t, at least physically. Instead, it is bought online using Bitpay as one of the payment options and the bucket will then be delivered to the customer’s address (though a $5 shipping fee will be charged). Currently, the Bitcoin Bucket is sold out (unfortunately). With this publicity stunt, KFC now joins a fast-growing list of companies to hop on the cryptocurrency bandwagon. The company’s social media team has been updating constantly on Twitter on the status of its mouthwatering Bitcoin Bucket. It has also suggested that other cryptocurrencies may be accepted as well in the future. Regardless of what these crypto-related marketing campaigns do for the profitability of companies, they open up a yet-to-be explored territory for both marketers and consumers that would cause a lot of excitement. We are now seeing bitcoin become mainstream. Featured Image: twitter"
0," Last year, Jamie Dimon, who is the current CEO of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), disclosed that he was not on board with the hype surrounding the cryptocurrency market, going as far as saying that he will fire any trader involved in trading digital currencies. However, all of that changed on Tuesday, January 9. On Tuesday, Jamie Dimon gave an interview with Fox Business in which he stated that even though he is still skeptical of Bitcoin, he regrets labeling it as a “fraud.”  For those who don’t know, Dimon has been CEO and President of JPMorgan since 2005.  Considering bitcoin was immensely popular throughout 2017, Dimon received a considerable amount of backlash after he made the “bitcoin is a fraud” comment back in September of 2017. Then, in October, just to spite those calling him out for his opinion, Dimon came forward and that he was not going to talk about the virtual currency anymore. That did not last long, however, as he was soon reported as saying that anyone who invests in bitcoin will eventually “pay the price.”  Now Dimon might come across as a little pessimistic when it comes to cryptocurrency, but he has been known for giving praise to blockchain technology, which is essentially the mastermind of bitcoin.  It seems Jamie Dimon is not the only person who feels this way; it seems anyone who is wary of bitcoin has no problem admitting that blockchain, on the other hand, is not a fraud. He told Fox Business on Tuesday that blockchain technology “is real.”  As we move further into 2018, it will be interesting to see if Dimon makes any more changes regarding his opinion on the cryptocurrency market.  What do you think? Do you think it’s true that bitcoin might not be a fraud, but one should still try to stay away from getting heavily involved in the sector? Let me know!  Featured Image: twitter"
0," Bitcoin has extended the selloff in Tuesday’s trade after a sharp decline in the earlier session, amid concerns over the future of digital currencies after the new regulations from the Chinese government. The price of bitcoin has dropped sharply in the early trading session on Tuesday. However, its price gains some momentum in the afternoon session and currently trading just below the $15,000 mark. Although bitcoin declined in the last two trading session, it is still showing strong improvement compared to the level it has seen two weeks ago. Its price declined 4% in the last thirty days, but the price is up 1,545% in the last twelve months. Bitcoin has touched the highest level of $19,850 in mid-December but declined sharply in the next few days to the level of $12,000. Bitcoin has made big swings in the last couple of weeks on the back of mixed reports. The latest volatility in bitcoin prices was the result of strict policies from the Chinese government. According to Reuters and Bloomberg, China seeks to reduce electricity supply to bitcoin miners. China, which is a home for several miners, decided to impose hard regulations on bitcoin and other miners through, taxation, electricity pricing environmental regulations and property laws. Moreover, comments from JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts have also impacted bitcoin prices and traders sentiments. JPMorgan Chase CEO, Jamie Dimon, said bitcoin was a ‘fraud’. Furthermore, the decline in bitcoin’s price over the last two sessions was also supported by CoinMarketCap, which lists cryptocurrencies prices and valuations. The CoinMarketCap has removed data from South Korean exchanges, as the site has witnessed discrepancies from global prices at exchanges in South Korea. Several analysts and market pundits are showing their concerns over the sudden rise in bitcoin value and they expect this bubble to burst anytime in the days to come. On the other hand, the SEC has suggested investors to “exercise caution” and be wary of scammers.  Nevertheless, some investors have a positive view of the future fundamentals of bitcoin. For instance, Eric Lonergan, a macro fund manager at M&G, said big banks will jump on the bitcoin bandwagon and adopt digital currencies like Ripple and ethereum. Featured Image: twitter"
1," Bitcoin (BTC) has had a rocky 30 days since its futures contracts launched on Wall Street. Despite that, there’s no denying that it was a phenomenal year for the world’s first digital currency.  Source: coinmarketcap.com At press-time, Bitcoin is trading at $17,372.10 a coin, up 13.06% for the day. The digital currency has stayed under the $17,000 mark, for the past two weeks. For the month, BTC is up 44.5% and is up a staggering 1599.59, for the year.  Many analysts predicted that Bitcoin’s surge would come to a halt once its futures rolled out and they were correct. At one point in December just before the first launch of the contracts, Bitcoin was growing over $1,000 a day. Just recently, Bitcoin seems to have gained some steam. Back on Tuesday, the coin was selling at lows of $13,293.80 but seems to have grown $4,000 in just a matter of days, mimicking old habits.  Since Bitcoin’s decline, many altcoins have gained some serious momentum. Ripple (XRP) is now the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap and has just passed the $3.00 mark. Just today, Ethereum (ETH) hit all-time highs selling above $1,000 and is sitting comfortably at the #3 spot.  Tron (TRX) is the latest the make the biggest splash, when it comes to the altcoins, as it is up nearly 9000% in just 30 days. A game was just announced similar to Ethereum’s cryptokitties, called TRON dogs and there has been tremendous buzz since. The Chinese year of the dog is slowly approaching and it seems Chinese investors can’t wait to get there hands on these dogs. Earlier in 2017, if Bitcoin suffered mostly all of the other altcoins suffered. This does not seem to be the case anymore and there’s been much talk around the cryptocurrency space, as to which altcoin will reign supreme in 2018 and take Bitcoin’s place. What do you think?

1," Despite the many successes they have experienced this past year, cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin especially, have seen their fair share of controversy. We’ve seen hacks that have lost people a lot of money, stock prices becoming inflated thanks to blockchain investments, fake digital currencies, and who could forget the huge plunge the original cryptocurrency took from near-$20,000 to below $13,000 at the end of December? Now, we bring you the next level – Egypt has banned Bitcoin. Bans on cryptocurrencies have happened before; a country deciding it’s against Bitcoin is nothing new. However, in this particular case, the Egyptian Grand Mufti who ordered the ban hasn’t just declared Bitcoin illegal for the country, he’s declared it as a direct transgression against Islam. According to the Egyptian Grand Mufti, as well as several other prominent Islamic leaders and their backers, Bitcoin is against the entire religion. This makes perfect sense once you listen to the reasoning behind this claim. Participating in the trading of cryptocurrencies is akin to gambling, which is strictly forbidden in Islam as it can directly cause the financial ruin of investors. Bitcoin, of all the cryptocurrencies, portrays this the best. It is extremely volatile, as is evidenced by the slide it experienced in December, and so it is certainly capable of causing a lot of financial ruin. People are saying that the preeminent coin is beginning to recover now (it is currently selling for $15,174.90, according to CoinMarketCap), but who is to say there won’t be another huge slide like the one witnessed at the end of 2017? A thing can only grow for so long. Egypt has declared Bitcoin a dangerous prospect and, frankly, this may not be the worst stance to get behind. Cryptocurrencies can be fun to play around with, much like gambling, but also like gambling, I think I’d prefer to watch from the sidelines. Featured Image: twitter"
1," According to all data, 2017 is the year of the cryptocurrency - which is when it saw the largest spike in search traffic, transactions, public interest and of course prices. Those saying that Bitcoin, but also other cryptocurrencies, are a bubble come a dime a dozen.  Although crypto aficionados will vehemently deny the possibility of a bubble, it remains hard to know. There is, after all, only one way for cryptocurrencies to not pop: mass adoption. Luckily for the industry, most of our popular coins, led by Bitcoin and Ethereum, are already on the right path. Bitcoinsaltcoins.com points out the proof to this through four distinct trends. Steady traffic growth A total market cap of USD 150 billion in the case of Bitcoin and USD 69 billion for Ethereum vouch for this trend. Google Trends data also proves people’s interest in the young industry, given that everybody wants to learn more about it through googling. There was a significant correlation between search traffic and prices, although correlation does not always equal causation. In short, after a while, the network size of Bitcoin may become too big to fail - there will always be somebody interested in it, at least in terms of a speculative asset. This may not be the endgame for most early investors who would like to see Bitcoin grow into an accepted currency, but at least it is a guarantee against failure. Consumer-friendly applications Following the ever-increasing wave of initial coin offerings (ICOs), new features, mostly on the blockchain, are also trying to find a place in the industry. What’s possibly the best feature of ICOs and the projects they are representing is the fact that they are getting increasingly more user-friendly. Growth from developer-oriented apps and tokens towards people without as much understanding of even computer sciences, let alone anything else, may be the shift needed for mass adoption. Many of these projects are looking for ways to create an often decentralized environment (unless specified differently) for what they want to do. Some projects are looking for ways to bring more gender equality into this glaringly male-dominated field; others are simply creating a place for game developers to make games, eliminating the bias of centralized market places and fundraising platforms. Increased public awareness How many people do you know that haven’t heard the term Bitcoin? It has swiftly grown from a niche field to a household name. Although increased public awareness is not an exact, measurable metric, it can be intuitively observed - not very many people are going to look at you bewildered when you mention crypto. Educating people is also an important aspect of awareness, as this is a new frontier that everyone is naturally scared of. However, the rapid development of technology within the past few decades has already taught people to be more accepting of new things - for example, the internet wasn’t so bad after all, right? Educating people about blockchain and cryptocurrency is the only surefire way to have them look for possibilities rather than weaknesses in the industry. Industry-wide growth There is a term in the world of forecasting called “cone of uncertainty,” used by experts to determine a project’s chances of reaching a milestone based on previously accomplished milestones. Most of Bitcoin’s future milestones are based on continued growth, while Ether and other tokens will likely follow Bitcoin’s expansion pattern. This has already been proven to be the case: whenever Bitcoin rose, so did the others - and the same was true for the prices falling. These metrics are far from being conclusive, but are doing a good enough job of it. As the industry grows, it continues to establish the model for cryptocurrencies and indicates a greater likelihood of reaching the final milestone of mass adoption. Although the general consensus of cryptocurrencies being volatile still stands (as does the old, “don’t invest more than you can afford to lose”), the industry is moving into mass adoption territory quickly and with few hiccups - other than the general confusion regarding potential regulation. But as Jim Rohn, an American entrepreneur, author and motivational speaker, would put it, “If you are not willing to risk the usual, you will have to settle for the ordinary.”"
1," Just how many Bitcoin billionaires are there in the world? Nobody knows for sure, but recent speculations have the number pinpointed to somewhere between 35 and 200 – a far cry from the two everyone thought back in December. The Winklevoss twins were the first publicly verified Bitcoin billionaires, holding around 91,666 Bitcoin, which at the time would have equaled about $1.063 billion. The keyword there, however, is “public”. We knew about the twins; they weren’t keeping their wealth a secret. But not everyone wishes to be a public figure, for any number of reasons (which will be discussed below), so the likelihood that the twins were the only Bitcoin billionaires was pretty slim. Why is it so difficult to figure out how many people hold a certain amount of Bitcoin? Well, for one, the very nature of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is to provide an anonymous source of currency. There are some who are exceptions to the rule, such as the Winklevoss twins, but there are many more people who fall into the rule, keeping their identities secret. Bitcoin makes it very easy to remain anonymous as well. Those that are smart will keep their funds in a digital wallet. Those that are really smart (and those that hold large fortunes of Bitcoin) will keep their funds in multiple wallets. We may be able to see how much is in this or that wallet, but we have no way of knowing if this or that wallet is owned by the same person or group – especially if those wallets don’t link to one another in a traditional way. Why would someone want to keep their Bitcoin ownership a secret? For one thing, hackers. If a hacker knew exactly who they needed to target, I would imagine it would be easier to target them. Those that were publicly out as Bitcoin billionaires would also be among the few cryptocurrency investors who would be hit hard with taxes and regulations that government agencies aren’t able to throw at Bitcoin due to the complexity and anonymity of the cryptocurrency world. That alone is certainly enough for someone to want to keep their billionaire status secret. In all likelihood, most of the Bitcoin billionaires, however many there are, are probably made up groups of people. exchanges or hedge funds. There are probably fewer individual billionaires as the rose-tinted glasses would like to have us believe. But any way you slice it, the Winklevoss twins are definitely not the only ones out there.

1," There’s no denying that 2017 was a great year for Bitcoin. It started the year going for under $1,000. It started making some waves in the summer when it hovered in the $4,000 range. Then, in the early part of December, it almost hit $20,000, a phenomenal record that blew practically everyone away. Bitcoin made a lot of strides in 2017. Beyond just its amazing growth, the cryptocurrency hit a lot of milestones that would make any cyber mamma proud. Its growth also came with a growing acceptance into the mainstream – if you hadn’t heard of Bitcoin before 2017, you probably heard about it in 2017 – and Bitcoin also began to get integrated into everyday business, with payment platforms, companies, and even some financial giants taking up the cryptocurrency. It opened the door not just for itself but also for other digital currencies, some, that are seeing immense growths now, like Ripple. Blockchain, although somewhat more relatable to the cryptocurrency Ethereum, also grew in relation to Bitcoin. In the beginning of December, the preeminent coin saw not just one, but two launches for future trading contracts on the largest futures exchanges in the world, CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (NASDAQ:CBOE), which opened up the trading of cryptocurrency to a broader scope of investors on Wall Street. So where is it headed to now? The latter half of December actually saw a slight burst in the bubble that had investors everywhere panicking. The cryptocurrency dropped from its whopping near-$20,000 point to below $13,000 in a matter of only a few days, and it has yet to show very many signs of recovery. Currently, it is trading at $14,021, according to coinmarketcap.com (see chart below).  Source – coinmarketcap.com Bitcoin has started the new year with a decline, something which hasn’t happened since 2015 – a tough blow for some after all the highs in 2017. The top cryptocurrency is also losing its dominance of the market. According to coinmarketcap.com, Bitcoin’s dominance is now below the 40% mark, at 35.8%. What does this mean for Bitcoin? Is it the end of the cryptocurrency? In all likelihood, no. Many analysts, including the one who predicted 2017 climb, believe that Bitcoin is going to bounce back. It may not continue to grow at the immense rate of 2017, but it also seems doubtful that 2018 is going to bring a complete downfall of Bitcoin either. The coin still holds the largest market cap of all the digital currencies, with more than a $100 billion gain over the second highest cryptocurrency market cap, Ripple. It may be a rollercoaster of a ride, but Bitcoin is still going to be making headlines this year. Featured Image: twitter"
0," As we approach the end of the year, now is the time to reflect on all that happened in 2017 – and there was a lot. But, if you had to take a wild guess, what topic would you think was the most searched for on Google? President Donald Trump? North Korea and its nuclear program? Facebook and fake news? Or, would you guess that people spent a good amount of the year searching for news about digital currency Bitcoin? If you guessed the latter, you’re right. Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) just recently posted a series of data which details what the top searches in 2017 were. Bitcoin took second place in the “Global News” sector.  Since Bitcoin took the market by storm this year, it isn’t entirely surprising to hear that the currency made it on a list that looks at the top searches in 2017, but what is surprising is that news on the cryptocurrency surpassed news that covered events such as the 2017 Solar Eclipse as well as the horrendous Las Vegas massacre that took place across from the Mandalay Bay.  It’s almost comical that Bitcoin ranked number two, and was sought after on Google for the entire year, but then days leading up to 2018, the digital currency found itself in a slump.  What do I mean by a slump? Well, let’s just look at Bitcoin’s track record for the month of December. On December 10, the virtual currency hit an all-time high, moving past $19,800, but then found itself declining 12 days later to hit $10,400 on the popular U.S. Coinbase exchange. Since then, Bitcoin has struggled to stay above $11,000 but found itself sitting around $15,750 on December 27, and then back down to $14,000 on December 28.  Further, Google disclosed that “How to buy bitcoin” came in at third on its “How to…” search list.  It will be interesting to see if Bitcoin can keep its head above the water next year and if it will maintain its spot on Google’s top searches for 2018.  Featured Image: twitter"
0," On December 26, just one day after Christmas, a leading analyst for the Bitcoin exchange Exmo, was kidnapped as he was leaving his office, located in Kiev’s Obolon district, which is an urban district in Ukraine.  It has now been reported that Pavel Lerner, 40, was returned by his abductors on Friday, but is suffering from stress, and will not provide any comment on what happened in the forthcoming days. The exchange was founded back in 2013 and has since grown to become a respected exchange in the cryptocurrency sector, obtaining a presence with a number of developers from Russia, Thailand, and Spain, and financial advisers from the United Kingdom.   The news shocked the cryptocurrency community, both local and international, as Lerner is a well-known Russian blockchain expert, and as many know now, blockchain technology is what supports the virtual currency Bitcoin.  Exmo announced Friday that Lerner is safe and was returned with “no physical harm inflicted on him.”  Apparently what happened was that Lerner was leaving his office on Boxing Day when a group of “unknown masked people” approached him and threw him into a black car.  It’s unclear as to where Lerner was kept, or the reasons behind his kidnapping, but Exmo did confirm that Lerner was “thrown out on a motorway” by his kidnappers on Friday.  With more than 94,955 active users trading currencies on the Exmo exchange, it’s unnerving that such a thing could happen to this company. According to a spokeswoman for the company, authorities are looking into the matter.  Also this week, Exmo disclosed that it had suffered a cyber attack on Thursday. We do not know if the two cases are connected.  Featured Image: twitter"
0," Another day, another Bitcoin price drop. It never used to be like that, in fact, for a while, it was the opposite; but over the past couple weeks, it has become more and more obvious that the digital currency – and a number of other cryptocurrencies – is in a slump.  Here’s what’s been going on as of late:  On December 10, Bitcoin reached an all-time high, moving past the $19,800 mark. However, 12 short days later, the digital currency dropped to $10,400 on the Coinbase exchange, which, for those who don’t know, is an extremely popular U.S. cryptocurrency exchange.  It doesn’t stop there, however. For the days following the drop from the all-time high, Bitcoin has struggled to stay above the $11,000 mark but managed to climb yesterday so it could sit at around $15,750. That was until today, when Bitcoin continued its decline, dropping below the $14,000 mark.  So, what happened? Is it just because people are losing faith in the world of cryptocurrency? Maybe. I definitely have; in fact, I predict that Bitcoin will drop to $9,000 by February of 2018 – but this isn’t about what I think.  Thursday’s drop in price came after South Korea announced to the public that it is thinking about shutting down exchanges. To no surprise, most cryptocurrencies dropped on the news, with Bitcoin down as much as 10%.  Commenting on the drop, Robert Watson, who is the head of asset allocation at Mercer, said that he does believe Bitcoin to be just a speculative bubble and that it is inevitable that the digital currency will “more or less” collapse in the near-future. That being said, if you are still interested in cryptocurrencies, but you are pivoting away from Bitcoin, Ethereum (which is down more than 7%), and Litecoin (down more than 10%), you might want to think about trading your cards in for Ripple, which has been increasing for the past two days straight, trading over 26% yesterday and 3.86% Thursday.   Featured image: Twitter"
0," Virtual currency Bitcoin and President Trump have made most of the headlines in 2017, both of which have either sparked outrage or extremely strong support.  While some people are die-hard Bitcoin fans, others believe it is just a speculative bubble. For a while, it seemed that the digital currency wasn’t going to slow down at all, hitting an all-time high on December 10, but all of that changed very quickly when the virtual currency plunged on December 22 and has not gone past its all-time high since.  On Wednesday trade, Bitcoin was sitting at around $15,000 but has been struggling to stay above the $11,000 mark for the past couple days. This might be why William Galvin, who is the secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, announced today that Bitcoin is “entirely speculation,” and that it does not pass the “smell test.”  To some investors surprise – not mine though – Galvin announced that there is no product when it comes to the preeminent cryptocurrency, and it is all just speculation. He added that Bitcoin is so volatile because no is able to explain it or control it.  This isn’t entirely shocking to hear that Galvin feels this way considering he said two weeks ago that Bitcoin is a “worthless product,” providing a number of reasons to back up his statement.  It’s not just Galvin who feels this way, however. A number of people have come forward calling the virtual currency the new Ponzi scheme, with others saying it is going to drop to $8,000 next year. On December 11, Jay Clayton, Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange, posted a statement which described the dangers of investing in virtual currencies.  What do you think? Are you going to continue to invest in cryptocurrencies next year? Featured Image: twitter"
0," Taking into consideration the past couple weeks Bitcoin has endured, I’m not entirely surprised to hear that DataTrek Research co-founder Nick Colas forecasted on Wednesday that the digital currency will experience more price fluctuations in 2018 as well as four more market crashes.  Looking back on 2017, one cannot deny that the preeminent crypto coin took the market by storm. It seems to be that people either love it or they hate it; either people are going to put all of their eggs in the cryptocurrency basket or they are going to argue that it is just a speculative bubble. Based on the latest couple of weeks, I’m going to say that it is the latter.  After hitting an all-time high on December 10, soaring well above the $19,800 mark, the digital currency plunged on December 22 to a low of $10,400 on the Coinbase exchange, which is one of the most popular digital currency exchanges in the United States. On Wednesday, in morning trade, the price was sitting at around $15,750. Bitcoin is definitely in the midst of a slump, and it is starting to affect a number of organizations in the sector. In fact, just last week, after Bitcoin fell more than 5% in 24 hours, both Riot Blockchain Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) and Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCMKTS:GBTC) shares plunged almost 20%.  Mentioned briefly, on Wednesday, December 27, Nick Colas, who has been covering Bitcoin for the past four years, stated that Bitcoin is in for a “wild ride” next year. Even though the digital currency has increased almost 1,600% over the course of the past year, Colas wholeheartedly believes the coin is going to experience a tremendous amount of volatility in the forthcoming year.  Elaborating further, Colas stated that in 2018 Bitcoin could be trading within a range of $6,500 to $22,000.  Meanwhile, others have come forward and said that the cryptocurrency is just another Ponzi scheme, or another Dutch Tulip Bulb Market Bubble, while others believe Bitcoin could drop to $8,000 next year. Personally, I am forecasting that Bitcoin will drop to $9,000 by February of 2018.  What do you think? What are your predictions for Bitcoin next year? Featured Image: Depositphotos/© VadimVasenin"
0," Bitcoin, along with many of the other cryptocurrencies, has witnessed a dramatic price drop Friday, with Bitcoin losing almost 50% at its lowest compared to the $20,000 high it had achieved at the beginning of the week. Currently, the coin’s price has readjusted to $14,860 since falling, so already it looks to be in a recovery phase – and this is what many analysts are focusing on and using to keep the calm among the crypto investors. Many analysts are encouraging investors, especially new-to-the-block investors, not to panic about the price drops and to hold onto their coins. A correction was bound to happen eventually; a thing can only go up so much before it needs to come back down a little, and these types of things happen all the time with market trading. This isn’t the first time the digital currency has dropped in market share (and it will no doubt be the last); at the end of the summer, the cryptocurrency saw a dip after increasing for many weeks. Many analysts, including Alan Silbert, who has long been versed in the crypto-sphere, believe that this is the correction that was expected, but that cryptocurrencies will recover. What could be causing the drop right now? It could have something to do with the launching of the Bitcoin futures contracts. Through those contracts, investors are able to short on Bitcoin, meaning they can bet against it essentially. On December 10, Cboe (NASDAQ:CBOE) launched its futures contracts, which was followed a week later on December 17 by CME (NASDAQ:CME) in its launching of its Bitcoin futures contracts. Both did exceptionally well, with the Cboe launch pushing Bitcoin 19% higher. Initially, the future contracts would cause Bitcoin price to increase, as an extremely high amount of people are trading or betting on it, but as that slowly begins to wear off, and people sit back to wait and see where their bets will land, Bitcoin’s price is going to be affected. That looks like what we’re seeing a bit of now. It could also be the time of year. ‘Tis the season, but maybe not for Bitcoin. Featured Image: twitter"
0," Now that Bitcoin’s price has dropped to $15,463.20 when it was previously above $19,000 just 5 days ago, there have been a lot of speculations on why it’s currently dropping after gaining so much this past year and on where Bitcoin will go next. One of the main reasons behind the current Bitcoin drop, experts say, is because of the high transaction fees that Bitcoin is subject to at the moment. According to Erik Voorhees, the CEO of ShapeShift (private) – a company that offers global trading on a variety of digital assets through web and mobile platforms – the average Bitcoin transaction fee has increased to $40 per transaction over the past 12 months. That’s a rate that is even higher than most bank wires. Higher Bitcoin transactions fees could be a reason behind Bitcoin’s current price slump (the high fees could be deterring some people from wanting to trade as much in Bitcoin), but another reason that has been given to the slump, which has declined another 5% as of Thursday, is linked to Ethereum, along with other altcoin cryptocurrencies in general. Bitcoin used to have the dominant share of the cryptocurrency world, but that share has dropped before, and this week it dropped again. Bitcoin now holds slightly less than 44% of the crypto market, which is the lowest that it has seen since August. The main factor behind this is that Ethereum has upped its share in a gaining price rally, as have several other altcoins such as Ripple. Ethereum increased its market share to 13%, effectively helping to lower Bitcoin’s share, thus reducing Bitcoin’s worth. Despite the slump, many analysts are saying not to panic. A drop like this is normal after the extreme growth Bitcoin saw this year (the last month alone saw Bitcoin soar from $8,000 to $19,000). Also, the slump certainly hasn’t been dissuading investors from speculating on Bitcoin’s future price. Just recently, an unknown trader, or group of traders, put up a million-dollar bet declaring that Bitcoin will reach $50,000 by the end of 2018. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© maxxyustas"
0," The New York Stock Exchange has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow the NYSE to list two Bitcoin ETFs. ETFs are exchange-traded funds. The NYSE wants to list two ETFs that will use futures contracts to track the price of Bitcoin. If approved, traders would be able to bet on how the Bitcoin future contracts will perform. Adding an ETF to the trading of Bitcoin future contracts would add further legitimacy to them. The ETFs, which the NYSE filed with the SEC on Tuesday, December 19, is a follow up from when ProShares, the leading provider of ETFs, filed for them in September. At the time when ProShares filed them, the ETFs, ProShares Bitcoin ETF and ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF, were refused review by the SEC. The SEC claimed that the reason for this was because the underlying assets, in other words, the Bitcoin futures didn’t yet exist. The refiling of these particular ETFs has occurred now that Bitcoin futures contracts do exist and are currently being traded on the CME (NASDAQ:CME) and Cboe (NASDAQ:CBOE) exchanges. There has been no word from the SEC as of yet on the standing of the ETFs and whether or not they will be approved. The consensus among experts, however, is that they will be, or at least one of them will be. Both the CME and CBOE have been having success from their launches of the Bitcoin futures contracts, and the transition has been smooth so far. The likelihood that the NYSE will soon be able to list its ETFs is strong. If SEC does approve the ETFs, it could mark a huge moment for the cryptocurrency world, possibly being the thing to finally push Bitcoin into the mainstream financial world, making it accessible to more people. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $15, 572.60. Featured Image: twitter"
1," Kevin O’Leary, Shark Tank investor and well-known businessman, offered warning and encouragement to Bitcoin investors on an interview on CNBC. Mr. O’Leary gave a stiff warning to those that don’t understand Bitcoin stating that investing in something you don’t fully understand could be potentially disastrous. However, he offered some confidence stating that the digital currency is definitely an asset, if not a usable currency. He said, “I’m quite sure that 99 percent of the people that own Bitcoin do not understand how it works. That always is a cocktail for disaster. You should never invest in something you don’t understand.” O’Leary was clear in expressing his view of Bitcoin not being a sufficient currency at this time for transactions. He pointed out a specific instance in which he was unable to seal a $200,000 transaction due to the other parties’ concern of the high volatility. However, the investor views the digital currency as one of the most successful assets in the world. In his conclusion, he compared Bitcoin more to gambling than an investment and advises investors to only put in how much they are able to afford to lose, saying, “I just think it is a wonderful entertainment, just like a slot machine is, or putting chips on a roulette wheel. Right now it is fun, exciting, entertaining. As long as you can afford to lose everything you put into it, go with it.” Featured Image: CNBC"
1," One year ago, Aaron Shamo was arrested in Utah on multiples drug charges after being involved in a drug ring. At the time authorities seized almost $500,000 of Bitcoin. According to Time Magazine, Shamo was involved in black market synthetic opioid fentanyl sales. Since the seizing, the cryptocurrency has skyrocketed in price and is now worth over $8.5 million and the US Attorney’s Office for Utah wants to sell it off. The court papers cite the reason for the sale as being due to Bitcoin’s high volatility. Historically, the authority that investigates these cases are the ones to keep the funds from the seized assets. The defendant pled not guilty and his attorney is not contesting the sale of the Bitcoins that were seized. Earlier last week, Bulgaria had seized a substantial amount of Bitcoin from a criminal investigation. The country seized over 200,000 Bitcoins which equates to around one-fourth of the country’s national debt or around $4 billion dollars. It remains unclear what the country will do with the cryptocurrency but this might become a trend of central authorities. Featured Image: depositphotos/meepoohyaphoto"
1," A 36-year-old man was arrested yesterday by NYPD for committing cryptocurrency fraud. Marlon Jensen has scratched off most of the Chuck E. Cheese engravings on the coins used for their games and sold them as “bitcoins.” Jensen wrote a “B” on the side of them with a permanent marker, as reported by an officer on the scene. When officers stormed his home they found $1.1 Million of cash inside. As many already know, Bitcoin is a digital currency and has gained monumental mainstream attention this year and is currently selling at $18,695.20 a coin. Although Bitcoin isn’t a physical form of a currency, it hasn’t stopped some from taking advantage of the misinformed, selling various counterfeit bitcoin “gold” coins to make a profit. Michael West, an NYPD officer told the media, “People are retarded, my 8-year-old son would know those weren’t bitcoins and lord knows he’s not the brightest.” Mr. Jensen has been charged with fraud and can face up to 5 years in federal prison.

The Bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate has decreased by -2.64 percent in 24 hours. Week-on-week, Bitcoin is up 13.99 percent, while on a monthly basis, it is up 145.42 percent. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value has just hit another record, breaking the $20,000 mark and outperforming almost everyone’s expectations for its 2017 price.

Even the underlying blockchain technology is now being adopted by many different business sectors, more specifically the major financial institutions. These major banks are exploring ways in which it can be added to their current technology, to save them time and money. As governments continue to scramble to implement policies to ‘regulate’ the digital currencies’, Bitcoin continues to grow.

1," The public has now been informed that Wild Crypto, which is an eGaming platform created solely by blockchain technology, has selected their new CEO: William Trentini. This appointment comes as Wild Crypto prepares to launch in January.  If all goes as planned, there will be a number of gaming and lottery sections for users on the platform, as well as games stemming from notable suppliers. Additionally, those using the platform will be eligible to use tokens – “WILD Tokens” – to play games.  Trentini, with approximately 20 years of experience in the financial sector, will administer the launch. It makes sense that Wild Crypto appointed Trentini considering he has worked with various eGaming and crypto businesses.  Trentini has said that Wild Crypto has been working around the clock to create a product that sets a new standard in blockchain gaming, so only time will tell if that’s true or not. He added that Wild Crypto is both resilient and novel, and he is over the moon to lead this team into further development.  For players looking to use the platform, it will go live on January 20, 2018.  Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Gorodenkoff"

GMO Internet will offer to pay its employees $890 a month in Bitcoin, which is a 10 percent raise to their current salary if they choose to take the crypto option. The company spokeswoman Harumi Ishii explained that “employees can receive salaries in bitcoin if they want to. We hope to improve our own literacy of virtual currency by actually using it.” Actually using it would be a benefit for GMO Internet, as the company joined a Bitcoin trading and exchange business earlier in the year, and is also planning to launch a new cryptocurrency mining operation in future years. This mining operation will utilize “renewable energy and cutting-edge semiconductor chips in Northern Europe.” GMO Internet plans to continue its research into Bitcoin, and is looking to develop both hardware and software for the cryptocurrency.

1," The Alexander Vinnik case in Greece has just taken an interesting turn. As we reported back in November, the Russian cybercrime suspect was awaiting his fate as the U.S and Russia battled for his extradition. Vinnik was arrested back in July when the U.S requested that he be arrested as he was on vacation with his family. He is said to have laundered $4 billion USD worth of Bitcoin through BTC-e.  Vinnik had appealed his extradition to the U.S because his home country, Russia, held him on ridiculously lower charges of laundering 667,000 ruble which is around only $11,500 USD.  Greece’s Supreme Court has now upheld the US request and is supporting the extradition to the North California courts. Vinnik’s lawyer said in an official statement following the ruling stating, “The Supreme Court has in essence accepted that our client should be sent to the United States.” It is now up to the justice minister to decide his ultimate fate, as the two options present radically different legal punishments.   Featured Image: twitter"
1," Tom Lee, who co-founded the Fundstrat market research company, has publicly stated that the price of Bitcoin will only continue to increase. According to Lee, bitcoin will continue to see growth because millennials have taken such an intense interest in it. The strategist has said that the millennial generation will power the currency, comparing it to the way baby boomers helped the stock market in the 80s. On Tuesday, December 12, Lee stated that millennials have taken a liking to not only bitcoin but also social media and digital organizations. “I think what viewers have to appreciate is, this is a millennial story,” Lee said. Back in October of this year, Tom Lee forecasted that the virtual currency will eventually hit the $25,000 mark by the year 2022. These predictions don’t seem that far-fetched either considering during 2017 bitcoin has posted a whopping 1,700% growth, hitting more than $17,00 this month. Additionally, with CME Group’s launch of bitcoin futures, there is a good chance the price of bitcoin will continue to increase. Featured Image: depositphotos/stevanovicigor"
1," Jordan Belfort, the guy that the ‘Wolf of Wall Street’ was based on, has recently voiced his opinion on Bitcoin and the Initial Coin Offerings.  In an interview this week with the Financial Times on CNN, Belfort discussed his thoughts on the world’s first digital currency and the issues he finds with it.  While, he believes there will be further implementation of the digital currency more mainstream he doesn’t see the value of it, due to its limited supply. Belfort talks about the “shorting” that is currently occurring with the Bitcoin futures and believes it will catapult the price and the demand. However, he doubts with the limited supply and due to the possibility of regulations from various places, the digital currency will fall sharply.   The major issue he has with cryptocurrency is the fundraising tactics of initial coin offerings, calling them a “gigantic scam” that will eventually blow up in investors faces. He made a statement pretty profound, as he was found guilty of fraud to stock-market manipulation but he adds that ICOs are, “far worse than anything I was ever doing.” He essentially doesn’t see anything wrong with digital currency or even the fundraising but says that the majority of people don’t have ill intentions but the small amount that do, will ruin it for everyone. He is alongside a lot of individuals comparing the Bitcoin rise to the “Tulip Bulb” crisis in Holland back in the 1960s, pointing out that once people started trading futures of the commodity, it came crashing down.  He does believe that people are able to make some money on this cryptocurrency frenzy but need to be able to “pull” out and not enter again. Ultimately, he believes due to human nature this entire thing will blow up in everyone’s face and gives a clear warning of this. He states that it won’t affect these billionaire investors but will be devastating to the ‘middle-class’ average joes that place their bets on the market. Featured Image: YouBeRelentless"
1," Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Prime Minister, published a video over the internet on Tuesday expressing his views on our current traditional banking systems. He believes that they will eventually become obsolete and that Bitcoin would replace them entirely. Netanyahu bases his entire claim based on blockchain technologies’ trustless nature and the growth the cryptocurrency has seen within the last year.  In the video, the Prime Minister states that banks will eventually become outdated and easily replaced, saying, “Is the fate of banks that they will eventually disappear? Yes. The answer is yes. Does it need to happen tomorrow? And do we need to do it through Bitcoin? That’s a question mark.” The head of the Israeli state also spoke on the roles of banks explaining that their primary reason for existence was to ensure transactions between two people are secure and valid. He also states that the banks control how money is spent and benefit from having that control, at the cost of the transacting parties. Blockchain technology allows users to communicate directly and secures and validates transactions more quickly, in comparison to the traditional banking infrastructure currently.

0," Scott Cutler, eBay’s (NYSE:EBAY) senior vice president, recently announced that his company is seriously considering accepting the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, as a payment method. On the platform itself, there is an array of items that have to do with cryptocurrency from various apparel with bitcoin emblem’s placed on them, mining contracts, hardware wallets and even mining computers. The one major thing missing, is being able to purchase goods in the cryptocurrency.  According to Cutler, the company is not quite there “yet.” This move would be a massive step towards the adoption of the digital currency. However, Steam, an online game retailer, just announced they will no longer accept Bitcoin as a means of purchase on their platform due to time it takes between the customer’s purchase and the company actually receiving the funds.  The difference between Steam and eBay’s platforms is that eBay is a marketplace, and it wouldn’t matter to them which currency is used as long as they receive their fee per transaction. The acceptance of the payment model wouldn’t be that much of a hindrance for the company, as it was for Steam so it’s adoption seems promising.  Craigslist just started accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment on-the-low but didn’t announce its new features to the public. For now, the eBay collaboration is in the idea phase, but with the holiday’s knocking on the door it might happen sooner rather than later. Featured Image: twitter"
0," Craig Wright, the self-proclaimed creator of Bitcoin, claims that 2018 will be the year of Bitcoin Cash. Wright tweeted that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) had everything to gain in 2018; it will have more security, and what it will be capable of achieving will be limitless. He said that 2018 will bring “secure threshold systems to make even web wallets secure.” There will also be an improvement in privacy by making transactions blind, and there will be improved mixers. Wright further said that the BCH team would be spreading the cryptocurrency around the world, getting more people using it and thus driving the price up. When asked if the 2018 roadmap was well planned, Wright tweeted back, “It is well planned. There are many things coming. We are interested in delivering cash to the world. Not a bank settlement system. So, it is all about whether you believe in PayPal 1.5 in BTC or global cash in BCH.” Wright is asking users to come up with merchant solutions to help with the progress of BCH and is expecting a higher user rate of the cryptocurrency with the many new services and businesses climbing on board. The mining pool ViaBTC will be launching a crypto-to-crypto exchange platform that will have a focus on BCH, and there will also be a Bitcoin Cash Visa debit card coming out. Only time will tell whether the new year will bring a new spring to Bitcoin Cash’s step. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© PromesaStudio"
0," Co-owner of the Golden State Warriors and founder of the Social Capital, Chamath Palihapitiya, has just voiced his opinion of the potential growth of Bitcoin in an Interview with CNBC yesterday. The business head invested in the world’s first digital currency back in 2012 and believes the cryptocurrency will rise exponentially in the next twenty years as it more adopted mainstream. His price analysis isn’t far off from many other investors and tech leaders, who have predicted the price of Bitcoin to reach close to the $1 million level. In his interview Palihapitiya explains his predictions as such: “This thing has the potential to be comparable to the value of gold…This is a fantastic hedge and store of value against autocratic regimes and banking infrastructure that we know is corrosive to how the world needs to work properly…I think this thing is a $100,000 a coin in the next 3-4 years, and in the next 20 years will be $1 mln.” The founder’s main argument is that the digital currency offers a cover against the massive problems that could be potentially caused by the world’s current banking structure. If the banks were to fail, like the housing crisis back in 2008, Bitcoin is entirely disconnected from the platform and that’s the exact reason why the digital currency was created in the first place. He ended the interview with the advice to put at least one percent of what you invest into Bitcoin because he believes, it may “save us all.” Featured Image: Depositphotos/© yamabikay"
1," Ron Paul, who is a former Republican Congressman and known gold standard supporter, has announced that he is shocked to hear that roughly half of his Twitter followers would choose to invest in bitcoin over gold.  According to CCN, Ron Paul designed a poll on his Twitter in which he asked his followers where they would invest a $10,000 gift that they could not touch for roughly 10 years. In the poll, Paul let his followers choose from Bitcoin, Gold, Federal Reserve Notes, or 10 year U.S. Treasury Bonds.  The results? More than half of respondents (70,513 users voted) said they would rather invest in bitcoin, while 36% said they would rather invest in gold.  In an interview with Kitco News, Ron Paul disclosed that he was “surprised” by the results that the poll showed. However, he felt a bit better that the majority of people would not entrust their $10,000 investment to a government-connected financial instrument.  Here’s what Paul had to say:  “Of course, bitcoin is very exciting, and it’s booming, but [bitcoin investors] don’t have a long-term perspective. What’s it going to be like in 10 years? Nobody knows. But we have a pretty good idea of where gold will be, in a general sense.” Keep in mind this poll was not scientific, and it was also posted on Twitter, which usually has a young demographic – just like digital currency investors.

1," On Sunday, CBOE (NASDAQ:CBOE) started trading futures on Bitcoin, and on Monday, CBOE’S chief executive called out critics who have said that the exchange’s newly-launched bitcoin futures market was rushed.  Edward Tilly gave an interview to Financial News in which he said that the issues he has received about the futures market, such as those raised by the Futures Industry Association last week, were completely “uncalled for” and that in no way does it reflect the reality of the regulatory approval process.  Here’s what Tilly had to say, “I think letters like that and cheap shots to our regulator, the CFTC, are uncalled for to make it seem this was an overnight self-certification without the proper amount of CFTC involvement. This is just irresponsible. I respect all the concerns that the industry has but when it’s articulated in the way the FIA did, not so much.” For those who don’t know, FIA’s chief executive Walt Lukken said last week that a number of members were worried about the fluctuation surrounding the digital currency’s prices. He also attacked the process that led to CBOE’s futures market launch yesterday evening.  “I think letters like that and cheap shots to our regulator, the CFTC, are uncalled for to make it seem this was an overnight self-certification without the proper amount of CFTC involvement. This is just irresponsible. I respect all the concerns that the industry has but when it’s articulated in the way the FIA did, not so much,” Lukken said. It’s not just Lukken who raised objections either. In fact, a number of issues were raised by Thomas Peterffy who founded Interactive Brokers. Featured Image: twitter"
1," There’s no doubt that the Bitcoin phase has blown up, but now it’s starting to really get out of hand. According to securities regulator Joseph Borg, people have started going as far as taking out mortgages in order to buy Bitcoin. And this, says Borg, is a huge mistake, “This is not something a guy who’s making $100,000 a year, who’s got a mortgage and two kids in college ought to be invested in.” Most recently, Bitcoin was trading at $16,700 on Coinbase. But it’s a volatile industry, its price constantly changing, up and down. There’s not going to be anywhere to hide if the bubble bursts, which some people believe could happen at any moment. That’s not a place you want to be in, especially not with a new mortgage on the line. The Bitcoin craze, increasing since the beginning of the year, might finally be getting out of hand if this is how far people are willing to go to get a piece of the action – and it’s probably going to go even further.

1," Kay Van-Peterson, Saxo Bank’s global macro strategist, has recently stated that he anticipated Bitcoin to reach “$50,000 – $100,000 between the next six to eighteen months.” He spoke to Bloomberg recently and explained that the new influx of large institutional money will be the “catalyst” that pushes Bitcoin’s price higher.  Van-Peterson also believes the other cryptocurrencies could benefit and “do better” in regards to price growth from this. The strategist sees Ethereum being the next candidate for EFTs and the next ‘contender’ in the cryptocurrency arena.  He added, “The astonishing thing – mindblowing if you will – is that you take a step back and look at the price appreciation… a lot of this has happened without traditional institutional money, and that’s basically going to be coming on board over the next six to 18 months.” Bitcoin has had a monumental year, passing most financial analysts predictions for its short-term growth and many are now pondering what could be next for the digital currency. Even Van-Peterson’s prediction back in May of Bitcoin hitting $100,000 within the next ten years, is now less surprising as he has now altered his timeframe for the digital currency. Bitcoin’s price has recovered over the weekend as CBOE’s futures launched successfully, as it is currently selling around the $16,700 mark as it dropped below $13,000 during the weekend.

1," Bitcoin has made its way into mainstream news within the last months and while it launched back in 2009, a new wave of adoption and understanding has catapulted its price in the year of 2017 over 2,000 percent.    Despite the new adoption and influx of investors, the core Bitcoin users remain to be a tight-knit small group. These early adopters, who happen to be a mix of technology devotees and bold entrepreneurs, hold a large majority of the sway of the cryptocurrency.  The holders of large amounts of bitcoin are called “whales” and according to bloomberg, only 1,000 people currently hold 40 percent of all the existing 16,734,762 circulating Bitcoin supply. So, how much control do these 1,000 people really have over the entire Bitcoin market? What happens if one day they decide to cash out, simultaneously or decide to join the futures route? The world’s largest cryptocurrency, recently saw a dip after a monstrous rally as it’s two biggest exchanges went offline after record-breaking traffic. Bitcoin hit around the $19,000 mark before crashing to nearly $14,000 in mere hours, over a 20 percent drop. The reason for this dip was due to fear and others cashing out for bigger profits.  This example of a minor market manipulation shows how just a few thousand coins can make the market move, should large groups decide to buy/sell. Also, this particular manipulation is not exactly coordinated and just all a part of the process but what is there was a coordinated move? Back on November 12th, an undisclosed individual moved almost 25,000 bitcoins, which was worth $159 million at the time, to a specific online exchange. The news broke throughout the community and many traders feared the owner selling that large amount at one time. It never occurred but many within the Bitcoin community feared the potential ramifications of selling of such a large amount of the cryptocurrency at once. Many fear the high volatility of Bitcoin, which is inevitably the only thing that is predictable with its market. There are many, though, that welcome the dip in the cryptocurrency and see it as an opportunity to buy up “discounted” Bitcoins. Thus emphasizing the issue, a coordinated sell-off between the whales could potentially cause a “flood” in the market and the move would manipulate it to a lower price. There have also been rumors of a trader with unlimited money who was personally manipulating the Bitcoin market. There has been no sign of a coordinated strike between these whales, yet. Who knows if they even understand the magnitude of their alliance or if they even know who each other are. Entering this week though, there are dangers lurking as the first round of Bitcoin futures have launched on CBOE. CME is set to the launch their futures contracts on Sunday and NASDAQ in their Q2 in 2018.  These futures allow different sets of Bitcoin investors to enter the market, which could completely make the current Bitcoin whales almost insignificant with the amount of money that could be potentially dumped in. However, with futures trading, there is a protection for a big price drop, and also a big opportunity to profit from either a drop or a rise. This means big incentives for investors to manipulate Bitcoin’s small market, with large amounts of money. Will these Whales also jump on these futures and manipulate its price to gain profit?  We shall see. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Christian"
1," Tomorrow, a hard fork is set to initiate on the Bitcoin blockchain, thus creating Super Bitcoin which its developers claim will “Make Bitcoin great again.” Super Bitcoin, is part of a group of forks that are set to emerge from Bitcoin’s core chain in the month of December. Tomorrow’s fork comes from a Chinese group that is looking to optimize the blockchain with the Lightning network and plans on increasing its block size to 8-MB. The new chain is set for block 498,888, which will occur sometime on Monday, December 12. Developers on the project state their launch was due to the ideas in the Bitcoin community and have expressed on their website, “please remember: this is just an experiment.” The website reads, “We are merely implementing the proposals recommended by the Bitcoin community. Only when we put these talks into actions that we can make Bitcoin great again.” Super Bitcoin will supply 21,210,000 coins which will include 210,000 pre-mined coins.  According to current lists, f2ppol and BTCC will support the fork on their mining pools and 21 exchanges are set to trade the new currency. Featured Image: twitter"
1," Bitcoin has now landed on Wall Street, with a bang.   Source: CoinMarketCap The CBOE Global Market Exchange Inc. launched its Bitcoin futures last night and the world’s largest cryptocurrency saw a 26 percent increase upon the debut. The initial volumes that came into the exchange exceeded expectation and CBOE’s website traffic was pushed to its limits causing major delays and brief outages. Unlike the outages that occurred last week on the Coinbase system, the CBOE outage didn’t cause Bitcoin’s price to fall.   Source: Bloomberg What are Bitcoin futures exactly? Futures trading has been around since the 19th century and it allows two parties to exchange an asset, at a specific price on an agreed upon date in the future. When this contract settles the buyer of the contract receives their payment in the product itself or in cash. These exchanges will halt for brief periods, if the price of the cryptocurrency spikes more than 30 percent, as you can see displayed on the chart above. CBOE and the upcoming CME futures, ill be settled in cash. This is appealing to mainstream investors because they can bet on the price of Bitcoin, without having to hold on the cryptocurrency what-so-ever.  CBOE’s Chief Strategy Officer Jon Deters, told Business Insider, “People will be able to settle in cash. So you can take a speculative position without touching bitcoin itself, which helps make it more attractive to all sorts of folks.” The arrivals of these futures is a huge milestone for the digital currency, as it was once only associated with drug dealing and other illegal activities, by investors.  These futures are anticipated to bring down the high volatility of the cryptocurrency as major institutions and high volumes of money, are involved. Still, the futures and their impact are still a big unknown – as the week progresses and CME launches their contracts next Sunday, we will know soon-enough. Featured Image: twitter"
1," With little information on the fork, experts are calling Bitcoin Platinum a scam, created by a South Korean teenager. Despite Bitcoin Platinum’s official Twitter feed claiming there has been a group of miners, developers, investors, and users ready to hard fork the Bitcoin protocol at block 498,577, little further information has been provided. Bitcoin Platinum has had a vague description from the start. It claimed to use “Satoshi’s original vision of Bitcoin as decentralized electronic cash.” Subsequent tweets from the account have looked to be informal and poorly constructed, offering little information beyond “[Bitcoin] shorting very good.” It has been revealed since that the owner of the Bitcoin Platinum account is a South Korean teenager, who later admitted on Twitter that it was, indeed, a scam. No doubt due to this and other cryptocurrency scams, the South Korean government will begin to regulate the South Korean crypto market. Featured Image: twitter"
1," On December 11, New York-based VanEck, an ETF fund provider, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to develop Bitcoin ETF products that are eligible to trade in cryptocurrency derivatives.  However, this is not the first ETF fund provider to do this. On December 8, Connecticut-based REX filed its own application.  According to the SEC public filing system, neither REX nor VanEck plans on holding onto bitcoins directly. Instead, both firms will trade futures contracts as well as other derivatives products in order to allow potential investors to profit from the fluctuations bitcoin tends to see in price.  While the SEC tends to deny, or just not bother to look at applications from ETF fund providers to develop Bitcoin ETFs, CBOE (NASDAQ:CBOE) just launched their bitcoin futures market on Sunday, and LedgerX just rolled out a number of other derivatives products.

1," On Sunday evening, Bitcoin prices surged as soon as the Cboe Futures Exchange commenced trading futures on the digital currency. The Cboe exchange rolled out the futures under the stock ticker symbol ‘XBT’. As of 6 p.m. New York time, bitcoin was at $14,890 and then proceeded to jump to $15,500.13 as of 7:17 p.m. on the Coinbase exchange. In early trading on the Cboe, the new futures were at $15,860, which is up 2.6%. Even though things turned sour around 7 p.m. New York time, the digital currency quickly made a comeback. Here’s what JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, had to say about Sunday’s news: “So far, trading has been smooth. I think that was the biggest worry for people. We’ve been trading for about an hour and more than 700 contracts have been traded. So, I’d say this is a successful launch.” Up until this point bitcoin had been primarily owned and traded by entrepreneurs, but now, the launch allows for institutional investors to buy into the digital currency space.

0," On Friday, a parcel bomber in Germany asked for a ransom of €10 million. And the bomber wanted it to be paid in the form of digital currency Bitcoin.  The bomber reportedly sent a message to a pharmacy located next to the Potsdam Christmas market in which he used the worldwide delivery company DHL to demand the €10 million ransom.  German Police are on the lookout for witnesses to the bomb threat, and already investigating it as both a bomb threat and an extortion case. According to the German police force, there is speculation that the package bomb was dropped at the local packing station in Potsdam. They are currently looking for suspects close to the Berlin area.  To no surprise, the entire police force throughout Germany is on high alert. They have asked the public to remain watchful as they continue their investigation into what really happened on Friday, December 8.  This is not the first time someone has asked for their ransom to be paid in the digital currency. In fact, it seems to be a popular route to take for blackmailers in Germany.

0," According to the Winklevoss twins, the market value for bitcoin has the potential to exceed trillions of dollars in the forthcoming years.  Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss told CNBC that bitcoin properties allow the digital currency to act as a premier store of value in orders of magnitude. Cameron Winklevoss explained in the interview that:  “We’ve always felt that bitcoin, given its properties, is gold 2.0 — it disrupts gold. Gold is scarce, bitcoin is actually fixed. Bitcoin is way more portable and way more divisible.”  Additionally, Cameron noted that if the currency can continue to disturb the gold market, it is on the path to reach a trillion dollars in a very small time frame, seeing as the market value for the currency is already verging $300 billion.  Not only that, but the twins stated that other cryptocurrencies don’t stand a chance against the virtual currency and are not a competition in any way. “Bitcoin is not competing with those other currencies. It is competing with gold. Bitcoin is the oldest, it has the first mover advantage and there’s tremendous liquidity.”  For those who don’t know, this digital currency has transformed the financial industry around the world. If the market can maintain this growth over the course of the next few years, there is a good chance it will move into the gold industry. Featured Image: twitter  "
0," Andreas Antonopoulos, who has spent a great deal of his life informing the public about bitcoin, has been given more than $1.6 million by the bitcoin community.  Let me explain further:  For years, Andreas Antonopoulos has been present at conferences and events in the hopes of informing the world about bitcoin, a digital currency. And just last week, Antonopoulos revealed that while he might be an influential figure in the cryptocurrency sector, he is still dealing with debts in US dollars.  “My small savings that I do have are invested in bitcoin. 100 percent [of it]. I actually have a tiny debt in US dollars that I’m still trying to pay off so it is more than 100 percent in bitcoin. Now, I’d like to emphasize again, that is not a recommendation to invest. Because I haven’t invested by money in bitcoin, I invested my career, my intellectual capacity, my creativity energy, my passion, and my work in bitcoin. The money is the least of the investment that I have made in bitcoin and I could lose everything of it and I’d still have everything else,” he said.  Then, on December 5, investor Roger Ver stated that if Antonopoulos invested $300 five years, he would be a millionaire today. Antonopoulos simply responded:  “I did invest, Roger. Then I sold in 2013 to pay my rent. I didn’t have disposable income to work for two years without pay and invest at the same time. I should’ve gone into more debt, but that would have been irresponsible towards my family who I supported.” As a result of Ver’s statement, the bitcoin community asked bitcoin supports to show their loyalty and support to Andreas Antonopoulos, the man who helped get the virtual currency the recognition it deserves. Within 48 hours, the community raised over $1.6 million for the highly respected public figure. Featured Image: twitter  "
0," Alan Greenspan, the former US Federal Reserve chairman, recently was in the news for stating that Bitcoin can be easily compared to a very early form of money in the US called the “continental currency” that was started back in the mid-18th century during the American Revolution. This form of money was introduced to the US back in 1775 and eventually was deemed completely worthless by 1782. Greenspan spoke to CNBC recently and made claims that the Bitcoin, the world’s first digital currency, is irrational and feels it will have the same fate as the Continental currency did. During that time, the currency was not supported by any sort of commodity. Even though the currency has no apparent value, it was still used to create goods and services. The former chairman urges that this is the current state of Bitcoin. He said, “Bitcoin is really a fascinating example of how human beings create value and is not always rational … It is not a rational currency in that case.” The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value has gained thousands of dollars in value over the last few days. As per CoinMarketCap and at press-time, Bitcoin is selling at $15,919.30 up over 20 percent in just 48 hours.  The monumental trajectory of Bitcoin’s price this year has caused many senior financial officers to speak up, such as JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon who has called Bitcoin both a “fraud” and a bubble. Dimon also has said, “It’s worse than tulip bulbs. It won’t end well. Someone is going to get killed.” Featured Image: twitter"
1," Back in May, Bulgarian’s law enforcement seized 200,000 bitcoins as they cracked down on organized crime in their country. Their government is now sitting on $3.5 billion USD, at today’s Bitcoin price. Back on May 19th of this year, a press release was sent out by the Southeast European Law Enforcement Center (SELEC) stating that a total of 213,519 Bitcoins were seized that month. The regional organization that seized these digital coins were composed of 12 states including Bulgaria. During the seizure, 23 Bulgarian nationals were detained and had been apart of an alleged customs fraud scam.  According to CoinMarketCap and at press-time, Bitcoin is selling at $17,551.10 per coin.  Per the press release, authorities stated, “The offenders choose the bitcoin way of investing/saving the money, because it is rather difficult to be tracked and followed.” The added that those that were involved hacked into Bulgarian customs with a virus, skipping paying the fees to import goods into the country. Government agents were bribed by the perpetrators and the virus was uploaded by them.   Overall, they dodged paying 10 million leva (Bulgaria’s currency) which is world nearly $6 million USD. At this time, what remains unknown is what the Bulgarian government is doing with the Bitcoins that were seized. According to Bivol.bg, the government declined to disclose further details on the subject due to the ongoing investigation. According to a report from Bivol.bg from Nov. 28, the Bulgarian government declined to release further details, citing an ongoing criminal investigation. Featured Image: twitter"
1," Valve will no longer be accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment on Steam. The company claims that the cryptocurrency has become “untenable” due to its extremely high transaction fees and the high level of instability in its value. Valve explained its decision, “In the past few months we’ve seen an increase in the volatility in the value of Bitcoin and a significant increase in the fees to process transactions on the Bitcoin network. For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled Bitcoin). These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of Bitcoin itself drops dramatically.” Bitcoin value goes through extreme fluctuations over the course of very little time, making transactions difficult and irritating. If a transaction is ongoing at the time of a change in Bitcoin’s value, the amount required to complete the purchase may reflect something different at the end of the transaction than what the user originally started with. With the recent surge of Bitcoin increasing $1000 in 24 hours, Valve has seen more and more customers getting stuck in this scenario. When this happens, Valve either refunds the overpaid amount, or the customer is required to pay additional funds. In either scenario, the customer is faced with an additional Bitcoin transaction fee from the original one connected with the purchase. “With the transaction fee being so high right now, it is not feasible to refund or ask the customer to transfer the missing balance (which itself runs the risk of underpayment again, depending on how much the value of Bitcoin changes while the Bitcoin network processes the additional transfer),” commented Valve. Valve has decided the hassle isn’t worth it anymore, and that it is affecting user experience, so Bitcoin payment will no longer be a part of its gaming experience. Valve has said that it may reintroduce Bitcoin as payment later on in the future, if the cryptocurrency ever stabilizes, but for now, Bitcoin is out. Featured Image: twitter"
1," Wall Street banks are saying ‘no’ to the Bitcoin futures contracts, claiming that the finance system isn’t ready for continuing rising prices. Two Bitcoin futures will be launching in December: the Chicago-based exchange, Cboe Global Markets on the 10th, and CME Group on the 18th. Nasdaq won’t be far behind, already planning a launch for the beginning of 2018, while the Tokyo Financial Exchange has also reported that it will be launching its own Bitcoin derivatives futures product. These announcements have been met with criticism from the major brokers. The Futures Industry Association, which is made up of banks including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), claims that the implementation of Bitcoin futures contracts “did not allow for proper public transparency and input.” The fact that Cboe and the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) have agreed to function under a self-certified regime for their contracts has led to little satisfaction, due to that fact that a self-certification regime for “these novel products does not align with the potential risks that underlie their trading and should be reviewed.” The main issue for members of the Futures Industry Association is the reliability of prices underlying the Bitcoin futures contracts. Bitcoin price is constantly fluctuating, and while it has moved up quickly this past month, more than 50%, the qualms are that it would also be capable of falling just as quickly and drastically.

1," The Bitcoin marketplace NiceHash has been hacked, and over $64 million dollars worth of Bitcoin has been stolen in a matter of moments. On Wednesday, several NiceHash users reported some unusual activity in their BTC wallets, several of them found their wallets to be completely empty. Soon after these reports, NiceHash announced that it would be temporarily closing for maintenance. 12 hours after the service went offline for this maintenance, NiceHash released a statement saying that they had experienced a security breach which was compromising their payment services and that the service would continue to be closed for the next 24 hours while they investigated the situation.  source: thehackernews Several users began tweeting NiceHash, saying that their money had been stolen. “Either I got hacked or something is up,” tweeted Erik Callesen, showing an outgoing transaction of $56 million he claims to have not made. NiceHash has not confirmed the total amount of Bitcoin that was stolen, however, CoinDesk has reported that as much as 4,736.42 in Bitcoins were stolen, which at the time of the report was worth over $62 million. With the jump that Bitcoin price has recently taken, the total amount of Bitcoin stolen could be as much as $70 million now, if not more. There have been several fingers pointed at a particular Bitcoin wallet address that, when it opened on Tuesday at 9:07 pm, went from a balance of 0.01 Bitcoin to a balance of 4,655.25 Bitcoin in just ten minutes, with over 3,000 transactions made by the user – and the number has climbed since. Confirmation has been made by RT America after looking into the suspicious activity reported by the users claiming to have been hacked, and it looks like their money was indeed transferred to the mysterious Bitcoin wallet address. NiceHash has commented that they have begun an investigation into the matter, and that “relevant authorities and law enforcement” have been notified. They are “co-operating with them as a matter of urgency.” NiceHash head of marketing Andrej P. Škraba has said that the hack was “a highly professional attack with sophisticated social engineering.” Despite this, the company assures its users that it is “fully committed to restoring the NiceHash service with the highest security measures at the earliest opportunity.” However, how the company will be able to rectify matters if total compensation is unable to be achieved remains up in the air. In the meantime, NiceHash is encouraging users to change their passwords, both on their NiceHash accounts as well as on other services. Featured Image: twitter"

Coinbase’s partner exchange GDAX, also went down simultaneously. It only took two hours for the developers to get the website up and running, much faster than the last time around. Bitcoin’s price shot up so quickly, most price trackers weren’t even able to track it’s price accurately.

News of the upcoming Bitcoin futures seems to have reached a large enough audience, as it seems that investors have decided to join the movement just before the official launch. Many skeptics and high ranking banking officials have been voicing their opinions for months on bitcoin being just a “bubble” but the cryptocurrency continues to make comebacks after slight downfalls and keeps breaking records along the way.  When will said “bubble” finally pop, if ever? December 10th shall be the test, as the original cryptocurrency will be brought mainstream. Featured Image: dimdimich"
1," Bitcoin has now reached the $13,000 mark early this morning, and many analysts are still looking into why the digital token continues to break its own records. The results may have nothing to do with the cryptocurrency itself but more so about the latest nominee at the Federal Reserve (The Fed). Marvin Goodfriend, has been called the ‘worst Fed nominee in History’ and a visionary by various news sources. However,  Still, the newest addition to the Fed may be contributing greatly to the rise of Bitcoin. Goodfriend’s anti-cash views are the first of its kind, from a person in his position.  The new representative had voiced his opinions that paper money puts financial freedom in the hands of the people, a plot that he does not like if a crisis were to occur. During such crisis, the Fed usually lowers interest rates for individuals, in order to increase the borrowing power for consumers and small businesses. The issue is that if the Fed were to lower interest rates to something close to zero on checking and savings accounts, people now have the power to simply withdraw physical money from their accounts to stop the potential of them losing money. Goodfriend, does not like this freedom to protect the value of money and believes that cash is the limiting factor that holds back the power of the Fed from controlling the economy.  This rigid monetary stance might be the cause of the recent spike in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Should such stiff government policies come into existence, digital currencies might present a better method for trading and interact with currency that would be completely out of the Federal Reserve’s control. This is the exact reason why Bitcoin was created in the first place, back in 2008.  Obviously, there have been other factors in the rise of Bitcoin but Goodfriend’s remarks and opinions may have boosted its price unintentionally.  Featured Image: Depositphotos/© tanarch"
1,"   The UK native superstar, Lilly Allen has been topping the charts since back in 2006 and hasn’t let off the steam since. Although she has become somewhat of a singing legend, she still has her regrets just like you and me. It turns out that the 32-year-old once turned down a performance where she was offered hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin, for her to sing. She tweeted back in 2014, calling herself an “idiot” for turning down the gig back in 2009. If you’ve seen any of the headlines, Bitcoin has grown to phenomenal amounts this year and is now selling at £9,810.10 ($13,127 USD), per coin. If she would have accepted the gig and held onto the cryptocurrency, her digital wallet would be worth over £1.68 billion. This would have made her one of the richest individuals worldwide in showbusiness, passing Madonna and Beyonce by a substantial amount. Featured Image: facebook"
1," As Bitcoin gains popularity all over the world, more individuals are now starting to sell their more lucrative items in exchange for the digital currency.  The rental housing market and now even airlines have begun accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment method. It seems now that this is being applied to collector‘s items, such as luxury automobiles. A car owner in the U.K has now listed his Gold Ghost Rolls-Royce for sale on the major website Autotrader but is only selling it in Bitcoin and not in pounds. If you were to buy a brand new Rolls-Royce from the dealership it would cost you over £230,000 but with only 35,000 kilometers, this 2010 would only cost you £117,000 in Bitcoin. The owner told the Daily Mail, “Why not trade in Bitcoin? I treat it in exactly the same way as normal currency these days. It’s safe, convenient and incredibly valuable right now so, to me, it makes sense to trade my car this way. It’s the future.” This Ghost model will also come with a personalized number plate, for an additional fee. It comes with a 6.6-liter engine and the Gold car has all the luxurious specs to match its price tag. At the beginning of 2017, if you would have invested just £12,000 and kept it, you would now be able to purchase this beautiful Rolls-Royce. As Bitcoin futures are just around the corner, the demand for the cryptocurrency is almost certain to grow. Whether or not people decide to invest long or short term in the digital currency, once the futures hit the market in full force a flood of new investors are anticipated to flood the market.  As the demand continues to grow, everyday transactions with the digital currency will become more of the norm. Featured Image: autotrader"
1," Back in 2009, James Howell entered the cryptocurrency space and was able to accumulate 7,500 Bitcoin. Eventually, his girlfriend made him give it up, as the blockchain mining hardware was far too noisy for her liking. At the time, it wasn’t a huge loss. The British IT worker ended up selling most of the mining equipment for scraps after he accidentally spilled lemonade all over them. Howell did, however, keep the hard drive with the keys to his digital wallet for a few years before eventually throwing it in the trash, yikes.  Currently, one bitcoin is now trading for just under $13,000 USD which would’ve made him up a ‘mere’ $96 million. Now, the money just sits in a random landfill somewhere. Howell joked about digging it up back in 2013 to the Guardian but is now making plans to dig it up.  “A modern landfill is a complex engineering project and digging one up brings up all sorts of environmental issues such as dangerous gasses and potential landfill fires. It’s a big, expensive and risky project.” Howell is not certain which trash mound holds his long-lost fortune and who knows, it may not even be salvageable if he does find it but he intends on trying.

The famously successful entrepreneur remains open to it but is still unsure about the long-term stability of cryptocurrency. Based off this interview, Levchin clearly expressed the power that blockchain technology holds and how far it will reach but he doesn’t see a certainty with Bitcoin. Levchin said, “I invest in things that I have a strong, long-term point of view on and Bitcoin I’m still trying to figure out.” Many others have been in the new praising the underlying blockchain technology but knocking the cryptocurrency that runs on the blockchain. Huge financial leaders such as the president of Mastercard have implied of the bright future of the technology of the blockchain but don’t necessarily include Bitcoin in the mix. Levchin also added, “I think a form of a Blockchain technology, Bitcoin or otherwise will be essential and will not go away. Not only that, it will continue advancing and being used in many different industries from financial technology to medicine. But it’s not clear to me whether Bitcoin itself is the great long-term investment.” Despite the negative comments against the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin continues to break all-time high records and is now selling over $11,800.

1," If you’re an owner of Bitcoin and get into traffic issues in South Africa, fear not, because the country now lets you pay your traffic fines with Bitcoin. The South African traffic fines administrator, Fines4U, allows clients to pay any outstanding fines in Bitcoin. However, there will be no POS system or direct QR payments; rather, this is an example of a business looking to accumulate Bitcoin without risking the direct investment in it. Fines4U is the intermediary between companies and individuals who need to pay the fine and the government agency charging the fine. Fines4U gets the money from one to the other, managing traffic fines for about 500 companies and 8,000 individuals. Cornelia van Niekerk, the founder of Fines4U, has personally invested in Bitcoin, so her new plan is to accept Bitcoin payments from clients and have the Bitcoin be deposited into her own personal wallet. Then, she will pay the fines through the business using local currency, and deposit money back into her business from her own finances. In this way, she gets the Bitcoin directly from the clients, and her business keeps its income through her personal finances. For clients wishing to take advantage of this offer, the outstanding amount of their traffic fines will be calculated, and then they will be presented with the amount in Bitcoin, which will be valid for a limited period.

1," Bitcoin has been going back and forth between the praisers who claim that Bitcoin will only continue to rise and doubters who believe the market’s going to crash. It’s hard to tell who is going to be right, but if it is the doubters, there are a lot of people who are going to lose a lot – unless of course, something was to warn them of any impending crash. That’s the intention of the Bitcoin Bubble Burst app. The app was developed to scan Bitcoin markets, news, and social media platforms and to signal the user if any of these platforms indicate a potential market crash in the future. The app provides real-time price change alerts to users by using algorithms based on Bitcoin price change data. Could this really be the saving grace investors are looking for? Maybe, but it’d be best to view it with a grain of salt and investors may not want to use it as their main decision maker in regards to Bitcoin and its future. Any number of things could go wrong with the scanning or reporting system, and a large number of bad news reports could trigger sell-off messages on the app, and others like it, which could actually cause the very situation they are trying to predict. However, developers are optimistic: “Utilizing sentiment analytics we can get a numeric picture of the current event. Our model learns which patterns are ‘odd’ and when to contact you via notification.” If nothing else, the app and its counterparts will be useful in monitoring real-time data from a broad domain of exchanges and the worldwide trade of Bitcoin, and it will be good to have a regulated system for monitoring the very quick value changes of Bitcoin.

Users of the airline can pay for their seats with either cryptocurrency through a mobile app, and their monthly membership program, which allows members to fly as many times as they want, will also be accepting crypto payments for its monthly fee. Coinbase will be handling all the payments for the company. CEO Sudhin Shahani said that the move to accept Bitcoin and Ethereum is a part of their wider efforts to disrupt air services. “Digital currency has been on our radar from the very beginning and we are excited to provide our members with another quick and seamless way to do business with Surf Air,” he said. There are many other small airlines that are doing as Surf Air has done, some taking it even further by looking into the applications of blockchain and how they may be beneficial to ticket disbursement and maintenance tracking.

1," This past month major Bitcoin future contracts have been approved on two large exchanges and as a result, Bitcoin’s price has reached all-time records. According to a few cryptocurrency analysts, this addition may produce a platform for a large pending ‘short’ market. As Bitcoin has high volatility and the potential to fall, it could lead to a massive number of certain investors taking those ‘short’ positions.  In a recent article published by Bloomberg, hedge funds may force some massive pressure and begin to take advantage of what they see as potentially the “greatest shorting opportunity in history.” Lou Kern, a Flight VC partner and long-time cryptocurrency investor stated:  According to cryptocurrency investor Lou Kerner, a partner at Flight VC: “[It may be] one of the greatest shorting opportunities ever. You have a lot of zealotry, and a lot of people, including me, who think it’s the greatest thing to ever happen in the history of mankind. You have a lot of people who think it’s a bubble and a Ponzi scheme. It turns out both of them can’t be right.” The addition of Bitcoin futures into the market will have major impacts into bringing mainstream investment money into the cryptocurrency space, where it’s long or short. Regardless of the price, Bitcoin’s overall ecosystem should begin to stabilize considerably with the influx of investors. If a large amount of money were to move into the short position and Bitcoin’s price was to rise, the results could become the largest ‘short squeeze’ of all-time. So what’s a ‘short squeeze’, you ask? This squeeze takes place when a densely shorted stock rises in price, which then forces short contract holders to “squeeze” out of their short positions at a loss and thus driving the price father up with heightened pressure.

1," Bitfinex is the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, with a $657 million daily trading volume, but recently there have been some false allegations floating around the crypto world against Bitfinex – and they are finally taking action against the firestarters. The exchange intends to sue. The exchange’s in-house counsel Stuart Hoegner has said that there were some “bad actors” spreading “false information” to “agitate the cryptocurrency ecosystem.” “To date, every claim made by these bad actors has been patently false and made simply to agitate the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As a result,  has decided to assert all of its legal rights and remedies against this agitator and his associates,” said Hoegner. The identities of these false information spreaders have been withheld, but Bitfinex public relations executive Ronn Torossian has said of the matter, “I think you can infer who.” Torossian further commented, “In recent months, certain parties and their associates have made false and unsubstantiated claims against Bitfinex, engaging in potential market manipulation activity that is dishonest and unlawful.” The inference we are meant to make, it would seem, is Bitfinex’ed, as they released a statement claiming that the lawsuit against Bitfinex will be defended. “I am officially seeking donations to defend myself against Bitfinex’s frivolous lawsuit, rather than showing their numbers they seek to silence me,” wrote Bitfinex’ed.

1," The central bank of Indonesia intends to ban cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin in 2018. The country’s central bank, Bank Indonesia (BI), plans on banning all forms of cryptocurrency, their trading, and their usage in transactions as payments. This is so that the country’s own currency, the rupiah, can maintain its sovereignty as Indonesia’s legal tender. The governor of BI, Agus Martowardojo, said, “We [will] also prevent arbitrage opportunities, unhealthy business practices and business controls by parties outside the legal reach of Indonesia’s laws that could damage the structure of industries here.” This announcement occurred relatively soon after Indonesia’s financial regulator urged retail investors to keep away from the “lure” of cryptocurrencies. The chairman of Indonesian Task Force under the Financial Services Authority, Tongam Tobing, added, “We urge you to invest in logic, not Bitcoin, so people do not go there…People, if you want to invest, do not invest in virtual money, but invest in the legal [assets] that can improve the economy of Indonesia.” Featured Image: twitter"
1," Bitcoin can’t occur without Bitcoin mining, and mining can’t occur without electricity – 31 terawatt-hours worth of electricity. With Bitcoin surging to $11,000, the demand on the power supply caused by mining has also surged. It has been estimated that Bitcoin and Bitcoin Gold, combined, has had 31 terawatt-hours climb in annual electricity consumption. In November, with Bitcoin’s climb towards record-breaking numbers, Bitcoin mining power consumption increased by almost 30%. Based on the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index designed by Digiconomist, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash mining are using a total of 0.13% of the global energy consumption, making the combined mining operation the 61st highest power consumer in the World. If the mining demand for electricity continues at its current rate, mining will consume all of the world’s electricity supply by 2020. Featured Image: twitter"
1," Miners who once thought Bitcoin hydro mining and mining via phone was new and exciting have now just been proved wrong, the owner of a Tesla S is now mining Bitcoin’s from his vehicle’s free supercharger. How achieved this, was installing a Bitcoin mining computer in the trunk of his car and is charged by the car’s battery while it mines the cryptocurrency. This is a new and innovative way to mine Bitcoin that has never been done before and what makes it so lucrative is that the there is no cost to mine the cryptocurrency, as energy bills have said to be pretty expensive. The only cost associated with this process would be the car itself and the equipment to do the mining. New creative methods of mining will continue to arise as the world’s largest cryptocurrency, continues to increase in its price. While the use of the superchargers in the electric vehicles could be an awesome workaround to paying the high electricity bills associated with mining, owners could face potential issues with their cars.  Among one of the biggest concerns would be that the mining computers produce an abundant amount of heat and that could potentially damage the car’s internal parts over an extended period of time. Also, the car’s battery remains untested and could become damaged when it’s used continuously for a period of time, during the mining process. Despite the good amount of profit that could be made with the mining, Tesla owners should weigh the potential effects it may have on the performance of their not-so-cheap cars. Those wanting to save some money mining the digital currencies are encouraged to explore alternative methods such as renewable energies and they could use solar panels instead.

1," Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high yesterday but it seems today it has lost some of its momentum. Yesterday, BTC hit a monumental all-time high of $11,858.70 at 20:24:12 UTC. The cryptocurrency is now trading at $11,418.70, down -3.15 percent in 24 hours but up 17 percent for the week. For the month, Bitcoin is up 55.7 percent and for the year, it is up 1378.6 percent.  Source: CoinMarketCap As per the chart above, you can see Bitcoin has had a rather inconsistent week. On Wednesday of last week, Bitcoin and Ethereum both hit record highs simultaneously and the influx of users on two main cryptocurrency exchanges at that time completely shut them down. Both Coinbase and Gemini systems were not prepared for the amount of traffic they received that day and had to undergo system upgrades which temporarily locked out its users from the system. BTC’s price dropped -16 percent in just a matter of hours but quickly rebounded Friday. With the upcoming Bitcoin futures set to launch on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in exactly two weeks, BTC’s current price will most likely see a lot of volatility as the future for the futures is unknown.

It is important to mention that there have been numerous risk management tools incorporated into the company’s bitcoin futures trading service.  In an official announcement, Duffy said:  “Though we have worked through a lengthy, comprehensive process with the CFTC to get to this point, we recognize bitcoin is a new, uncharted market that will continue to evolve, requiring continued collaboration with the Commission and our clients going forward. At launch, our new Bitcoin futures contract will be subject to a variety of risk management tools, including an initial margin of 35 percent, position and intraday price limits, and a number of other risk and credit controls that CME Group offers on all of its products.” Featured Image: depositphotos/apoint  "
1," Bitcoin’s price just surpassed the $11,700 mark, and yet, billionaire Ken Griffin has decided to join the conversation that compares the digital currency’s price increase to the Dutch Tulip Bulb Market Bubble, which ended in 1637.  In an interview with CNBC, Ken Griffin declared that bitcoin is as popular as it is in our modern world because society is confusing it with blockchain technology, which, according to Griffin, serves more purpose and has merit.  Based on Griffin’s take on the matter, blockchain technology is likely to have overpowering social implications in the forthcoming years. Additionally, Griffin stated that blockchain technology takes away the need for third parties as it creates safe, fast, and permanent transaction records.  The problem, to Griffin, is that people don’t know the difference between blockchain technology and bitcoin, which is causing individuals to purchase the digital currency without a clue as to what they are actually buying.  Unlike other financial experts, Griffin does not believe bitcoin is a fraud, but he does appearing to be sticking to the fact that bitcoin is a bubble that will inevitably hurt society. This, of course, is not the first team bitcoin has been referred to as a ‘bubble’.  For those who don’t know, Ken Griffin founded the Citadel hedge fund management firm, which now holds over $27B in assets. Currently, according to Forbes, Griffin’s net worth sits at around $8.6B.

1," John McAfee has officially increased his 2020 bitcoin price target to $1 million. It is a bet that will leave bitcoin pessimists hoping that he is right about his forecast of the direction that the digital currency is heading in.  For those who don’t know, McAfee is the latest addition to the MGT Capital Investments team, and he joined as chief cybersecurity visionary right as the MGT Capital made their transition into the world of the blockchain.  The former Libertarian presidential candidate tweeted the following about the currency:  “When I predicted Bitcoin at $500,000 by the end of 2020, it used a model that predicted $5,000 at the end of 2017. BTC has accelerated much faster than my model assumptions. I now predict Bitcoin at $1 million by the end of 2020. I will still eat my dick if wrong.” While it is quite the statement, one cannot help but wonder if he is correct in his prediction. Meanwhile, others are wondering if McAfee should have even increased his bitcoin price target in the first place, considering others have claimed the currency is just a bubble. Over the course of the past few months, McAfee has become much more vocal about the digital currency, even stating that he forecasts BTC and BCH fighting for the “Bitcoin” name.

1," On Sunday, in what seems to be a rebound from a 20% drop last week, Bitcoin soared to surpass the $11,700 mark, which means the digital currency just reached a new record high. According to CoinDesk, the virtual currency reached an all-time high of $11,773.83 on Sunday, December 3. For perspective, that’s almost $2,753 (30.5%) from a low of $9,021.85 reached on Thursday. As one might have guessed, Sunday’s recovery proves just how volatile bitcoin can be. Don’t believe me? Check out the currencies stats from this week: on Tuesday, bitcoin crossed the $10,000 figure, and on Wednesday, the digital currency surpassed $11,000, only to drop $1,000 in a matter of hours. It seems most people have their own opinion on the cryptocurrency but no one really knows the direction it is heading in. On November 27, former Fortress hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz said the currency could hit $40,000 at the end of next year, only to change his mind on Tuesday and say that bitcoin is “going to be the biggest bubble of our lifetimes.” Regardless of where Bitcoin is heading in the future, today’s new high gives investors worldwide a reason to celebrate.  Featured Image: depositphotos/Syda_Productions"
1," Currently, the United States Senate Judiciary Committee is dealing with working out the kinks of the proposed bill S.1241. The aim of the bill? To criminalize the deliberate suppression of control or ownership of a financial account.  Additionally, bill S.1241 will modify the definition of both ‘financial institution’ and ‘financial account’ to include cryptocurrencies and their exchanges. According to Senator Dianne Feinstein, bill S.1241 is essential in order to update existing AML laws.  As mentioned, the proposed bill will alter the definition of ‘financial institution.’ The definition will be changed in Section 53412(a) of title 31 to include:  “An issuer, redeemer, or cashier of prepaid access devices, digital currency, or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency.” If things go as planned and bill S.1241 is passed, it will likely have effects for anyone using cryptocurrencies in the United States and out of the country.  There are a number of industry experts who have raised their opinions on bill S.1241. In fact, Tone Vays has said that he forecasts there to be a faceoff between the holders and users of Bitcoin and the United States government.  “It’s bad…I think it’s gonna end in a very confrontational way between Bitcoin—even Bitcoin holders and users—and the US Government.” Further, there have been a couple reports that have surfaced which suggest that the White House is monitoring digital currencies. While some might not be too worried about those reports, others believe this is yet another attempt at maintaining control over the decentralized system.  Featured Image: depositphotos/sepavone  "
1," Think you’ve got problems? Well, here’s another one: the White House is keeping a close eye on digital currencies – and that includes bitcoin. Do you know why this is a problem? It’s because this means the White House is trying to find a way to control the decentralized monetary system. On Thursday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, White House Press Secretary, announced during a press conference that bitcoin is “something that is being monitored by our team.” Her statement comes after a Buzzfeed reporter asked her whether or not Trump believes the currency should have more regulatory attention from the government.  Sanders added, “In terms of specific briefings and announcements on it, I don’t have anything that I can share with you right now.”  She also said Homeland Security has talked to President Trump about the matter recently. “Tom Bossert, with the Homeland Security team, an advisor to the president, has brought this up in a meeting earlier this week,” Sanders said.”I know this is something he is keeping an eye on.” When asked about Sanders’ press conference, billionaire hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz told Fox Business that “Ms. Sanders probably had prepared for the question and I’m sure Homeland Security is looking at it, the Treasury has looked at it, the Fed has looked at it.” While Trump has never actually talked about bitcoin publicly, we do know that he has a few pro-bitcoin contacts in his black book.

1," On Thursday, Dr. Joseph Stiglitz said cryptocurrencies – more specifically bitcoin – should be banned. The following day, Robert J. Shiller opened up on the subject of the digital currency. And it’s not pretty.  Shiller believes that bitcoin will inevitably crash, and when it does, it will bear a resemblance to what happened to the stock market after the Great Depression. Additionally, the economist likened the appeal of the currency to a “mystery movie.” What does that mean? Well, because it has a certain appeal to it; it attracts anyone hoping to pull a fast one on the system.  For those who don’t know, Shiller was the recipient of the Nobel Prize in 2013. Plus, he predicted the housing bubble and the dot-com, so it’s no wonder people listen to him.  During a conference in Lithuania this week Shiller stated:  “Bitcoin, it’s just absolutely exciting ( …) You’re fast. You’re smart. You’ve figured out nobody else understands. You’re with it. And bitcoin has this anti-government, anti-regulation feel. It’s such a wonderful story. If it were only true.” He also noted that he doesn’t know if, when, or where bitcoin is going to end.  With that being said, despite having spot-on predictions in the past, Shiller might be wrong about bitcoin as there doesn’t seem, thus far, to be any sort of data that supports a crash. I mean, it wasn’t that long ago that Bitcoin surpassed the $11,400 mark, right? Featured Image: twitter"
1," The much-awaited news was confirmed this Friday morning, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commision has finally approved Bitcoin futures trades on three different exchanges. In a statement released by the CFTC this morning, they announced the CBOE Futures Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange self-certified their new contracts for Bitcoin futures. Also, the Canto exchange has self-certified a contract for Bitcoin binary options. To clarify what the means, the ‘futures’ make it available to bet on Bitcoin’s price without having to buy the digital currency. Both exchanges have confirmed that their futures will settle in cash. Bitcoin has grown over 1,300 percent this year, due to growing interest from a wealthy manager and big retail traders. If these futures run smoothly, it could open the door for wider adoption among Wall Street.  The decision made by the CFTC this morning also came with a warning, they cautioned others due to the market being highly unsupervised. CFTC’s Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo said in the statement,  “Bitcoin, a virtual currency, is a commodity unlike any the Commission has dealt with in the past.”  Since the announcement, CME rose 1.7 percent and reached an all-time high this Friday morning. However, CBOE’s stock trades have changed very little today. From it’s original launch date of December 11th, CME has announced today from their website that they will begin on Monday, December 18. CBOE has yet to announce a specific date but a spokesperson from the exchange told CNBC that it will “probably” happen before the end of the year. The person states, “We are operationally ready and we will be announcing a launch date shortly.” There has been various reports lately that Nasdaq has plans of launching their own Bitcoin futures around June of 2018. A spokesperson from the exchange told CNBC that it would “base its price off of 50 Bitcoin sources from around the world.” CME is only using four sources and CBOE is only using one source, for their futures. If December 18th goes well, it could become a rat race for larger exchanges to adopt these futures.  Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Victor_DVA"
1," Bitcoin broke $10,000 this week, in what seems like a skyrocketed advance from its $1,000 milestone at the beginning of the year. So what caused Bitcoin to jump that much? How did Bitcoin reach $10,000? One of the reasons, experts say, is due to institutional money. Investments from anywhere from hedge funds to pension funds to corporate businesses have been pouring into the cryptocurrency market and the fact that Bitcoin is now being supported by so much institutional money is a big reason for its advancement. Accounting firms and banks from around the world are supporting Bitcoin now when they weren’t before and this marks a major shift. Bitcoin is being adopted into the mainstream. Both those who have done research on the market, as well as investors unfamiliar with cryptocurrency, are putting money into Bitcoin right now. There are new streams of people getting involved with Bitcoin every day, and the more people supporting it, the more news about Bitcoin is generated, the more Bitcoin grows. Even at these levels though, only an estimated half-percent of the global population uses digital currency, meaning that there is still more room for Bitcoin to grow if it can keep its market going. Sol Lederer, Blockchain Director at LOOMIA has said of the growing cryptocurrency, “Bitcoin’s future is still uncertain; it faces the same serious technical challenges it has for years and faces stiff competition from newer, more sophisticated Blockchains. But even if it were to crash, it’s apparent that Bitcoin is here to stay. Whether it trades at $10,000, $5,000, or $500, it’s not going away.” Featured Image: twitter"
1," Bitcoin (BTC) is back above the $10,500 mark and climbing the rollercoaster 48 hours it just had.  Source: CoinMarketCap As per CoinMarketCap, BTC is currently selling at $10,795 and is up 13.66 percent in the last 24 hours. As you can see from the chart above, Bitcoin hit a record high of $11,488.60 at 14:09:10 UTC and dropped to a staggering $9,669 at 19:54:13, down a staggering -16 percent in just a matter of hours. There were various reports of exchange issues when buyers/traders flooded the systems when both BTC and Ethereum, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency, hit their record highs almost simultaneously. Coinbase, the largest online exchange had to undergo various updates as their system crashed and users were completely locked out of their account. The next day, however, they underwent full system upgrades to accommodate more users being on their site and are now full systems go. Another exchange, Gemini, claimed they were “undergoing maintenance” mid-day Wednesday and completely shut down their website but got their exchange up and running that night. Bitcoin is no stranger to high volatility, it has dipped over 20 percent in its value already on three different occasions this year. With the news breaking of the upcoming BTC futures to be traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, you can expect definite price fluctuations leading up to this release.

1," Nobel Prize Winner Joseph Stiglitz declared on Bloomberg TV that cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, should be prohibited. The reason? Because Stiglitz believes the market for Bitcoin is driven primarily by its potential to get around certain government organizations.  In Stiglitz’s statement – which appeared to be more of a rant – he added that the Bitcoin market will fluctuate for a while, and then eventually hit a wall, leaving hundreds of investors injured. For these reasons, Stiglitz believes cryptocurrencies should be banned. He also added that Bitcoin does not have a “socially useful function.”  It’s not just cryptocurrency that Dr. Stiglitz is reportedly looking to take down. He might also want to ban the FANG stocks, which stands for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).  Some might be shocked by that, while others might have wanted the same ban to occur. If consumer protection is your goal, then FANG stocks are extremely risky and could be worthy of a ban.  Dr. Stiglitz might be onto something, but until the nature of Bitcoin changes, the digital currency might be near impossible to ban. It seems governments are just going to have to deal with the cryptocurrency.  Featured Image: twitter"
1," One of the world’s largest accounting firms, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), has accepted its first ever bitcoin payment. PwC accepted bitcoin as payment for its advisory services, as it is currently working with multiple startups that deal in bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry. PwC has also started to advise clients about various cryptocurrency related options, such as funds and investments, exchanges, and ICOs. “This decision helps illustrate how we are embracing new technology and incorporating innovative business models across our full range of services,” said PwC Asia-Pacific chairman Raymund Chao. “It is also an indication that bitcoin and other established cryptocurrencies have now developed into more broadly accepted forms of settlement.” PwC is not the first accounting firm to accept bitcoin as payment for its services. Ernst & Young (EY) in Switzerland accepted bitcoin for its auditing and advisory services at the beginning of 2017. EY also set up a Bitcoin ATM among its offices, providing its employees with a digital bitcoin wallet within its in-house EY wallet app. Accepting bitcoin as payment was essential for EY’s strategy of “digitizing itself.” Featured Image: twitter"
1," Turkey has reportedly declared Bitcoin not “compatible” with Islam because the government is unable to have control over it.  Based on a statement from a meeting of the state Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet), lawmakers strongly believe Bitcoin has a “speculative” nature which makes purchasing and selling it an ‘inappropriate’ act for Muslims.  Here’s the translated statement:  “Buying and selling virtual currencies is not compatible with religion at this time because of the fact that their valuation is open to speculation. They can be easily used in illegal activities like money laundering, and they are not under the state’s audit and surveillance.” For those who don’t know, Diyanet put the guidance into action on November 24, which means it was only a couple days before Bitcoin’s latest bull run.  After Turkey’s banning of PayPal, the transcontinental country has since been a target of Bitcoin startups, however, conditions over there have continued to be unstable.  In the statement, Diyanet noted that the “unsuitability” principles also apply to Ethereum.  Featured Image: Depositphotos/© yamabikay"
1," CEO of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Lloyd Blankfein, claims that bitcoin is a “vehicle to perpetrate fraud” and has been outward about his distrust of the cryptocurrency. “Something that moves up and down 20 percent in a day doesn’t feel like a currency, doesn’t feel like a store of value,” said Blankfein. Bitcoin hit its all-time high on Wednesday, reaching $11,441, but skeptics like Blankfein aren’t jumping to get in on the action, perhaps for good reason. Since this record-breaking level, bitcoin has been struggling to maintain the $10,000 threshold it had been working itself towards all week, most recently trading at $9,577 — almost $2,000 off its recently achieved high. Blankfein has no plans to start pursuing bitcoin, personally or professionally. “If it works out — and it gets more established, and it trades more like a store of value, and it doesn’t move up and down 20 percent, and there is liquidity to it — we’ll get to it.” But Blankfein doesn’t see that happening anytime soon. “When do I have to have a bitcoin strategy? Not today,” Blankfein stating, showing his lack of interest in the cryptocurrency. “Bitcoin is not for me. A lot of things that have not been for me in the past 20 years have worked out, but I am not guessing that this will work out,” he concluded. Featured Image: twitter"
1," The Bitcoin Gold wallet repository and download files weres hacked last week, putting users at risk of having funds and personal data stolen. A “Critical Warning” was posted by the Bitcoin Gold’s development team on November 26, stating that anyone who downloaded the official Windows wallet from the Bitcoin Gold website or GitHub repository between November 21-25 will have also received two suspicious files of unknown origin. The assumption is that these files were created to steal user funds or information. Developers are urging those who downloaded the Windows wallet client during this time period to proceed with caution. Some have even suggested fully wiping any machines that downloaded the infected files, in order for users to protect themselves and their funds. “Anyone who downloaded the Windows Wallet file between November 21, 2017, 09:39 UTC, and November 25, 2017, 22:30 UTC, should not use the file in any way. If the file was used, the computer on which it was used should be addressed with extreme caution; the file should be deleted, the machine should be thoroughly checked for malware and viruses (or wiped clean), and any cryptocurrencies with wallets accessible on that machine should be moved to new wallet addresses immediately,” the team wrote. Numbers of those affected by the security breach and how many, if any, have subsequently lost funds have still yet to be determined. The Linux file was not affected by the breach, and the GitHub repository has now been secured to prevent any future breach from occurring. However, users should still verify that the updated wallet download checksum matches the checksum listed on the Bitcoin Gold website. Bitcoin Gold has dropped nearly 25% since the hack was announced, and is currently trading at $305. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Frank-Peters"
1," Guess what? There have been a number of announcements made by Blockchain experts around the world at the ongoing BlockShow Asia conference. In fact, one of these announcements is from Gibraltar, which is one of the smallest dependent territories in the world.  So, what’s the big news? Well, the Gibraltar Stock Exchange is now offering a brand new exchange: the Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange. Essentially, this is a new way for investors to join the steadily increasing cryptocurrency market. The best part is that Gibraltar already has the approval of European regulators, so it’s in the position to create quite the platform.  The aim is that is the platform will allow conventional investors to feel more comfortable. According to Gibraltar, the plan is to develop a safe place for investors who are too terrified of the idea of entering the unchartered waters of the digital currency market.  “Centered on the solid foundations of Gibraltar’s emerging regulations, the GBX seeks to become the world’s first nationally regulated digital asset marketplace and ecosystem, building towards a new era of certainty and stability for the world of Blockchain technology. Members of the Fintech community will find their home for a secure, supported and vibrant crypto community.” As mentioned, BlockShow Asia is ongoing, so it is important that you keep your eyes peeled so that you don’t miss any more announcements!

Source: CoinMarketCap At press time, BTC is at $9,431.85 – which is way below its record of $11,517.40 reached yesterday morning at 14:14:11 UTC. The BTC-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate has decreased by over 13 percent in just 24 hours. Week-on-week, BTC is up 15 percent, while on a monthly basis, it is up 56 percent.  Source: CoinMarketCap There have been numerous reports that the largest exchanges, CoinBase and Gemini, experienced service outages and technical issues just after BTC hit its record highs yesterday. It is said that the massive spikes in traffic had caused these problems and Coinbase, had become unavailable to a number of its users. Exchange outages in the past have contributed to major ‘sell-offs’ in cryptocurrencies. As per the chart above, the top 11 cryptocurrencies suffered greatly yesterday from the exchange issues and bitcoin’s rapid drop.   The cryptocurrency is extremely volatile and on three other separate occasions in 2017, BTC’s value dropped more than 20 percent.

1," Sir Jon Cunliffe has officially declared that digital currency Bitcoin is no threat to the economy, nor is it a threat to financial organizations. This, of course, differs from what Nobel Prize Winner Joseph Stiglitz had to say about the leading cryptocurrency.  The Bank of England Deputy Governor gave an interview to BBC Radio 5 Live in which he stated that Bitcoin was far too small to show any signs of a threat to the global economy. Cunliffe noted that it is important for investors to do a thorough analysis of the currency and the reasons behind its success in order to avoid risks.  “This is not at a size where it’s a macroeconomic risk to the global economy, but when prices are moving like that, my view would be investors need to do their homework. This is not a currency in the accepted sense. There’s no central bank that stands behind it. For me, it’s much more like a commodity.” Over the course of the past few weeks, Bitcoin has seen a number of novel price hikes. To no surprise, this led various analysts and experts to debate on whether or not the currency will continue to grow in the future.  That said, well-known billionaire Mike Novogratz has estimated that Bitcoin will hit the mark of $40,000 in the next 13 months.  Featured Image: twitter"
1," Big news: a Ukrainian shipper is negotiating its first-ever Bitcoin transaction. This is significant news as it means the global shipping sector has the potential to reap substantial benefits in using Bitcoin.  Varamar Ltd., which is an Odessa-based shipping company, will be one of the first shipping operators to take payments in Bitcoin, a digital currency. Bloomberg has reported that the southern Ukrainian shipper is in talks with a client for its first Bitcoin transaction. If all goes as planned, Varamar Ltd. will accept the cryptocurrency in future transactions.  As mentioned, this is significant news as the shipping industry tends to be known for not adopting new technologies. But, Bitcoin and Bitcoin transactions seems to be solving a crucial process that has affected the modern shipping sector for years.  Here’s what Varamar founder Alexander Varvarenko had to say about the matter: “Paperwork for transactions is a complicated issue with banks, and Bitcoin payments will help solve that by being faster.” Now that Varamar has made the first move, other industry shippers are starting to tune in. There are reports that Russian chartering broker Interchart Shipping Inc. is working to create payment rails through the currency.  Featured Image: twitter"

The (DASH/USD) exchange rate has increased by over 17 percent in just 24 hours. On a monthly basis DASH is up 159 percent and for the year it is up a staggering 8091.86 percent.  Source: CoinMarketCap Formerly known as ‘dark coin’ and ‘XCoin’, released back in 2014 the altcoin has been getting the most support lately in Korea, trading with their currency the Won. DASH has partnered with KuvaCash and is becoming one of the very first crypto assets to be used in the case of hyperinflation, which has been serving as a store of value, in the country of Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe has been plagued with years of devastating hyperinflation and just recently the citizens forced the resignation of their long-time president Robert Mugabe, further adding to the financial uncertainty of the country. This partnership has claimed to have found a reasonable solution for Zimbabwe to provide some stability and aid in their collapsing economy.   CEO Sheffield Clark of Coinsource made a statement about the partnership stating:  “Dash’s entrance in Africa will significantly improve the lives of thousands of people in Zimbabwe, who will enjoy access to a better form of currency, outside the failing fiat, failing USD-pegged bonds, and dirty dollar bills. From 1980 to 2017, under the rule of President Mugabe, Zimbabweans became an average of 15% poorer – it’s humbling to know that one of our industry peers has the ability to turn that around, and affect so many people in such a positive way.” As this partnership advances and the other major cryptocurrencies continue to rise, DASH’s price should continue its bullish momentum.

Lately, it has shown its true strength as it continues to break its own records on a daily basis. With the upcoming Chicago Mercantile Exchange Bitcoin futures on the horizon, prices should continue to move upward in anticipation.  With Bitcoin doing so well in the last few weeks, other cryptocurrencies have also hit new record highs. Ether, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market value, is up 61 percent for the month and Dash, the fifth largest, is up 21 percent in just 24 hours.  There has been much talk of a ‘bubble’ swirling around the cryptocurrency market this year, with the market now being compared to the dot.com bubble that occurred in 2001. While it is still unclear if these speculations are true, it is always wise to only invest as much as you are able to lose. Featured Image: twitter"

1," Earlier in the week, rumors were flying that the identity of Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, one of the hottest mysteries of the crypto world, had been discovered at last and that identity was none other than Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Days later, these rumors were crushed, by Musk himself.  source: twitter Musk took to Twitter, breaking the news to hopefuls everywhere that he was not the infamous Satoshi Nakamoto, as had been claimed by a former SpaceX employee. Musk’s response to the news that he stood behind the most sought-after identity in the cryptocurrency realm? “Not true. A friend sent me part of a BTC a few years, but I don’t know where it is.” The search, therefore, continues for the true identity behind Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto. What big name will be linked to him next? Featured Image: depositphotos/ william87"
1," More and more people are looking to ‘buy bitcoin with credit card’, according to Google Trends, which has captured this phrase being typed into the search engine at increasing numbers ever since the cryptocurrency hit record highs. Bitcoin has increased almost 10-fold in this past year alone, and this past weekend the cryptocurrency breached the $9,000 barrier. Already, it is nearing the $10,000 mark, so it’s hardly surprising that so many people would be curious about the topic and interested in getting into the market through the use of a credit card. There are those who remain wary of the cryptocurrency surge, though. Ken Griffin, Citadel hedge manager, told CNBC that “these bubbles tend to end in tears,” while Mitchell Goldberg, head of ClientFirst Strategy, says “we’ve entered the final and stupidest part of the bull market.” Regardless of these warnings, the combined crypto market has reached a record $309.9 billion. To give that some perspective, Visa is worth $254 billion, and the Bank of America sits at $277.3 billion. Bitcoin isn’t without its enthusiasts. Billionaire investor and hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz has said “Bitcoin could be at $40,000 at the end of 2018. It easily could.” Analyst and founder of Standpoint Research Ronnie Moas believes a more conservative route is in Bitcoin’s future, reaching $14,000 in 2018. With so many differing opinions on the matter, it’ll be interesting to see where Bitcoin goes from here. Will it continue to see an increase in value, or are the doubters right about a market crash being Bitcoin’s more realistic future? Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Tzido"
1," According to a recent analysis that looked primarily at supply and demand, the Bitcoin bull run will come to an end only because of the plethora of supply, and not because of a lack of buyers, which is what everyone forecasted. Essentially, the supply will come via new ways of trading Bitcoin, a digital currency, and from Bitcoin hard forks, which is a term used to describe a radical change to the protocol that makes previously invalid transactions/blocks valid. Back in the late 1990’s, there was a dot-com bubble, which is where this analysis comes from. If you were a company that had .com in your name during the dot-com bubble, then you would receive a major market increase. That said, the dot-com bubble came to an end after a large number of new .com initial public offerings took over the market. There was a time when the market absorbed them, but eventually, the market saw the problem and corrected it, which pulled the rug out from the majority of those businesses and like Darwin said, only the strongest survived. Perhaps one of the most important aspects of Bitcoin is its limited supply. If you were to ask anyone familiar with Bitcoin, they will tell you that only 21 mln Bitcoin will ever exist. So, the question that remains is: with such limited supply, how could an oversupply of the cryptocurrency occur? This is not a simple question to answer as it varies depending on how you look at it. To begin, Bitcoin hard forks are now developing new derivatives from the original currency. Take Bitcoin Cash for instance: this hard fork has caused a brand new Bitcoin with a market capitalization of $26 billion. According to the analysis, “…as the river of ways to invest in cryptocurrencies widens, the flood that has lifted the price of the Bitcoin will surely recede, and, as always, much faster than people expect.” Featured Image: twitter"
1," Bitcoin has been making major worldwide news headlines for the past week, smashing its own records and now has broken over the $10,000 mark.  The biggest unsolved mystery with the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value is who exactly Satoshi Nakamoto is. The white paper launched by the alias name was back in November of 2008, after the large housing/stock market crash.  No actual person or group since then has come forward and claimed the rights to inventing this idea and technology.  Recently, a software engineering intern at SpaceX by the name of Sahil Gupta wrote a post on the website, with the suspicion that Nakamoto is Tesla’s CEO and SpaceX’s founder, the one and only Elon Musk.  What kind of evidence does this intern have for this claim? Nothing definite but his logic is relatively fair. The original white paper written back in 2008 was by someone with “a deep understanding of economics and cryptography,” which Gupta knows that Musk has. He claims that Musk is an expert of the coding language C++, and that is the code Bitcoin was written in. Gupta discusses Mr. Musks’s drive towards his self-taught polymath that he built his rockets on for SpaceX and could have invented Bitcoin. Gupta goes on explain why Musk would have created Bitcoin back in 2008, saying: “It was 2008 (Great Recession), and he may have been motivated to solve the lack of trust in banks by creating a currency that doesn’t need them.” Back in 2014, a tweet was uncovered from Musk was in which he admits coyly that he is Satoshi.  Source: Twitter  He ends the article by personally thanking Musk, “Elon – if you are Satoshi, thank you. If not, well, thanks for the Tesla Roadster.” What are your thoughts? Did the millionaire aerospace tech mogul create Bitcoin? Featured Image: twitter"
1," For the past few days, Bitcoin (BTC) has been smashing its own records.  Source: CoinMarketCap As per CoinMarketCap, the Bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate catapulted above the $10,000 mark at 11:19:11 UTC. At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $10,001.50 and is up already 3.87 percent on the day. Its record high occurred at 12:04:14 UTC when it traded at $10,113.70. BTC’s price is up 75.12 percent for the month.  Source: CoinMarketCap Just over two weeks ago, Bitcoin was in major trouble as it’s major upgrade SegWit2x was cancelled abruptly and the system’s “difficulty” protocol slowed the system down almost to a halt.  Miners jumped ship and began mining on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain as it became the more profitable option, causing things to flip nearly overnight. What saved the original blockchain, however, was the fact that Bitcoin Cash’s difficulty protocol caught up with it and the miners began mining the original blockchain once more. At its peak on November 12th, BCH reached a high of $2306.15 but now, at press time is trading at $1571.58. Despite its past issues with Bitcoin, it still reigns supreme when it comes to all the digital currencies on the market, with its market cap three times the size of the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum. It has seen its fair share of difficulties over the years but still has managed to rebound quickly and break record-after-record. Back in the middle of October, a Wall Street strategist by the name of Tom Lee predicted that Bitcoin would reach $25,000 by 2020. At the time, everyone thought he was crazy but now, it doesn’t seem that far off. As the Bitcoin’s developing team continues to work on SegWit2x, the block size limitations still remain. As BTC’s price continues its climb, we will see how much the block sizes actually affect transactions and what its dev team will do next. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© nevarpp"
1," Bitcoin Gold (BTG) may not be living up to its hype, despite its recent successes. Bitcoin Gold was meant to make mining more democratic and has jumped to being the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It reached a high of $413.74 on November 24, doubling its prices since November 19. However, despite these notable jumps, not everyone feels it is worth it. Social media comments show that some investors think BTG is overvalued and that there are few apparent use cases. This makes the $400 gains speculative unless traders are otherwise anticipating use cases to appear in the future. This looks like it may not be the case though, as price analysis indicates a correction is what the future actually holds. BTG may end up dropping to $250 levels in the short-run. But it could also go up to $480 levels. The next 12 hours will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin gold is worth it or not. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Merlinus74"
1," As Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new record high for the third week in a row, there have been some speculations in the financial industry that institutional investors might seek a safe haven in digital currency in the future. Max Keiser ‘s prediction last week of BTC eventually reaching $100,000 doesn’t seem so far off now, as its price begins to climb and top financial heads, have begun to jump on board.  Mikhail Mashchenko, EToro analyst, spoke to RT and states, “financial institutions could look to Bitcoin if major financial crash hits global markets.” He added: “The demand for Bitcoin is growing as the crypto market has become less volatile, and an increasing number of professional investors see it as insurance.” The stock market is currently in its second-longest bullish streak in history, currently at 104 months, Wall Street is gearing up for its inevitable shift. The longest streak in history was after the year 2000 where it made a 113-month run. If Maschenko’s predictions are correct, Bitcoin will have some sort of play in all of it. In the financial sector, it seems that there have been competing opinions on the cryptocurrency space. Just last week, JPMorgan announced that they will be offering Bitcoin futures set to launch in two weeks on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Many of the major European banks have been on opposite spectrums when it comes to supporting or bashing Bitcoin. What’s most exciting about this the current JPMorgan news is their CEO, Jamie Dimon, has been consistently in the news for slamming Bitcoin calling it a “fraud” but now his company, will be participating in the upcoming futures trades. When and if the stream of institutional investors start dipping their toes and invest large amounts of capital into cryptocurrencies a few of those predictions could be made true. Tom Lee, a 25 year Wall Street strategist, predicted back in August that Bitcoin would reach $6,000 by mid-2018 and in five years would reach $25,000. When a lot of regulations hit at the beginning of September, he held his ground on predictions despite being widely criticized. Lee’s prediction of $6,000 back in August now seems extremely conservative, whereas Mashchenko’s belief now is that Bitcoin will reach $10,000 by the end of 2017. “We could see a Bitcoin at $10,000 in a month or so. However, such a surge will be based on emotions, not on fundamental factors. So, further growth of the cryptocurrency will require something more than euphoria.”  Source: CoinMarketCap His predictions do not seem far off, seeing as Bitcoin has surged in price over $1,000 in just a couple of days. At press-time Bitcoin is trading at $9714.02 and up 3.78% for the day. At the rate of its current growth, Mashchenko prediction could happen within the current week.

1," Bitcoin’s “mining” network uses more electricity in a year than the whole of Ireland, according to statistics released as the currency broke $9,000 for the first time.  According to Digiconomist, the estimated power use of the Bitcoin network, which is responsible for verifying transactions made with cryptocurrency, is 30.14TWh a year, which exceeds that of 19 other European countries. At a continuous power drain of 3.4GW, it means the network consumes five times more electricity than is produced by the largest wind farm in Europe, the London Array in the outer Thames Estuary, at 630MW.  As such, at those levels of electricity consumption, each individual Bitcoin transaction uses almost 300KWh of electricity- enough to boil around 36,000 kettles full of water. Although power consumption of other payment networks is harder to isolate, one of Visa’s two US data centers reportedly runs on about 2% of the power required by Bitcoin. Between them, those two datacenters conduct around 200m transactions a day; the Bitcoin network handless fewer than 350,000.  As the price of Bitcoin surges, so does the value of the reward, entailing that more miners put more computers to the task of running the network. But since the price of Bitcoin doesn’t necessarily rise in step with the number of transactions, that disconnect means the currency uses a significant amount of power per transaction in period of high prices.

1," Bitcoin will be showcased on another TV show this upcoming Thursday, the 30th on the American Network CBS. The Big Bang Theory (BBT), will base its entire episode around Bitcoin as its cast will find a laptop full of the cryptocurrency. The BBT is currently airing its 11th season and is one of America’s most popular sitcoms. The show is centered around a group of friends who lean more on the ‘geeky’ genius side that reside in Pasadena, California. CBS’s top-rated show is infused with comic book collections, video games, and endless scientific humor.  Thursday’s show will be called “The Bitcoin Entanglement” and will expose millions of viewers to the world of cryptocurrency. For those familiar with the show, the BBT cast will find a laptop belonging to an ex of Penny’s that hold Bitcoins. The group is surprised that a single Bitcoin costs $5,000 USD and remembers that they “mined” some a while back. They all join in on a conversation as to how they would spend their Bitcoin money but decide to remove the show’s main character, Sheldon, from the investment split. Sheldon decides to mess with the gang, who discovers that the Bitcoin wallet is empty but Sheldon’s the only one that knows where these funds are stored. Bitcoin investors should be pretty enthusiastic to see their beloved cryptocurrency on a popular television sitcom showcasing the cryptocurrency, mining process and its wallets. BBT holds a current 8.3 rating on IMDb and should have close to 12.6 million viewers this coming Thursday.  Lately, Bitcoin has been debuted on other popular tv shows such as ABC’s Grey’s Anatomy. Airing two Thursday’s ago, a hacker held the tv’s show’s hospital system ransom, in exchange for 5,000 Bitcoin, which would be worth $200,000,000, as per the show. Bitcoin has also been previously mentioned on other popular TV shows such as Mr. Robot, The Simpsons, Jeopardy and the Good Wife. The BBT’s show was filmed a while back when Bitcoin’s price was around $5,000 per BTC but now it’s pushing almost double, at around $9,700 and has a $160B market cap. This week’s episode is certain to bring more users to inquire about the cryptocurrency market. Featured Image: twitter"
1," As of November 27th, bitcoin price achieved a new all-time high for the second time in the past 24 hours, surpassing $9,771 and moving closer towards $10,000.  Yesterday, on November 26th, CNN noted that the price of Bitcoin saw a new all-time high at $9,060. Within 24 hours, the price of Bitcoin increased from $9,060 to $9,771, by nearly $700 overnight.  Since then, bitcoin price has stabilized in the $9,550 region. Short-term indicators such as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) reveal strong short-term momentum for Bitcoin.  Billionaire investor Mike Novogratz predict that Bitcoin price will surpass $10,000 this year.  The CME Group Bitcoin futures exchange launch is imposing a similar impact that the Bitcoin ETF had on the global Bitcoin market in March. The difference between the March Bitcoin ETF anticipation and the CME Group Bitcoin futures exchange hype is that the latter is guaranteed, given that another Bitcoin options exchange in LedgerX has already been approved and regulated by the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Further, the adoption of Bitcoin as a store of value and as a payment method is increasing at a rapid rate. In countries like Japan, major retailers and businesses like Bic Camera, Peach Airline, and Capsule hotels have already started to accept Bitcoin through strategic partnerships with cryptocurrency exchanges.  If Bitcoin’s current preference as a payment method continues to surge throughout 2018, its price will very likely reach the $10,000 mark. Featured Image: twitter"
1," Iran has been allowing Bitcoin into the country, but not without managing it. Here’s a look at what sort of combative efforts they are making towards the cryptocurrency, and some reasons behind it. The High Council of Cyberspace (HCC) is the authority deciding on the entry of Bitcoin into the country, and so far, they have welcomed it, so long as it is controlled. HCC secretary Abolhassan Firouzabadi explains further, “We [at the HCC] welcome Bitcoin, but we must have regulations for Bitcoin and any other digital currency […] Our view regarding Bitcoin is positive, but it does not mean that we will not require regulations in this regard because following the rules is a must.” Bitcoin, in Iran, has been used as payment methods in both financial services and startup companies. Firouzabadi stated, “many in Iran are dealing with Bitcoin, be it purchasing, selling or mining it, and even dealing with it in exchange shops, creating content and establishing startups.” Due to this, the HCC, as well as the Central Bank of Iran, have begun to study cryptocurrencies to better understand the benefits and drawbacks of them. One of the main reasons behind Iran’s welcoming stance on cryptocurrency is a result from when, in 2012, Iranian banks were removed from the SWIFT payments network, subsequently removing Iran from the global banking system. This lasted four years. It’s possible that Iran is trying to get ahead of the curve on cryptocurrencies, and by regulating them, they hold better control. Featured Image: depositphotos/gustavofrazao"
1," Square’s Cash app, that features payments between friends, recently granted users the use of Bitcoin. The company’s CFO and operations lead Sarah Friar indicated that this move is about Square’s own innovation and not Bitcoin’s validation.  Square recently beat out Venmo as one of the most downloaded financial apps because of its usability. Its shares jumped over 4% when the news broke, as it signals Bitcoin trading for mainstream traders. The app has its limitations, however. Currently, users can not complete transactions in the cryptocurrency. Credit Suisse analysts also pointed out that Square is well positioned to allow cryptocurrency transactions at the point of sale. According to CNBC, the institutions recently elaborated its comments, adding that Square can add millions in annual revenue by supporting the cryptocurrency.  Credit Suisse estimates that Square can add 10 million bitcoin buyers over two years, which would drive its revenue up by $30 million. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© merznatalia"
1," In 2009, a man by the name of James Howells mined 7,500 Bitcoins with his laptop. He later had to take his laptop apart, and the hard drive containing the Bitcoins ended up in a drawer, which, three years later, ended up being cleared out and the hard drive was tossed. The 7,500 Bitcoins have gone from being worth $600,000 to $5 million to its current worth today of $72 million. The hard drive and its rich contents have long been lost in a Newport landfill, and there has been much speculation recently about whether or not it will ever be retrieved and what this retrieval could mean for Howells. The funds to dig through the landfill were too much for Howells, and he has since stated, “I’m at the point where it’s either laugh about it or cry about it. Why aren’t I out there with a shovel now? I think I’m just resigned to never being able to find it.” Other speculators looking to get their hands on the valuable hard drive won’t find the task so easy. Beyond the landfill being off-limits to the public, a Newport council spokesperson has said that if the hard drive were to be found, it would be returned to Howells as the rightful owner. If the hard drive does still exist and hasn’t deteriorated away within the landfill, then it will be the most expensive and sought-after piece of junk anyone will have ever seen.

1," With the success of Bitcoin comes the success of GPU manufacturing firms, Nvidia and AMD. Specifically, Bitcoin has risen $2,000 in the past few weeks and has indirectly given a 2% increase to companies like Nvidia and AMD. Why would a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin have any sort of effect on GPU manufacturers? Well, that has a lot to do with the form of the cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is online money, which means that to be involved with it in any way, you need to have access to a computer. From amateurs looking to get into mining to the more serious investor involved with cryptocurrency-related businesses, a graphics card is going to be bought in order to process it all. That means the more people getting into Bitcoin, the more graphics cards are required for them, the more money companies like Nvidia and AMD make. The rising stock in GPU manufacturers also comes from the recently announced upgrade to Ethereum’s Blockchain. The upgrade requires workers, who require GPUs, increasing demand for them further.  So long as cryptocurrency remains online, which is, at its core, the whole point of cryptocurrency, then GPUs will be needed to process everything cryptocurrency-related, and so, companies producing these valuable items will flourish.

0," Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has rallied back above the $1500 mark today as its lead developer pronounced Bitcoin (BTC) “dead.” Tuesday on Twitter, Deadal Nix, tweeted while Bitcoin started its bullish climb, the August hard fork that created BCH meant that Bitcoin already no longer existed. Deadal Nix’s tweet said, “Bitcoin is dead. It was split in two. There is Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin Core/Legacy. Deal with it.” Bitcoin’s core community responded immediately, Charlie Shrem was the first noting that “Nix” publicly calls himself “shitlord.”  Source: https://twitter.com/CharlieShrem/status/933533015292211200 The tension begins to rise as BCH is on a current track of doubling its low Nov 17th value of $975. At Press Time Bitcoin Cash is trading at $1548, up 17% in just 24 hours.  BTX is currently trading just under $8,200 breaking its own records mere days ago. Two weeks ago when BCH made its bullish climb they flipped and Bitcoin dropped substantially. Bitcoin ended up rebounding within a few days and crushed its own record. Featured Image: twitter"
0," While most cryptocurrency prices continue to ascend, Bitcoin’s price implies that it still reigns supreme, when it comes to digital currency.  Russia Today’s host, Max Keiser, just projected that one day Bitcoin will reach around $100,000. Bitcoin’s price hit a record high over the weekend, pushing past the $8,000 mark and defeated all cryptocurrency skepticism when it’s scheduled upgrade SegWit2x didn’t occur. On Monday and Tuesday of this week, Bitcoin was pushing the $8,400 mark breaking previous record highs.   Keiser’s belief is centered around Bitcoin’s ability to withstand multiple changes, proving it to be the most “dependable” and sturdy of the cryptocurrencies.  He said: “Bitcoin will dominate and lead crypto going forward. Hundreds of obituaries have been written about Bitcoin and none of them have come true and none will. Fact is, Bitcoin is a gift from God to help humanity sort out the mess it has made with its money.” While this new declaration from Keiser sheds a positive light on Bitcoin, it doesn’t change the fact that the network still needs room to grow. While the upgrade was postponed, for now, the issues it aimed at solving are not going away. The increasing amount of transaction on the original blockchain is putting a major strain on the network’s capacity and the accumulation of backlogged transactions makes Bitcoin’s blockchain burdensome while being used as a payment method.  Keiser believes that Bitcoin’s focus should be on its role as “digital gold” and leave the payments to other blockchains. He said:  “Dash is emerging as the crypto payment rail while Bitcoin asserts itself as Gold 2.0. I suggest those frustrated by the Bitcoin scaling debate to embrace Dash for payments and leave Bitcoin Core alone to continue working on Gold 2.0.” Many major investors appear to be responding positively to the story of Bitcoin being digital gold. There has been talk circulating about the potential of institutional investors bursting into the market with billion-dollar investments. It seems like the news about the upcoming launch of CME’s Bitcoin futures seems to be affecting the market positively.  Keiser’s forecast of Bitcoin doesn’t seem so far off now given the popularity it’s been getting in the mainstream market. He even went so much as to compare Bitcoin to Apple: “I remember when I bought Apple stock in the late 1990’s when it was valued for less than $100 million, Michael Dell publicly said that Apple should shut its doors and stop the embarrassment of being in business. Twenty years later, it’s approaching a $1 trillion market cap, and nobody talks about Michael Dell anymore.” Featured Image: twitter"
1," Tobam, a French asset management firm which has $9 billion in assets, announced today that it will launch Europe’s first Bitcoin centered mutual fund. Their alternative investment fund illustrates the latest bid to attract investors to Bitcoin. The Financial Times reports that their fund has been approved by France’s financial regulator the Autorité des Marchés Financiers, was audited by PwC, and Caceis is going to be holding custody of the cryptocurrencies that are tied to the funds. Tobam’s President, Yves Choueifaty, said in a statement: “This first move in the world of cryptocurrencies showcases our dedication to remaining ahead of the curve and to provide our clients with innovative products in the context of efficient (i.e. unpredictable) markets.” The president also told the publication that they have “found some investors to launch the fund” and they have has “a lot of interest” when it comes to Bitcoin.  It is unsurprising that some investors want some exposure to the digital currency market, as Bitcoin has surged 5,000% against the dollar. There was now 55 dedicated cryptocurrency hedge funds and the CME Group is set to launch their bitcoin futures contracts next month.  It still is unknown if Tobam’s products will strike even more interest but with the most recent news and push towards the cryptocurrency it definitely seems that there will be.

0," Over the weekend, a hacker hit Sacramento Regional Transit (SacRT) and deleted around 30 million files. These erased files contained the important programs the city uses for dispatching and planning the bus routes, along with their bus driver assignments.  It started on Saturday when the hackers took over the website and completely defaced it with a note stating, “I’m sorry to modify the home page, i’m good hacker, I just want to help you fix these vulnerabilities. This is one of the loopholes, modify the homepage.”  After the company was notified by residents, out of safety they took the entire website down, along with the credit card processing system.  The hacker then demanded a single Bitcoin, worth now over $8,000 USD, in order to stop the attacks and allow the IT team at SacRT to get the system back and running. Their exact note stated, “Hello, I will always attack your website, we are hackers. We can do everything. Pay us now to stop attacking.” They have not paid the ransom and are working diligently to get the system up and running. A representative told FoxNews that they back up their files “every day” and are restoring it via backup. The hack and ransom are extremely odd due to the size. By comparison, other hacks this year ranged from $250,000 to over $80 million. HBO and Equifax are the most notable companies that were hacked on a larger scale. It is still unclear as to why the ransom was so small, in comparison to the disruption it caused to the city of Sacramento.  Featured Image: twitter"
0," Tether, a startup that offers dollar-backed cryptocurrency, announced on Monday that its system was hacked, with more than $30 million US dollars worth of Bitcoin stolen. In the removed post from the company’s website, Tether blamed a “malicious action by an external attacker” for the heist. Tether, which was originally called Realcoin, is a platform that serves as a proxy for USD that can be sent between various exchanges. The company said it is moving quickly to make sure the exchanged money does not trade and reintroduced into the digital currency economy.   Tether wrote a statement saying: “$30,950,010 USDT was removed from the Tether Treasury wallet on Nov. 19, 2017 and sent to an unauthorized bitcoin address. As Tether is the issuer of the USDT managed asset, we will not redeem any of the stolen tokens, and we are in the process of attempting token recovery to prevent them from entering the broader ecosystem.” They are planning on releasing a new version of the software client Omni Core, which Tether runs on top of, to tie up the stolen currency. If all the nodes in the bitcoin network accept the new software, it would completely blacklist the stolen address and would trigger an emergency hard fork to hold the funds. Employees at Omni Core are hoping to release their new software in the days ahead, in hopes of retrieving the stolen Bitcoin.  Cryptocurrency investors took to twitter to voice their speculations on the entire situation, as it related to Tether and their level of control over their own software and the blockchain. In one particular thread, an investor said, “The level of control they exert over this blockchain is unusual, to the point where it could trigger regulation.” Following the announcement of the hack, other exchanges that grant order-book trading on Tether, like Huobi and OKCoin, immediately took steps and froze their trading.

1," With the Chicago Mercantile Exchange set to launch its Bitcoin futures in three weeks, Bitcoin’s price has seen records highs, something that one Capital Management founder has taken note of. Despite the rocky week, Bitcoin had last week with the cancellation of its upgrade, SegWit2x, it seems the cryptocurrency has made a comeback and then some. At press time, Bitcoin has reached a record-high of trading at $8332.84. With the slump in the price reaching almost $6,500 last week, it left a lot of investors or those thinking of investing on the fence. However, the founder and chief investment officer of Morgan Creek Capital Management, which carries $3.7 billion in assets under its management, is still confident in the cryptocurrency and has predicted it will reach $400,000 in the long-run. Mark Yusko has been a senior investor for almost 25 years and invested in Bitcoin back in 2011. He regrets taking the “picks and shovels” method of investing and wishes he would’ve invested more. The Capital Management founder acknowledges why most financial higher-ups have such a negative reaction when it comes to bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies and believes the physical financial institution will one day become obsolete. Yukso states, “It is extremely natural to expect banks to be dismissive and skeptical because this is a disruptive technology. This will change the supply and demand equation for banking. It is that big. I’m not surprised at all that bankers, financiers and Saudi Princes are coming out against it. This is a truly disruptive technology.” He also added further to his statement of banks becoming obsolete, saying, “If you think about it why do we need a giant building to have a bank? We don’t.” In his eyes, money is digitized now. Yukso explains, “One of my greatest fears or nightmares is that I may wake up one morning and the bank says I have no money. How would I prove that I do? I don’t have physical records anymore, I don’t have a statement that says you have X dollars. So I think Bitcoin and blockchain and Ethereum too – are exciting new technologies.” The hedge fund manager compared the blockchain and bitcoin, to the internet thirty years ago. Noting that it has the complete capacity to “change everything” and that internet of money is real and just as crucial as the internet was in the 90s. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© nikolodion"
1," In a group of reports on Monday, the Russian Minister of Communications and Mass Media Nikolai Nikiforov, made a statement that it is highly unlikely that Russia will ever legalize Bitcoin.  Nikiforov prompted that Bitcoin would remain completely outside of legality but the technology it’s founded upon, the blockchain, is “entirely possible.”  He said, “Bitcoin is a foreign project for using blockchain technology, the Russian law will never consider Bitcoin as a legal entity in the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation. However, I think that it is quite possible to use blockchain technology and the use of various digital tokens.”  The minister’s comments add even more to the confusion of Russian lawmakers stance on cryptocurrency. Many of their senior figures in the past have given off many different conflicting notions as to how Russia will act on this new cryptocurrency sensation. Early in October of this year, it was reported that the Russian ministry had submitted a document to the government enclosed with details of cryptocurrency adoption.  At that time, Nikiforov said, “We have submitted a draft decree regulating the legal adoption of cryptocurrency. That is why I think we should go ahead from the technological viewpoint, providing such instruments. It is hardly possible to get anything via restrictions amid digital economic development.”  Ultimately, the minister states the final decision is in the hands of the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Russia. However, some feel an outright ban of cryptocurrency across Russia is most likely inevitable. Featured Image: twitter"
1," Still pending regulatory approval, CME has just announced on their website their plans of launching Bitcoin futures on December 10th and trading set to begin on December 11th.  The world’s largest options exchange first announced its plans of offering the futures opportunity, at the end of October. At that time, CME’s Chairman and CEO, Terry Duffy, stated: “Given increasing client interest in the evolving cryptocurrency markets, we have decided to introduce a bitcoin futures contract — As the world’s largest regulated FX marketplace, CME Group is the natural home for this new vehicle that will provide investors with transparency, price discovery and risk transfer capabilities.” CME has already released its Bitcoin future market specs on its website and is gearing up for the approval of the launch. The futures will be listed on Clearport, CME, and CME’s Globex central standard time, with set limits on 1,000 contracts.  Source: http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_contract_specifications.html Each contract will be based on the price of BTC per USD and each one will have a unit of five index points, which constitutes 5 BTC. As shown in the graph above, the minimum price fluctuations are set at a total of $25 each and the monthly contracts are listed for the nearest 2 months in the March quarterly cycle.  Bitcoin enthusiasts and some speculators assume these futures will bring about less volatility in the Bitcoin spot markets. The company’s contracts will be issued for $25 USD but according to further information provided on CME’s website, will not swing more than 20 percent on the previous settlement price.  Unfortunately, with so much unknown and this being the first cryptocurrency trading on a grand scale, this “taming” is a theoretical concept.  The Bitcoin community and its investors seem excited for the weeks to come, as it could be monumental for the digital currency. Featured Image: twitter"
1," On November 15th, Square Inc announced they would begin testing the support of Bitcoin through its Cash payments app. According to Paul Condra of Credit Suisse, Square can add tens of millions to its revenue with their Bitcoin exploration. In a note to his clients Monday, he stated: “While we are positive on Square’s strategy, to the extent it confers legitimacy on Bitcoin and prompts adoption by other providers (i.e., PayPal) the biggest beneficiary may be the crypto-asset industry. We estimate that if Square can accumulate 10m bitcoin buyers over two years (tracking Coinbase’s growth), this could drive an incremental $30m in revenue” That figure stems from the belief that Square will charge a fee of 1.5 percent each transaction and on average, Condra estimates a customer would spend around $200 annually on bitcoin purchases. The Credit Suisse analyst echoed his neutral rating and increased his price target from $37 to $31. Following this report, Square’s shares closed at just under a 3 percent increase.

0," According to various news sources, the first atomic Bitcoin Litecoin swap on a Lightning network testnet has been deemed a success.  Why is this so important, you ask? The swap is monumental due to it being ‘off-chain’ which means the ownership of the coins switched hands but there was no recording of it on either blockchain.  These swaps are a form of a smart contract and allow a frictionless decentralized exchange of cryptocurrency between two compatible networks. This could be deemed as a solution for decentralized exchanges and could create “families” of coins that would allow different functionalities.  Charlie Lee, Litecoin’s founder, states: “Previous atomic swaps that I have done were on-chain, and had the on-chain limitations of slow [transactions] and high transaction fees. Off-chain atomic swaps are significantly better. They are instant, [have] low fees, and better protect one’s privacy.” This method would allow users to pass different cryptocurrencies to other people without having to wait for on-chain confirmations and would have substantially lower fees. This could deem as a simple solution for scalability for bitcoin, as well as produce much faster transactions.  Another benefit to these particular transactions is they are completely and fully anonymous, due to leaving no trace on either chain. They are entirely complete transactions but untraceable.

The original coin has seen a remarkable “comeback” from its record lows just a week ago, near the $5,600 mark. Since its lows on Sunday, it has rebounded 30 percent. According to CoinMarketCap, the coin’s market cap, or the total value of the digital coins that are currently in circulation, went from $92 billion to just at $133.5 billion.  Source: CoinMarketCap.com   The crypto’s crazy weekend was the result of a cancellation announcement made on the morning of the 8th, in regards to the network upgrade, SegWit2x, that was set to launch November 16th. This upgrade was aimed at improving the transaction speed on the blockchain, that has slowed down a substantial amount over the years. If the upgrade took place, it would have been by way of a “hard fork” which would have resulted in miners mining the old blockchain resulting in a new bitcoin spin-off formed. The coin has already had two hard forks, earlier this year that was the result of the creation of Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold. Cash made headways this weekend towards their push to become the reigning cryptocurrency when miners started dumping Bitcoin’s blockchain and started mining Bitcoin Cash. The miners’ incentive to do this was the result of the difficulty protocol set on the blockchain network that made Bitcoin less profitable to mine and its off-shoot profitable. Eventually, Bitcoin Cash’s difficulty protocol ended up getting in the way when miners started flooding the system and ended up severely slowing down mining, which resulted in miners switching back to the original blockchain. The investor community has been slowly warming up to the idea of moving their money out of bonds and equities and into bitcoin. Projected for mid-December, the CME Group will be launching their bitcoin futures listing. As well as cryptocurrencies most popular wallet, CoinBase, announcing just yesterday that they are soon to launch a product for institutional clients. As the price of the cryptocurrency has shown in the last week, the market seems to be taking this news fairly well. Featured Image: twitter"

According to Reuters, Vontobel is launching these futures on the SIX Exchange today. This includes two mini-futures products, that only represent a fraction of the value of standard futures.  Eric Blattman, Head of Public Distribution of Financial Products, states their products have a goal to satisfy the urge of investors for more options, specifically cryptocurrency trading.  Blattman said, “We have seen big demand for our long tracker certificate from investors interested in playing the upside potential of Bitcoin and now they have also the possibility to hedge their position or go short.” As reported by Bloomberg yesterday, Leonteq Securities AG is working on a separate project that only has a two-month maturity. Manuel Durr, head of public solutions at Leonteq, stated: “the initial feedback has been extremely positive, clients do very much appreciate the possibility of choosing between a long or a short investment in bitcoin.” This big move in Switzerland is in the middle of growing interest in cryptocurrency among typical institutional investors.  In about a month, The U.S’s major CME Group is set to launch their new bitcoin futures. Also, a New York-based startup, LedgerX, has already begun offering cryptocurrency future trades and in their first week, $1 million was already traded.  Featured Image: twitter"
1," How high do Bitcoin’s prices have to reach before the typical Bitcoin investor sells it? According to a newly published survey from LendEDU, very high at $196,165 per bitcoin which is 30 times the currencies current market value. They conducted this survey earlier this month, with 564 Americans who have invested in Bitcoin. With the extremely small size of the group that was asked these questions, the findings should be read with reasonable caution.  Michael Brown, a Research Analyst with the Survey company LendEDU, had an interview with Fortune and confirmed the data results, “Believe it or not, that number and statement is true according to our polling data.” So, what would it take to actually reach that number? When the tech-savvy younger generation spends Bitcoin, in all their everyday transactions and it steadily replaces the national currencies. Current Bitcoin investors envision that it will potentially reach that price point with the help of time and the younger generation jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon. Once that occurs, the cryptocurrency world will draw in “older” investors who were not previously sold on the concept’s potential.  Brown continued:  “As it stands today, the price of cryptocurrencies is rising rapidly yet many of the most influential, older investors are still not sold on Bitcoin and believe it will collapse. Just imagine when younger Americans develop more spending power and attempt to bring Bitcoin into the forefront of the U.S. economy? At that point, the price of Bitcoin will skyrocket.” How long exactly would this take? Possibly, a whole era.  In order for Bitcoin’s price to rise 30 times what it currently is, a generational transfer of power would need to occur. Millennials are going to need some time to establish wealth and build their presence in the economy before Bitcoin can be brought fully mainstream.  Featured Image: twitter"
1," It was an exciting weekend for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), reaching an all-time high of $2,446.31 on November 12th. At press-time, it is now selling at $1017.79, a 58 percent decrease from its high this Sunday.  Source: CoinMarketCap During BCH’s high its rival, the original cryptocurrency Bitcoin dipped below $6,000. It’s pretty clear that this highly anticipated “flippening” of the two cryptocurrencies, that some Bitcoin Cash enthusiasts predicated is now nowhere in sight. Although it had definite momentum, Bitcoin Cash’s own difficulty protocol is what halted this from actually happening.  Source: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin, as shown in the graph above, had a rollercoaster of a weekend in conjunction and connection with Bitcoin Cash’s rise. Bitcoin’s hash rate drastically fell this weekend close to 50 percent, as Bitcoin miners dropped mining Bitcoin and jumped over to Bitcoin Cash due to the monetary mining reward potentials. As mentioned earlier, Bitcoin Cash’s own difficulty protocol was its own demise, as it made Bitcoin Cashless profitable to mine and users switched back to mining Bitcoin.  At press time, Bitcoin has broken its own all-time high record from back on Nov. 8 and is now selling at $7756.28 and is up 7 percent. A lot of this Bitcoin momentum stems from the major CME Group announcing Bitcoin future tradings launching the second week of December.  Featured Image: twitter"
1," Morgan Stanley Chairman and CEO, James Gorman, had a lot to say about Bitcoin in an exclusive interview with CNBC.  Gorman states that despite it going up 700 percent this year the cryptocurrency is the definition of a “speculative investment and anyone thinking it might be stable is deluding themselves.”  Despite not sounding like a digital currency or bitcoin advocate, he did recognize the increasing adoption of it and its usability meant it was not going away “from one day to another.” Gorman goes on to describe Bitcoin as “not even close to a safe investment.” The CEO’s comments weren’t the most confident when it came to Bitcoin but it was a lot less harsh than other peers of his. JPMorgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, has had plenty to say on the world’s largest cryptocurrency and claims it to be a ‘fraud’ that will eventually blow up. The most notable comment he made recently was, “If you’re stupid enough to buy bitcoin, you’ll pay the price for it one day.” You can hear James Gorman’s full statements here.

1," Russian cybercrime suspect, Alexander Vinnik, has been held in Greece since July when the U.S requested him to be arrested while he was on vacation with his family. He is directly tied to the obsolete BTC-e bitcoin exchange and is wanted by both the US and Russia for laundering Bitcoin.  His extradition hearing was set for today but was postponed because they are waiting for two witnesses to attend the hearing. It has been rescheduled for Dec. 6th. He is currently at the center of a judicial battle between the U.S and Russia, who is seeking his extradition on lesser charges. The U.S seeks to prosecute Mr. Vinnik for $4 Billion USD worth of laundered bitcoin through BTC-e, whereas Russia only accuses him of 667,000-ruble ($11,500) of fraud.  Athens courts have approved the extradition requests of both countries, but Vinnik is only appealing his extradition to the U.S. He is denying all charges on both sides but is not contesting being extradited to his home country. He has acknowledged working for BTC-e but strongly declares his innocence. Coincidentally, BTC-e has relaunched after their domain was confiscated by law enforcement and they deny any involvement with the suspect, Vinnik.   One of Vinnik’s lawyers, Alexandros Lykourezos, explains the reason for the postponement of the hearing by saying:  “We asked the court to postpone the hearing today of the U.S. request for the extradition of Vinnik so that two essential witnesses can come who couldn’t unfortunately come to Athens today. These witnesses will be able to testify and help the court understand the essential issues that arise from this case.” The suspect is being indicted by a grand jury in North District of California, as reported by the U.S Justice Department, and is facing charges of engaging in unlawful monetary transactions, money laundering, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. In the U.S these charges combined hold a maximum sentence of up to 20 years in federal prison. On December 6th Greece’s justice minister might have to make the final decision if Greece’s Supreme Court upholds the lower court’s order. Featured Image: twitter"
1," I’m sure all of you at some point have made a purchase and the retail attendant used that tiny white square on a smart device to process a payment; Well, Square Inc has now jumped into the cryptocurrency space. This payment giant is letting a number of its users on its Square Cash app purchase Bitcoin. Square Cash, a main competitor of Venmo, allows its customers to send peer-to-peer payments and store money without the need to connect to a bank account.  Square has been making huge waves on Twitter, which I’m sure has made Jack Dorsey thrilled, as he is the CEO of both companies.  “First Square Cash. Then major banks,” one user wrote, via twitter.  Another wrote, “Bomb of the year: Buy Bitcoin with Square Cash. As easy as 123. Goodbye Coinbase.”  In an email statement sent Wednesday morning a Square Cash spokesperson states: “We’re always listening to our customers and we’ve found that they are interested in using the Cash App to buy Bitcoin. We’re exploring how Square can make this experience faster and easier, and have rolled out this feature to a small number of Cash App customers. We believe cryptocurrency can greatly impact the ability of individuals to participate in the global financial system and we’re excited to learn more here.”  Source: twitter Currently, the app only has the capabilities of letting its users buy, sell and hold Bitcoins but lacks the capability of making peer-to-peer payments with the cryptocurrency. Making payments to peers is the app’s primary use, and the company sees this as being the primary function to roll-out in the future.  Credit Suisse’s AG analyst Paul Condra had some positive things to say about the company. In a note to clients today,  he said, “Given Square’s tendency to move judiciously into new technologies, we expect it will do the same with bitcoin purchases. The upside could be significant if cryptocurrencies become more mainstream.” Both Bitcoin and Square have grown exponentially this year.

Back in 2014, Jack Dorsey let its e-commerce merchants accept Bitcoin but didn’t see much activity. He’s hoping for more activity with the cryptocurrency this go around.  Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#charts Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, has had a monumental year as well, as its value has soared up 7 times what it was since January 1st. Bitcoin now sits at just over $7200 a coin. It has the highest market cap, $113 billion, among thousands of other cryptocurrencies, and it speculated to continue its bullish climb despite a few bumps throughout the year.  With both Square and Bitcoin having monumental years, it’s easy to see why Dorsey and the Square Cash team are making moves towards Bitcoin. The main users of his app are the younger generation and he said in a statement that he sees digital currency especially appealing to this generation. He also recalls someone once telling him that, “Gold is a stupid rock.”  Venmo is owned by Paypal and is Square Cash’s largest competitor. They are also in a great position to offer bitcoin services. However, the company has announced no moves in this direction yet. The New York Times Reported back in October that Square Cash had passed Venmo as being the most frequently downloaded financial app on both Apple and Android phones.  With how hot cryptocurrency has become this year, maybe their Bitcoin buying/selling offering will make the app that much more appealing. Featured Image: beat.10ztalk.com"
1," The British hedge fund founded in 1783, Man Group, is patiently waiting on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to launch their bitcoin futures scheduled for the second week of next month. Man Group’s CEO, Luke Ellis, told Reuters that his firm has plans of adding Bitcoin to their “investment universe” once CME’s futures contracts are approved and listed for trading.  The CEO stated: “Conceptually digital currencies are an interesting thing. It’s not part of our investment universe today – it could be. If there is a CME future on bitcoin, it would be.” Ellis believes that there are many hurdles cryptocurrencies still need to overcome to achieve mainstream adoption despite not having government backing, but he doesn’t believe that it currently makes them non-investable. He also told Reuters: “There is a big difference between a digital currency and a traditional currency…Traditional ones are supported by governments who have armies and tax men that can make people follow their rules, and digital ones don‘t,” he continued. “But that doesn’t invalidate digital currencies at all.” He did not state specifically if their firm will explore directly with the cryptocurrency markets or trade CME’s specific futures. Despite the uncertainty, this announcement is additional confirmation that mainstream investors are observing a way into the bitcoin environment. CME’s exchange is going to have “bumpers” to prevent the market from shifting too far one way, due to it being traded in the typical regulated environment. Trading can also be paused during times of high volatility. CME’s chairman, Leo Melamed, made a statement recently expressing his beliefs that using this framework will “tame bitcoin into a mainstream financial instrument.” Analysts are highly anticipating that after CME’s futures launch large figures of capital will flood in from Wall Street, minimizing Bitcoin’s volatility and aiding it in its maturity as an asset class.

1," For years, finding ways to prove a person’s identity with 100 percent accuracy has been an extremely complex task. Iris scans, fingerprint cards, and cards such as a passport are used currently as proof of identity.  Unfortunately, most of these biometric systems demand large amounts of infrastructure and are costly, while the cheaper alternatives are not as secure. However, one thing may change that; Blockhain Digital Identification. Canada is now welcoming a new cost-effective identification platform that is based solely on blockchain technology and gives Canadian citizens the opportunity to prove who they are in an instant, with 100 percent accuracy. Blockchain technology is the underlying structure of this completely definitive and cost reducing solution. Individuals would store all of their personal encrypted data and information on a personal phone.  When they would need to share their identity at, let’s say an airport, they would give their private key to this institution in order for them to access this information. They would access this information through the blockchain and it would be made available to this specific institution only.  This option gives consumers a simple solution if they don’t want their information stored in various databases, making it more accessible for hackers to obtain such data. SelfKey, a similar startup, is now offering very similar solutions for those outside of Canada and are launching their token sales soon. The shift of moving personal data onto individual storage devices would keep more data secure as these large hackers wouldn’t be able to obtain large chunks of personal information in just one sweep. The most recent Equifax hack wouldn’t have occurred because each person’s data would be safely stored on their own individual devices with their own private keys. This blockchain identity system is set to launch in Canada in early 2018. Featured Image: twitter"
1," Although it was a whirlwind weekend, it seems that Bitcoin is on the rise. At press time, it is up 10% in just 24 hours and its price is sitting at $7228.11. Starting Friday, the digital coin sat under $7000 up until this morning.  Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#charts The competitor that gave Bitcoin a run for its money this weekend, Bitcoin Cash, is currently down 8% in the last 24 hours and is sitting at $1227.31. Many predicted that after this weekend’s events there would be a complete swap of the two and the off-shoot would take over the entire market. It appears the weekend was full of highs and lows but essentially signified nothing. With such a substantial drop in the cryptocurrency over the weekend, a substantial buying opportunity arose. Investors that took advantage of the price ‘dip’ at around $5,700, saw a 20 percent return in just 72 hours. Further justifying the ever-present bitcoin investing strategy of buying in the dip and then “hold on for dear life.” The chaos was initiated by the planned upgrade, SegWit2x, being canceled a week ago. Currently, the cryptocurrency remains steady, despite the many bumps in 2017. Featured Image: twitter"
1," On the local Zimbabwe exchange of Golix, Bitcoin is currently trading large at the equivalent of $12,000 USD, per coin. This may seem absurd for most of us living elsewhere to spend so much on one Bitcoin but Zimbabweans, however, the cryptocurrency offers a rare “safe haven” from its country’s inevitable financial implosion due to hyperinflation.  There have been reports that over the years, the inflation had driven its residents to carry entire backpacks in cash in order to pay for weekly groceries. Cash is now running short in banks as inflation rises and banks are now putting caps as to how much can be spent outside of the country.  As residents are losing value to their bank deposits by the day, they’ve turned to Bitcoin out of complete desperation. Zimbabwe’s president, Robert Mugabe, is urging its residents to take risks on the cryptocurrency, as its country is in a complete desperate state. Arnold Manhizwa, a 34-year-old father of two that works for an IT and Telecoms Company, told Reuters, “I have now changed all my reserves to bitcoin because that is the only way I can protect my investment. If I have $500 in the bank I won’t get it back and I will be losing value, but when I have my bitcoin it is going up every day.” The banks have begun halting and capping Visa and Mastercard bank transactions overseas, and with that Zimbabweans have found it extremely difficult to make payments internationally. Using Bitcoin bypasses the need to get foreign currency from the banks for payments and even makes it easier to buy goods from the growing merchants that now accept cryptocurrency.  The central bank is responsible for approving overseas transactions and they’ve stated that they currently have an estimated $500 million in pending foreign payments. They also prioritize payments such as fuel and medication, making the process even slower. Some upper class families that have sent their sons and daughters overseas for university are finding it extremely difficult to help fund them, with these pending transactions.   An analyst setting up a Bitcoin trading desk at a local bank brought up that it may seem attractive to move everything over to Bitcoin now, but states, “Once foreigners sell their bitcoin, they won’t have a way of getting their money out.” Featured Image: undispatch.com"
1," In an interview with CNBC yesterday, The CEO of the CME Group confirmed that they are set to launch Bitcoin futures trading by mid-December.  Terry Duffy suggested their introduction of these futures will now be “sometime in the second week” of December. Bitcoin’s markets have fluctuated over the past week, as their projected upgrade was halted and markets seriously challenged by its rival Bitcoin Cash. Duffy’s statement yesterday seemed to have brought some stability to the Bitcoin Market.  Souce: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#charts As per Coin Market Cap, Bitcoin is currently trading above $6,500 as its volatility diminishes. It seems Bitcoin has found its footing once more, as it has regained some of its strength from plummeting this past weekend as its rival Bitcoin Cash surged. It is still below $1,300 from last week’s all-time records. CME first made their announcement towards the end of October and there was speculation that it was responsible for the bullish surge of BTC up until late last week. Duffy states that he plans to offer a risk assessment area for Wall Street institutional traders.  He told CNBC, “I’m not trying to rein in the volatility of Bitcoin but what I want to do is give it a place for other people to lay out that risk. Today you cannot short Bitcoin. So there’s only one way it can go.” Bitcoin, at press time, is currently trading at $6636.86 up 2% in 24hrs. Featured Image: twitter"
1," A state-owned electric utility in China is rebuffing rumors that bitcoin mining has been deemed illegal by the government. However, some are still fearful there will be a ban on Bitcoin mining. Rumours spread in the past day – based on circulated document- revealing that the country’s State Grid was moving to ban bitcoin mining at a country level in the Sichuan province, an ostensibly notable development given the area’s abundant water supply for electricity generation and the fact that profit-chasing bitcoin miners are headquartered in the region. A translated document states that “bitcoin mining is an illegal activity. Each State Grid connected generator that is involved in powering Bitcoin mining is also regarded as an illegal practice, which shall prohibited.” The document was quickly circulated and reported by Chinese local media which raised questions about whether such a decision may signal an administrative move against bitcoin mining. According to Chinese business publication Caixin, local executives from the country branch confirmed the authenticity of the report but clarified it’s only an internal memo and some of the phrases were drafted incorrectly. Further, the document comes from a country branch instead of a statewide level, thus diminishing the weight it might carry. Featured Image: twitter"
1," Yesterday, at around 4PM EDT on block 504,031, the Bitcoin Cash Network (BCH) completed a successful hard fork. The new software that was initiated yesterday is specifically geared towards the rules of reward distribution and it was aimed at making it more attractive to the miner that secure this blockchain. Currently, the new version of the blockchain has assembled six blocks, while there has been zero mining on the older Bitcoin Cash network. Like any potential hard fork complication, with zero mining on the old blockchain they’ve successfully avoided a competing cryptocurrency being built. Yesterday’s hard fork switched a protocol to an alternative mining algorithm that will positively adjust how difficult it is for the miners to create new blocks on the blockchain, increasing it to every 600 seconds. The reason the BCH developers decided to initiate this, is a large number of miners have been switching frequently between mining Bitcoin and the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, shifting to whichever blockchain is offering the most rewards at that given time.  Many of the BCH supporters believe this is now going to “level” the playing field and should be fair without any miners gaming the system. What didn’t change with this network is their 8MB block size, that is what started this alternative cryptocurrency that was hard forked off the Bitcoin blockchain back in August.  The urgent need for this mining change had many developers believing this upgrade would run smoothly and without contention.  Earlier this week in various Bitcoin Cash specific cryptocurrency channels, major mining pool operators expressed their support for these upgrades. The mining algorithm had been producing wild fluctuations in hash rate and the upgrade aimed at fixing that. In the blog post specifically outlining this hard fork and its upgraded software, it detailed the current rule as “problematic because it prevents consistently fast confirmations for users, and radically shifts the coin issuance schedule.” Juan Garavaglia, a developer who coordinated the hard fork, wanted to stamp it as a success, indicating his optimism that all Bitcoin Cash networks will make the upgrade. If this new software upgrade lasts, it could mean great things for Bitcoin Cash.  The protocols have been strongly advocated as the planned hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain was suspended last week. Said hard fork, Segwit2x, was geared towards increasing bitcoin’s block size from 1MB to 2MB. With the suspended upgrade, Bitcoin supporters have been drifting to other alternatives. Starting its bullish climb Friday, Bitcoin Cash rose to a value of almost $2,500 Sunday, a record high. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin has dropped close to $1,000 in value, now sitting at $6588.37 from its previous record high on November 8th at $7515.68. Bitcoin’s value has not been this low since the end of October.  Souce: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#charts Chinese tax accountant Yimo Cheng, who mines bitcoin out of his home, claims he hasn’t started to mine Bitcoin Cash due to his concern about its ownership being concentrated among the Chinese buyers.  He believes that bitcoin is currently more “international” but plans on monitoring the two blockchains moving forward. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© PromesaStudio"
1," Starting on Friday morning, Bitcoin’s price suffered yet another huge drop while it’s offshoot, Bitcoin Cash, soared up to at one point close to 50%, causing many to raise concerns about a potential Bitcoin death spiral. The Bitcoin Cash rally was so substantial that on Sunday, it briefly surpassed the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, with its total market value at $29.9 billion. Bitcoin’s price at its lowest this weekend saw a 29% drop but the most concerning figure calculated was its hash rate which fell at close to 50 percent. A hash rate is the amount of computational power committed to mining each digital coin.  Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/ A steep and drawn-out drop in the Bitcoin hash rate has the capability of setting off a much-feared “chain death spiral” that could leave the bitcoin network entirely useless. This specific metric is vital for a coin like bitcoin, particularly when its reason for dropping is directly correlated with a competitor taking its spotlight.  Bitcoin Cash reached record-breaking highs at almost $2,400 and it also depleted a lot of hash power from Bitcoin simultaneously.   How exactly does this death spiral work? The current Bitcoin network adds a new bundle of transactions, known as a “block,” at a rough estimate of every 10 minutes, or so. This exact time is measured by how long it takes for a miner to process this block of transactions. This, in its proper sequence, is then set by something called the “difficulty” on the bitcoin network. The difficulty automatically adjusts itself to match the hash rate so that the transactions won’t take too long to process. The difficulty is only adjusting every two weeks. If the hash rate unexpectedly plummets this difficulty could be interpreted too high for the quantity of processing power of the network. If this occurs, it could mean major delays in the completion of Bitcoin transactions. Over the weekend, the spiral was mentioned throughout the cryptocurrency community with it on the edge of a disastrous failure. Said spiral starts when transactions are delayed and the network’s utility gets reduced. Its investors decide to stop “dumping” coins causing a sharp price drop. Miners, then begin mining other coins due to the network delay and the lower price of the cryptocurrency, which makes mining less profitable. The cycle would continue, with both miners and investors completely abandoning the coin, creating long delays in transactions times and preventing the “difficulty” adjustment from occurring to “break” the vicious cycle.  Peter Kim, a co-founder of a developer tool named Nitrous described the cycle as, “Transactions get backlogged to a point where the coin becomes basically useless.” Think that this scenario seems a bit far-fetched? Over the weekend, it came extremely close to happening. As everyone’s eyes were glued to the price of Bitcoin, they weren’t looking at the bigger picture.  Source: https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate Over a two day period, Bitcoin’s hash rate fell 50 percent as miners switched from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash because of the profit, as shown in the graph above. This drop indicated that the transaction times on the bitcoin network doubled, from 10 minutes to about 20 minutes or more.  A Bitcoin Analyst, Jimmy Song, explained why Bitcoin Cash suddenly became so attractive to miners. He said, “Bitcoin Cash was up to 100 percent more profitable to mine because of the price run-up. When it’s more profitable to mine Bitcoin Cash, miners will go there. When it’s more profitable to mine Bitcoin like right now, miners will go there.” Bitcoin Cash’s own mining difficulty increases ironically saved Bitcoin and halted the death spiral.  The algorithm governing its adjustments generated the rise in its difficulty, making Bitcoin Cash less profitable to mine.  Bitcoin Cash’s developers didn’t want volatile hash rates within their cryptocurrency, so they adjusted their difficulty adjustment rules on November 13th by way of a hard fork, but it was too late. By the time they initiated the upgrades, many of the miners had already switched back to bitcoin. According to fork.lol and the graph above, Bitcoin has gained about 20 percentage points from where it was at before the drop and the death spiral has been avoided. Featured Image: theatlantic.com"
0," Bitcoin Classic this week announced on its website it is officially shutting down, and they credit themselves for the current bullish traction of Bitcoin Cash. The developers of “classic” claim Bitcoin Cash (BCH) will become new Bitcoin by May of 2018.  Tom Zander praised Bitcoin Cash in the statement claiming its validity meant that Bitcoin Classic “fulfilled its promise.” He also said, “It is now up to you which chain will gain the most traction. It is now up to the next billion people to start to use Bitcoin Cash. In at most six months I’m sure we’ll just drop the ‘Cash’ and call it ‘Bitcoin.’” At the time of reporting, Bitcoin Cash has shot up in price over 49 percent at $943.49, in the last 24 hours. This is its highest value since its debut back in mid-August.  Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/ Funds seem to be flowing into the Bitcoin rival, after the highly anticipated Bitcoin network upgrade, SegWit2x, was shut down on Wednesday. This sudden halt was due to the decline in support from its developing team and fear of a potential blockchain split, thus creating another Bitcoin rival. Zander had some words to say about the decision of Bitcoin to not go ahead with the upgrade stating, “The fact that the Legacy chain is stuck at 1 MB, and likely always will be, confirms the Cash chain’s viability. Now the market will decide.”  Before the news of this upcoming hard fork, Bitcoin Cash had been stagnant. Now, there is much support pouring in from public and investors, as its price has skyrocketed. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© spaxiax"
0," Bitcoin’s investors are losing confidence as its price continues to drop past 5% at $6773.29 in just 24 hrs and its lowest, since November 1st. Traders have begun to bet on the coin’s ‘offshoot’, Bitcoin Cash, which split from its original version back in August. 
  Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/ Analysts say the surge is down due to developers pulling the plug on SegWit2x, a planned upgrade aimed at improving transaction speed on the network. The Director of the CFD Broker XTB, Joshua Raymond, told Business Insider: “The delay to Segwit2x has damaged confidence amongst bitcoin investors concerning the much-needed resolution to speed up bitcoin’s slow processing speed. Everyone was hoping the Segwit2x would address this but unfortunately, the delay due to a lack of consensus on the mechanics has affected confidence. Confidence in transaction speed in Bitcoin has deteriorated significantly in recent months. As Bitcoin Cash enjoys much faster transaction speeds, we have started to see a recycling of positions out of Bitcoin into Bitcoin Cash as a consequence.” Bitcoin Cash was initiated by way of a “fork” which splits the blockchain record, creating a completely new network. The incentive behind developers jumping ship to the new coin is that it allows for larger “blocks” to be processed, which makes the network much faster.  While the new SegWit2x upgrade had intentions of speeding up the original blockchain, many developers originally backed it and then began falling off close to its deadline. The hard fork also posed the risk of the network being split again, thus creating more competition. An Analyst from the trading platform eToro, said, “After the 2x hard fork was called off, BCH is now being seen as a favorite to one day replace BTC. If the community doesn’t come to a consensus about how to scale the network soon, it may run into congestion, in which case people will need an alternative.”  Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/#charts As developers scramble to come up with a reasonable solution to their slow network problem, Bitcoin Cash continues to rise. It seems some traders have jumped ship because, in just the last 24 hours alone, the off-shoot currency’s price has risen over 35% at $855.43. However, the original cryptocurrency has bounced back from adversity in the past, the digital currency’s price is up seven times what it was at the beginning of 2017. By the end of this year, the world’s largest futures exchange, CME, is launching Bitcoin futures, another positive step in the longevity of the cryptocurrency.

0," Many big-name figures in the financial industry have been publically criticizing Bitcoin lately, reporting it as a “bubble.” JPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Morgan is the most noted critic of the original digital currency.  Yet, because of its transparent and its mathematical and decentralized character, calling it a bubble of any kind is highly inaccurate. Back in 2013, there was a Bitcoin bubble per se, when the demand for Bitcoin rose to a point where it could no longer be fully supported by the market and dropped from $1,300 to $200. Calling it a “bubble”, however, is still an inaccurate description, just like it’s inaccurate to describe Tesla and Amazon in the same way. Up until the end of this Spring, analysts continued to describe Tesla’s value increase as a bubble, as they did Amazon throughout its 20 years of business. The transportation editor of Business Insider a few months ago made a statement about Tesla saying, “At this point, a Tesla bubble looks obvious and it looks as obvious as it has since early this year. The difference now is that it’s grown so large that it’s become terrifying.” Any emerging company, startup, or technology that has an accelerated increase in their value or growth is now being seen by experts, as “bubbles.” With many major corrections from 2013 to 2017, Tesla’s price has increased from around $20 to $302. Since its beginning, Tesla has recovered from several setbacks and developed a stable sustainable business and, more importantly, a consumer base extremely similar to how Bitcoin evolved into a viable financial network and captured active user bases of tens of millions of people. Furthermore, Bitcoin has significantly matured since its launch in 2009. Apple’s co-founder and Billionaire Steve Wozniak recently described Bitcoin as more legitimate and transparent than “most systems in existence today.” In his interview with Money 2020 he stated: ”There is a certain finite amount of Bitcoin that can ever exist. Gold gets mined and mined and mined. Maybe there’s a finite amount of gold in the world, but Bitcoin is even more mathematical and regulated and nobody can change mathematics.” Featured Image: twitter"
0," The next generation of investors has spoken. A survey recently held online by Harris Poll uncovered that more than 1 in 4 millennials prefer ditching stocks for Bitcoin. The results were based on more than 2,000 adults participating, that were over the age of 18 during October of 2017. Bitcoin and the additional cryptocurrencies are perfectly suitable to the millennial mindset, as most are fed up with traditional banking and the dominion of old money and traditional investing. Investing in millennials has taken a shift toward digital currencies. It’s not just stocks that many millennials favor Bitcoin over, it’s other traditional financial assets as well. The survey question asked: Comparing Bitcoin to other forms of financial assets, would you prefer to own $1,000 worth of Bitcoin or $1,000 worth of (stocks, government bonds, real estate, gold)? Yes/No (Yes answers represented as percentages in the chart below)  Source: http://www.survey.blockchain.capital/ Nonetheless, the survey also showed that only 4% of this generation actually own or have owned bitcoin, while they prefer it over the traditional methods they are reluctant to pull the trigger. For the older generations who have always trusted in bonds and stocks, it’s easy to understand why their interest in the digital currency is smaller. As cryptocurrency is more widely adopted and becomes more mainstream, there will most likely be an interest shift. For most millennials ‘mainstream’ isn’t cool and that is most likely a big reason as to why Bitcoin is popular among the specific age group. While I’m sure it may seem mainstream for those in the cryptocurrency space, there is still a long way to go. Wall Street has started entering the digital currency world, with EFTs and futures starting to look more and more like a reality. The target audience will definitely be the younger generation but with their hand in it, interest might spread across the various generations. Featured Image: forbes"
1," The highly controversial hard fork anticipated to take place a few days from now on the Bitcoin blockchain has been suspended. The upgrade, named SegWit2x, was aimed at increasing block size. Early on there was strong support for the from Bitcoin startups and mining pools. The upgrade was anticipated to happen on November 16th and occurring on block 494,784. 2x’s goal was to increase bitcoin’s transaction capacity, which is currently held back by the nature of the current software’s rules. This halt in the upgrade was announced to the public today via email from BitGo’s CEO Mike Belshe. He was one of the main leaders of the Segwit2x project. He wrote: “Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean block size upgrade at this time. Continuing on the current path could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin’s growth. This was never the goal of Segwit2x. Until then, we are suspending our plans for the upcoming 2MB upgrade.” Due to this halt, the price of Bitcoin hit another record high of $7,848.31 according to CoinDesk. Although, by the afternoon it hit a session low of $7,078.96.

0," By now, most people have heard of the term ‘Bitcoin’. But do you know why this digital currency is garnering national attention? It’s because bitcoin is a huge deal. Some have even gone as far as calling it ‘gold 2.0’.  And why shouldn’t they? Bitcoin is one of the biggest trends our generation has ever seen. It’s certainly one of the most important inventions since the internet.   Don’t believe me? Just ask Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, or Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group.  Branson has said that there is a massive industry surrounding the digital currency, and “people have made fortunes out of bitcoin.”  Gates believes bitcoin is exciting because it shows just how cheap it can be. “Bitcoin is better than currency because you don’t have to physically be in the same place.” What does Gates mean when he says one doesn’t have to be in the same place? Well, here’s where things really start to get interesting: There is no such thing as a bitcoin company or building. In fact, there isn’t even a bitcoin server to shut down even if one wanted too. Bitcoin is completely distributed and that’s what makes it so unique.  It’s a way to exchange value online without a third-party intermediary. While it’s true bitcoin might endure a few ups and downs – like any other emerging technology – bitcoin still appears to be here to stay. In fact, there are a few who believe that one bitcoin could be worth between half a million dollars and a million dollars in 10 years time. So, the question that remains is: is bitcoin the currency of the future? It certainly seems that way. Some have even suggested that the black chain encryption behind bitcoin has the ability to bring the world out of poverty. So what are you waiting for? Get out there and do some research; build yourself a bitcoin wallet and learn about all the ways in which this is going to improve the lives of people on this planet because bitcoin truly is one of the most important inventions of humankind.

1," Bitcoin catapulted past $7,400 on Friday morning, rising almost 6% and breaking its previous record the day before of almost $7,000. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value has seen a steady bull trend since Wednesday when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world’s largest derivatives trading house by volume, announced that they will launch trading for Bitcoin futures, before the end of this year. Analysts believe more institutional investors could potentially warm up to the digital token after Wednesday’s announcement.  Charles Hayter, Ceo of Crypto Compare told CNBC in an email: “This is bitcoin crossing the divide from the wild west of finance to the mainstream. Futures from an incumbent exchange bring bitcoin and cryptocurrencies into the regulatory fold. This allows more complex financial products to be created and will eventually open the doors to institutional money.” This skyrocketed movement following CME’s press release also saw the total value of all of all cryptocurrencies climb to over $200 billion, a new record high. The market cap of Bitcoin, being the most valued cryptocurrency by a wide margin, takes up most of the overall value sitting just at $124 billion. The price of Bitcoin has risen 640 percent since the beginning of 2017.  CNBC reported on Wednesday of this week that Amazon, the e-commerce giant, secured three new domain names in relation to cryptocurrency. The three new domain names they bought were: amazonethereum.com, amazoncryptocurrency.com, and amazoncryptocurrencies.com. Amazon already owned the domain name of amazonbitcoin.com but the VP of Amazon Pay, Patrick Gauthier, told CNBC when they inquired about this very thing last month, that Amazon has no plans on accepting cryptocurrency, as there is not any current demand. As for the buying of the domain names currently, it’s likely due to them just securing the sites to protect their brand name as cryptocurrency continues to grow. On many occasions companies buy various domains surrounded by their name to secure their brand. However, with how competitive Amazon has become on crushing their opponents, their shift into the cryptocurrency space is inevitable. Bitcoin has a higher market cap than major companies like Nike and American Express. As more and more businesses start accepting Bitcoin as well as other digital currencies, their hand will be forced in order to keep their monstrous market share intact. Bitcoin is being faced with another hard “fork” in its blockchain scheduled to occur later this month. Currently, its investors and miners, volunteers who process the transactions and add them to the blockchain, are currently split on the movement of the asset. The mining of the Bitcoin blockchain is a long procedure and a group of developers is brainstorming ways to speed up the mining process. Bitcoin has already endured two forks earlier this year, and new cryptocurrencies emerged because of them. Bitcoin Cash was created in August and just last month, another hard fork created Bitcoin Gold. There have been a number of critics recently that have expressed their doubts on cryptocurrency. On Thursday during a press conference, the New York Times reported that Tidjane Thiam, the CEO of Credit Suisse, stated that bitcoin was the “very definition of a bubble.” Credit Suisse, happens to be the second largest bank in Switzerland. In a note this morning, Oliver White, an economist at Fathom Financial Consulting, stated that as an asset, Bitcoin was “intrinsically worthless.” “Bitcoin fans will doubtless argue that it’s no different from fiat money in this respect. But that’s to do a disservice to notes and coin, in our view. Notes and coin have government backing,” White states. On the other hand, Business Insider released a video on October 19th interviewing one of Wall Street’s top strategist on his predictions of Bitcoin.  Tom Lee, Co-Founder of FundStrat Global Advisor, described in this interview his different methodologies in valuing Bitcoin. Lee has over 25 years experience in Wall Street equity research and every year since 1998, has been top-ranked by Institutional Investor. He projected Bitcoin’s value by the middle of 2018 to reach $6,000 but due to recent events, it has far surpassed his projected numbers. His long-term projection was bitcoin would reach $25,000 by 2020. You can view the full interview below:  Featured Image: depositphotos/spaxiax"
1," Many are wondering, ‘is bitcoin just a bubble?.”  Tidjane Thiam, the Chief Executive Officer of Switzerland’s second-largest bank, Credit Suisse, has made his position known on the issue. The New York Times reports that the banking chief called Bitcoin’s anonymity a major “challenge” before saying, “From what we can identify, the only reason today to buy or sell Bitcoin is to make money, which is the very definition of speculation and the very definition of a bubble.” Bitcoin reached a record high of $7,000, which happens to be seven times its value from the beginning of 2017. Other big bankers have similar views to Thiam’s, JPMorgan Chase & Co’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, recently called Bitcoin a “fraud” that will eventually implode. Of the most notable to comment on this “bubble” theory was the one and only billionaire investor Warren Buffett.  Criminal use of the cryptocurrency and their belief of criminals being able to hide their activities with its anonymity, is another big potential drawback bankers see from the cryptocurrency and its blockchain.  Thiam said, “Most banks in the current state of regulation have little or no appetite to get involved in a currency which has such anti-money laundering challenges,” Bitcoin’s new high has been all over the news, Thiam adds that he still expects interest in the world’s largest cryptocurrency to subside. Still, while bitcoin is being stiff-armed by most banking officials, banks are in a race to develop and implement blockchain technology in their systems. Featured Image: twitter"
1," In order to protect themselves from cyber criminals known as “ransomware extortionists”, companies in the U.K have been increasing their positions in Bitcoin. This sudden interest in the cryptocurrency could have contributed to its recent rallies. This was what Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:$CTXS) CEO, Kirill Tatarinov said on Monday in response to TheStreet’s founder, Jim Cramer’s question at a panel discussing cybersecurity concerns at The Deal’s 2017 corporate governance conference. The issue at hand here are the ransomware attacks, and how various companies deal with such difficult situations. Ransomware is the act of cyber criminals hacking into a company sensitive information, and then demanding payment in Bitcoins to not destroy company data or networks. The WannaCry outbreak was such a case that cornered many companies, possibly fuelling the surge in Bitcoin value. It’s good to note that cyber criminals prefer payment in Bitcoins due to the untraceable and anonymous aspect of the currency. “We’ve seen people pay up after ransomware attacks,” said Tatarinov in an interview. “We’ve seen people who are proactively bulking up on bitcoin anticipating those attacks. We’ve seen companies proactively, we saw a couple examples in the U.K., where companies are proactively building up their Bitcoin to excesses so they can pay up. This is happening.” With over 400,000 companies, the twenty-eight-year old company that is Citrix Systems is a cloud service that provides secure digital workspaces, much like a very secure google drive, allowing users to securely access their work information from any device. The Ransomware attacks that made its rounds last month was supposedly the results of a weakness in the Windows operating system that was allegedly discovered by the U.S. National Security Agency. The information of the Windows weakness was posted by a group known as the “Shadow Brokers”. As such, with fear of a WannaCry repeat driving purchases by various U.K firms, consistent stockpiling may have something to do with Bitcoin’s surge in value from $1,692 on May 12, to its peaks of $2785 in June.  Although the value of Bitcoin has thought to have been derived from pure speculation, the reality that firms are stockpiling Bitcoin in order to pay off cyber criminals has suggested a legion of buyers that use Bitcoin for practical purposes. “Now I know why bitcoin went up so much,” – Jim Cramer, Founder of TheStreet Featured Image: depositphotos/merznatalia"
