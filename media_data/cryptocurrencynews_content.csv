" The cryptomarket is rallying today from the emergence of a Bitcoin golden cross. Now, the majority of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap are in the green according to CoinMarketCap. Leading the rally with a 5% gain at the time of writing is Bitcoin (BTC). The current price of $5,599 USD per coin is a new high for Bitcoin in 2019, and the bulls are excited. But the news gets better for Bitcoin fans because, as stated, the first Bitcoin golden cross since October 2015 has formed. A golden cross is a technical chart pattern that indicates a major rally is on the horizon. According to Investopedia: “The golden cross appears on a chart when a stock’s short-term moving average crosses above its long-term moving average.” So with this bullish signal, Bitcoin looks set to change to a “long-term bearish-to-bullish trend.” If it can close above the $5,500 mark today, Bitcoin could rally to $6,000 USD in the coming days. The Bitcoin golden cross isn’t the only signal to indicate a rally. Tom Lee’s Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI) is spurring on the positive sentiment also. Recently the Fundstrat Global Advisors founder stated that his company’s Bitcoin sentiment indicator recently touched a value of 89. According to his expertise, this means a “bull market is likely starting.” Lee noted that the BMI was over 50 throughout 2018 and has never appeared in a bear market. April has been a good month for Bitcoin price. Growing 35% already in this month, the Bitcoin golden cross now signals further gains to come. This growth spurt means Bitcoin is on track to have the best month since December 2017, when the Bitcoin frenzy was in full swing. >> IIN Blockchain Expanding: How JPMorgan Wants to Improve Banking As is usual with the cryptocurrency market, where Bitcoin goes, altcoins often follow. Other major gainers in the top ten today include Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Cardano (ADA), up 3.52% and 2.5% respectively. The second largest coin by market cap, Ethereum (ETH), is currently up 2.17% and selling for $174.85 USD. On the other hand, Binance Coin (BNB) and Stellar (XLM) are down today, 2.17% and 0.29% respectively. What do you think? Is the Bitcoin golden cross a strong indicator of a bullish run on the horizon? Featured Image: DepositPhotos © 1StunningArt",23-Apr,2019
" If you want to buy things on Amazon using Bitcoin, you now can. All you need is the Bitcoin lightning network and crypto payment processing startup Moon. In time, the service will extend to many e-commerce sites also, not just Amazon. Let’s check this out. The startup announced today that any lightning-enabled wallet can now be used through Moon’s browser extension. Before this, the service could be used by connecting the browser extension to exchange accounts like Coinbase. According to Moon CEO Ken Kruger, it works like this: “[The extension] will pop up a QR code and it will have the lightning invoice, which you could also copy and paste if you can’t use the QR code for some reason, and you’ll be able to pay with your favorite lightning wallet.” Customers should note that Amazon has nothing to do with the Bitcoin payment. The conversion from Bitcoin to fiat currency is taken care of behind the scenes by an unspecified third party. Therefore, Amazon merchants receive fiat currency and never have to deal with Bitcoin, but the user gets to use Bitcoin as he/she so wishes. Kruger maintains that the lightning-enabled feature should work on almost any e-commerce site by 2020 as “there’s no direct merchant integration.” This is also regardless of whether that platform accepts Bitcoin directly. Aside from Bitcoin, Moon also manages payment channels, offering an interface for sending payments. As Kruger furthered: “We’re integrating with the Visa and Mastercard networks and we get a cut of the interchange fees that merchants pay every time they receive a credit card transaction.” >> Cryptocurrency Bear Market Wanes: Going through Accumulation Founded in New York last year, Moon is looking very promising. Born of a $100,000 investment, the company has already come quite far and is now looking for a Series A funding round in 2019. Further, the company is looking for “opportunities to help solve some of those usability problems” and to “engage with other folks in the lightning community to see what people are doing, what they’re working on and if there are any significant gaps. We’d love to step in and help whenever possible.” What do you think? Would you use Moon to buy your wares on Amazon? Featured Image: DepositPhotos © belchonock",22-Apr,2019
" The cryptocurrency top ten are in the green! Well, eight of them are at least. According to CoinMarketCap, the total cryptocurrency market cap today is $182,807,737,820. As usual, when Bitcoin price is in the green, the rest of the market tends to be too. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is showing gains of a respectable 1.13%—a continued increase from a bull run now lasting over a week. Further down the chart, EOS is running away with a 6.84% increase. What has Bitcoin in the green as of late? The entire market is bullish so let’s check out why this is. At the time of writing, Bitcoin price is $5,285.08 USD, up 1.29% at the time of writing. Bitcoin has been on a bull run since April 2nd and not only has maintained the high but has continued to steadily increase. Over the course of a few hours on April 2nd, Bitcoin jumped from approximately $4,110 to $4,800. Now it has hit a current high of over $5,285. The rally has extended throughout the market with other coins also showing massive growth. For example, Litecoin gained over 50% and Bitcoin Cash roughly 80% in the same period. Two theories have emerged as to what caused Bitcoin to suddenly jump. The first is that $100 million worth of BTC was bought across exchanges Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp by one person. A sudden pump of money into the market spurred on further bullish sentiment, and the gains have continued. >> How Cryptocurrency Traders Benefit from Blockchain Technology Another theory is that because Bitcoin mining rewards will “half” in May of 2020, interest to buy BTC has sparked. The idea is to accumulate it now for the future when Bitcoin will be harder to mine and therefore become more scarce. As with any product, when it becomes more scarce, it becomes even more valuable. When mining rewards do halve in 2020, Bitcoin price can be expected to jump. So far in Bitcoin’s history ‘Halving’ has occurred twice–once in 2012 and once in 2016. What do you think? Do you have you a theory for the recent bull run? Featured Image: DepositImages © AntonMatyukha",10-Apr,2019
" Cryptocurrency investment is on the rise right now, especially due to the recent Bitcoin uptick. BTC’s recent climb attracted Chinese investors, but they’re paying a premium price because they have to pay extra to purchase over the counter. China previously banned cryptocurrency exchanges from operating within its borders and also banned crypto trading. However, Chinese crypto investors have been using OTC platforms to access the cryptocurrency markets. The downside is that they have to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at a higher price than the officially listed market value. Some of the OTC platforms include Huobi and OKEx, among others. The recent surge in the price of Bitcoin seems to have revived the cryptocurrency investment appetite of Chinese investors, who have kept off the market for quite some time during the lengthy bear market. The return of Chinese investors to the Bitcoin investment scene has led to speculation that they had something to do with the surge. A cryptocurrency researcher called Anton Pagi stated that the Bitcoin surge happened after a notable uptick in trading volume on exchanges that have been associated with Chinese traders. Pagi even referred to a data analysis chart provided by CoinLib, a data analysis provider. The chart showed that there was a large Chinese fiat investment into Bitcoin and other digital currencies. >> Cryptocurrency Witnesses Better Returns than Equities This Year A news outlet called cnLedger revealed that Chinese cryptocurrency investors have recommended a ‘strong buy’ rating on Bitcoin. It also reveals that Chinese investors are using over the counter platforms as their main avenue of purchasing cryptocurrencies. Chinese investors are reportedly so confident about their bullish approach that they are willing to purchase cryptocurrencies at premium prices. There is a high likelihood that the average bullish outlook and premium Bitcoin purchases are behind the recent surge in Bitcoin prices. Chinese investors have thus been positioning themselves to take advantage of the bullish market. Featured image: Pixabay",9-Apr,2019
" It’s a bullish day in the cryptosphere. Paypal makes a blockchain investment and Bitcoin jumps above $5,079 USD. Bitcoin gained 21% in early trade and has now slightly corrected back down to $4,712 according to CoinMarketCap. However, no one knows why the Bitcoin jump happened in the first place. Now, some investors wonder if the rally was the result of some sort of April Fool’s joke. Zhao Changpeng, the chief executive officer of Binance, tweeted earlier today that he was “clueless” about what may have triggered Bitcoin’s jump. Packing on over $600 in one night, the last time Bitcoin hit levels like this was in November. The top cryptocurrency plunged more than 70% in 2018 and has been stagnating through most of 2019 thus far. This period has been dubbed the “crypto winter,” and while today’s rally is impressive, analysts believe that “the bounce is not enough to reset crypto winter.” According to Julien Auchecorne, London-based chief operating officer at XBTO International: “we have no major new products and last year’s big breakthroughs are still in their nascent stage.” For Bitcoin’s jump to sustain itself, then bulls should hope for a bigger fundamental reason for the coin to climb. Elsewhere in the blockchain industry, payment giant PayPal has made its first blockchain investment debut. >> Bitcoin Price Jumps 20% on Technical Breakout: More Coins Follow Announced today, PayPal has joined a Series A funding round for Cambridge Blockchain, a startup that helps financial institutions and other companies manage sensitive data using shared ledgers. The investment amount has not been disclosed but what is known thus far is that Cambridge Blockchain has so far raised a total of $3.5 million in new equity. The firm has several investors who have backed it over the past nine months. So far, the blockchain startup has raised a total capital of $10.5 million. This is the first investment PayPal has put into a blockchain company. The move may help to encourage greater adoption of blockchain technology and its relevant assets. Between the massive Bitcoin jump and PayPal’s blockchain investment, there is good news all round in the cryptocurrency industry today! Featured Image: Pixabay",2-Apr,2019
" Twitter and Square founder Jack Dorsey has always been bullish in his Bitcoin views. So it’s no surprise that his payments startup Square is now offering new employees the chance to be paid in Bitcoin. According to tweets from the CEO, the company is on the hunt for skilled labor to add to the team. If Dorsey’s tweets are anything to go by, then the company is hiring engineers and a designer to “work full-time on open source contributions to the bitcoin/crypto ecosystem.”  The Square cash app already supports Bitcoin purchases and sales so it is intriguing to think of what these new hires may be working on.  But beyond that tweet, information is scarce. However, what is notable, is that these new hires will be able to be paid in Bitcoin if they so choose. It makes sense that Square would offer this option, Dorsey being a major advocate of cryptocurrency, earning himself the nickname Bitcoin Evangelist. His belief is that Bitcoin should become the world’s single native currency and using it is moving forward. >> Polymath Partners with SeriesOne for Security Token Issuance Dorsey added in a separate Tweet that “the most impactful thing” his company can do is to build upon the current cryptocurrency ecosystem. And this is one way it can give back to the community. He commented: “Square has taken a lot from the open source community to get us here. We haven’t given enough back. This is a small way to give back, and one that’s aligned with our broader interests: a more accessible global financial system for the internet.” Dorsey recently spoke in a podcast about the Square app saying how payment apps like it are the future for cryptocurrency: “We’re empowering the electrician to send invoices, setting up the food truck with a delivery option, helping the clothing boutique pay its employees, and giving the coffee chain capital for a second, third, and fourth location.” What do you think? Would you like a job working for Square? Featured Image: DepositPhotos © sdecoret",21-Mar,2019
" Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has spoken out about Bitcoin in a revelation that many would consider bullish in sentiment. Wozniak, in an interview with Bloomberg, has said of the coin that “we’ve seen massive value creation.”  He also puts most of the market volatility down to fear-mongering and psychology. The co-founder of Apple has always spoken highly of the coin and once said it would become the world’s single currency. The interviewer challenged him on this view asking him if he still had the same opinion considering “we’ve seen massive value destruction in Bitcoin.” But to that question, Steve Wozniak remained as bullish as ever about Bitcoin by saying: “I’m not sure I can buy that we’ve seen massive value destruction, I think we’ve seen massive value creation.” The tech icon has owned Bitcoin in the past. In the interview, he elaborates on this saying that he only kept it to experiment with and to experience the coins development, not for profit or typical investment reasons. He explains how he sold it when the price got really high: “I don’t want to be one of those people watching the price of Bitcoin, so I sold out.”  ",27-Feb,2019
" JPMorgan analysts are taking jabs at Bitcoin once more. The executives at this major US bank have never been fond of digital currency and blockchain technology. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s CEO, temporarily pulled back on his comments when BTC hit its all-time highs. Shortly after, the coin began to crash, and his skepticism picked up again. According to a Bloomberg report, the bank’s analysts say that it costs more to create one Bitcoin than it’s worth. In Q4 2018, it cost around $4,060 to mine one BTC and currently, the price of the digital currency is $3,584.07. Not all miners are paying that top dollar to mine though. Low-cost Chinese miners can pay much less, mining at around $2,400. Natasha Keneva was one of the JPMorgan analysts that released their cryptocurrency report to major news outlets. She claims that these low-cost miners leverage direct purchasing agreements with electricity generators that are looking to sell excess power. On top of the price, the bank as a whole believes that the true value of digital currencies like BTC is still unproven. The analyst said: “Even in extreme scenarios such as a recession or financial crises, there are more liquid and less-complicated instruments for transacting, investing and hedging.” >> Binance Launches OTC Trading Desk, Following Bittrex The cryptocurrency market has been steadily awaiting the flood of Wall Street investments that haven’t occurred on a large-scale like some would have hoped. Bitcoin futures, OTC trading desks, and the hope of Bitcoin ETFs were made to entice pension funds and asset managers, but none have budged. The prices of digital currencies rose towards the end of December but have quickly corrected, and all gains are almost lost once more. The JPMorgan analysts say that marketplaces, where individuals and small businesses have control over payment methods, would be the most useful for the spread of digital currencies. However, these analysts feel its volatility, propensity for illicit use, and security flaws should all be considered. Featured Image: Depositphotos © eivanov

" Bitcoin price is showing resilience in the face of adversity. The latest bad news has failed to knock BTC to the floor. So is there a bull run ahead? Yesterday, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) BZX equity exchange withdrew its request to list a Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund). The news surely has disappointed Bitcoin traders, but it has yet to be reflected in Bitcoin price. CBOE requested a rule change by the US SEC that would have allowed a Bitcoin ETF listing to be plausible. This potential ETF was backed by VanEck and SolidX. At the time of writing, BTC is selling for $3,606 USD and down by a slight -0.24% according to CoinMarketCap. But this could be far worse considering the negative climate, if the history of the coin is anything to go by. The cryptocurrency market has been eagerly anticipating a Bitcoin ETF for some time now. Approval for one would not only give the coin increased legitimacy in the eyes of governmental and financial bodies, but it would more than likely trigger a massive bull run. To date, applications for a Bitcoin ETF have been sent in and rejected by the SEC in their droves. These have included applications from the Gemini exchange, Bitwise, Proshares, and Direxion, to name only a few. Rejection tends to reflect negatively on the market and on Bitcoin price in particular, which usually decreases steeply on the news. >> John McAfee Will Run His Presidential Campaign Overseas It is interesting to note that today’s rejection is barely affecting Bitcoin price. BTC continues to trade in a sideways manner above $3,500 as it has done all week. The calm response to the bearish news may simply be market exhaustion. It could also be that this ETF approval was never really expected anyway considering the ETF history. Perhaps the blow was almost anticipated anyway. Either way, some analysts are predicting a bull run ahead as investors choose to stay calm over the news rather than panic. Featured Image: Depositphotos © Paulpaladin",24-Jan,2019
" According to a Russian economist with ties to the Kremlin, the superpower is preparing a massive $10 billion USD investment in Bitcoin to replace its US dollar reserves. Russia’s Bitcoin investment is a step to minimize US sanctions on the country. Vladislav Ginko, an economist at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, said the Bitcoin investment was a step taken to avoid US sanctions on Russia. Ginko believes that Russia’s decision to hold Bitcoin as a reserve currency instead of the US dollar is a move being made to “protect [Russia’s] national interests” in light of a possible interruption of “US nominated payments flows for Russian oil and gas.” Russia’s Bitcoin investment is expected to begin in February. Mr. Ginko furthered: “[The] Russian government is about to make a step to start diversifying financial reserves into Bitcoin since Russia [is] forced by US sanctions to dump US Treasury bonds and [take] back US dollars […]These sanctions and the will to adopt modern financial technologies lead Russia to the way of investing its reserves into Bitcoin.” US sanctions have hit the Russian rouble hard. Now the superpower wants to replace some of its US dollar reserves with the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap. >> Are Stablecoins the Future? The Winklevoss Twins Seem to Think So! Recent US sanctions on Russia came after the poisoning of former Russian military officer Sergei Skripal in London. The former Russian military officer was a double agent for the UK’s Intelligent Services. Two active Russian military intelligent officers attacked Sergei and his daughter Yulia, with a nerve agent. Cryptocurrencies are very popular in Russia and even receive approval by the country’s President Vladimir Putin. According to Ginko, the cryptocurrency industry accounts for 8% of Russia’s GDP. The Bitcoin investment is not the only sign of ‘de-dollarisation’ by the country. It has recently bolstered its supply of the euro, Chinese renminbi, and Japanese yen.

" According to a US Government SEC registration form, cryptocurrency index fund provider Bitwise Asset Management has applied to launch a new Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) with the government body. An ETF is a platform that tracks and trades an asset in the same way as stocks are traded on an exchange. Will Bitwise manage to succeed where so many others are failing? Bitwise’s proposal is for an ETF that tracks the value of Bitcoin via the Bitwise Bitcoin Total Return Index. This value is “calculated based on the prices of Bitcoin that the Index Provider derives from Bitcoin price transactions occurring on cryptocurrency exchanges.” Basically, the index will take Bitcoin’s value from a variety of crypto exchanges and will, therefore, offer a more accurate and precise market value for the coin. This is one difference that Bitwise’s ETF proposal offers that previous ETF proposals—which have all been rejected—did not. Another difference on offer with Bitwise’s ETF proposal is that it would need “regulated third-party custodians to hold its physical bitcoin.” The company’s Global Head of ETFs, John Hyland, spoke of this in the press release: “Having a regulated bank or trust company hold physical assets of a fund has been the standard under US fund regulation for the last 80 years, and we believe that is now possible with Bitcoin.” >> Ethereum Classic Attack: Gate.io Will Return Most Funds Bitwise is still awaiting a decision from the SEC on a previously filed ETF that would track the Bitwise HOLD 10 Private Index Fund. The approval of a crypto ETF has yet to happen, although the industry has been crying out for one. In December 2018, the SEC postponed its decision on a Bitcoin ETF by investment firm VanEck and blockchain company SolidX. It is now expected to make a decision by the end of February.

" Charlie Lee is at it again. The Litecoin founder isn’t shy when it comes to voicing his opinion on crypto via Twitter and yesterday was no different. It seems this time, he’s targeting Bitcoin maximalists. It all started with a poll. Some self-proclaimed Bitcoin Maximalists are actually Bitcoin Extremists. They think all other coins are scams and will go to zero. Maximalists think Bitcoin is and will remain the dominant cryptocurrency but there is room for altcoins to exist and even do well. What are you? — Charlie Lee [LTC⚡] (@SatoshiLite) January 6, 2019  It seems Mr. Lee isn’t happy with a group of self-proclaimed Bitcoin maximalists. The Litecoin founder goes even as far as calling them “extremists,” which isn’t generally a positive thing to call someone. In 23 hours, Charlie Lee has collected over 28,000 votes on his poll and Bitcoin maximalist has taken over the majority of it. At press time, Bitcoin extremist has 9%, altcoin maximalist has 33%, and nocoiner has 10%. That leaves the remaining 48% to individuals who deem themselves Bitcoin maximalists. Traditionally, maximalists believe that Bitcoin (BTC) is the top cryptocurrency and the one to use day-to-day. Where Lee seems upset is that a group of these maximalists have attacked his own project and feel there is no space for any altcoins in the industry. This is what prompted the Twitter poll and attack on these so-called “extremists.” Others had their own take on the poll and subject, as usual. ""Supremacists"" has a more negative connotation… In recent years, ""extremists"" has been used more and more to simply mean ""someone who actually believes what they say they do"". — Luke Dashjr (@LukeDashjr) January 7, 2019  Another person actually knocking Litecoin said: I've always thought you seemed like a super good person and for a time I accumulated LTC. That being said I sold all my LTC this year for Bitcoin, and that was not out of ideology. It was a selfish, financial calculation I made because I don't see an enduring reason for LTC. — John Fever [sold BCH at $6K] (@ProgrammableTx) January 6, 2019  Not sure why the person above bought Litecoin because they thought Charlie Lee was a “good person” but that’s probably someone that shouldn’t be investing—just my opinion. Binance’s CEO even joined into the conversation. >> Monero “Mistake”—Now You Can’t Pay for Fortnite Merch with Monero Will be interesting to see how this plays out. But I believe in thousands of blockchain sand millions of tokens. Freedom implies choice. — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) January 7, 2019  From all the rest of the conversation via the initial tweet, it seems Lee isn’t the one who made up the term Bitcoin maximalists. He took that from Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder. It remains unclear why Bitcoin (BTC) supporters need to be placed into a category, but the altcoin leaders, like Charlie Lee, obviously feel it’s necessary. According to CoinMarketCap, BTC broke over the $4,00 threshold recently and is currently trading at $4,044.75 a coin, down – $0.97%, in 24 hours. Featured Image: Depositphotos © GekaSkr

" Crypto players from around the globe are chiming in on the direction of the Bitcoin price in 2019. Will it continue to see price crashes? Or will the current recovery continue? Better yet, has the industry had a good year and will it continue to have significance in the new year? Earlier in the week, we heard from bears, like Erik Finman who called Bitcoin “dead;” and we heard from Spencer Bogart, a Bitcoin bull, who not only said BTC will continue to rise, but that 2018, contrary to popular belief, has been one of the best years for the cryptocurrency.  Today, word surfaced that the President of Coinbase, Asiff Hirji, believes something similar to Bogart. Despite the crashes experienced in 2018 (such as the bearish run that sent the Bitcoin price to a low of $3,200), Asiff Hirji believes BTC is recovering.  In his interview with CNBC’s Fast Money, Hirji said this recovery isn’t surprising and that it’s likely to continue into 2019. That’s a statement in complete opposition of the thoughts of Erik Finman. “Some things are never as good as they seem,” said the Coinbase President, “and never as bad as they seem.” Bitcoin soaring this week as the markets selloff. Here's what @coinbase president @asiffhirji had to say about the move pic.twitter.com/dCrXkhq5bz — CNBC's Fast Money (@CNBCFastMoney) December 20, 2018  During the interview, Hirji spoke on the performance of the crypto market in the last year. According to Hirji, there’s been more innovation this year in the market. “We’ve never had as much innovation as we have today,” Hirji explained, citing, for instance, how cryptocurrencies are getting more visible. >> Facebook Cryptocurrency: Is the Tech Giant Developing a Stablecoin? Spencer Bogart, also during a Fast Money interview, spoke on something similar, calling 2018 a “fantastic year” for BTC, despite the Bitcoin price crashes. Speaking also on innovation, Bogart said this year is the first time we have scaled the digital currency “with a lightening network,” making transactions quick and cheap. At the time of writing, the BTC price is $3,905.13. It’s vital to take comments such as Asiff Hirji’s into consideration. While it’s easy to oust BTC from your mind due to the recent Bitcoin price crashes, we must also recognize the good that occurred during the year, such as an increase in innovation.

" Despite Bitcoin’s intense price drop in recent months, some still believe it is going to turn it around next year. And there’s nothing to say it definitely won’t; in the last three days, Bitcoin has packed on 18% in gains. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap jumped from $3,181 to $3,776 in under three days, proving further that nobody can truly know where this coin is headed next. One advocate for its future upturn is Mike Kayamori, CEO of Quinone, a Japan-based crypto exchange platform. Speaking with Bloomberg TV, Kayamori believes that by the end of 2019, Bitcoin won’t just have increased its price, but it will hit a new all-time high. Is he just being hopeful or is there anything to back this up? The future can always appear promising, but 2018 has been anything but for Bitcoin. The crypto market has been truly bearish all year, wiping 80% of its value off the board since January. Bitcoin was priced at around $20,000 this time last year; now it is struggling to stay above $3,000. There have been some brief bullish runs here and there, but overall, Bitcoin has been on a steady downward spiral for most of the year. It doesn’t help that it’s taken most altcoins with it. >> Spencer Bogart: Bitcoin Price Can Go Lower or Higher, Either Way It’s a Good Asset But for Kayamori, the reason for the current state of Bitcoin is simply a lack of newness in the crypto market. Believing that “there’s nothing new, no catalyst” to propel the market forward, he could be right. Cryptocurrencies grew their value from hype, after all, and there has been very little newness to continue the momentum. But what is new in Kayamori’s opinion is that Japanese exchanges are adapting to Japan’s regulations and the country is open to more industry players. This, he thinks, will help to spur on adoption, at least in Japan anyway. The CEO also went on to say that the arrival of Fidelity Digital Asset Services by Bakkt, as well as other investor-focused products in early 2019, will give “new momentum and sentiment” and could drive a bullish Bitcoin rebound.

" As we wrap up 2018, crypto players are starting to publicly come out with their Bitcoin price forecasts for the new year. Some are bearish, using the fact that BTC was nearing $20 thousand this time last year. Others, however, continue to be bullish. Spencer Bogart of Bitcoin Capital is one of the latter. In a recent interview with CNBC, when asked whether he believes BTC will hit $50,000, Spencer Bogart said yes, but maybe not as soon as bulls are forecasting.  “Absolutely it can go that high,” said Bogart, “how long will it take, I’m not sure.” That’s a different but realistic approach to the future of Bitcoin price, compared to someone like Tom Lee, who reiterated his $15 thousand year-end prediction last month. The crypto market is aware of the downward tumble in the Bitcoin price. However, players remain divided as to what the cause of it was. Was it because Bitcoin was never meant to succeed? Just another Ponzi scheme? Bears may agree. Or, was it because of the individual players buying the digital currency, not being mature enough to learn the ropes before climbing up them? For Spencer Bogart, co-founder of Bitcoin Capital, he is of no opinion. He is simply ignoring the BTC price. Bogart said that if you ignore it, it becomes evident that 2018 has been a “fantastic year” for the digital currency. “This is the first year we have started to move to scale Bitcoin with a lightening network where you can transact extremely quickly and extremely cheaply,” explained Bogart. >> Has Tether Told the Truth All Along? Bank Statements Say 1 For 1 In the CNBC interview, Bogart said: “I think it’s a great buy in opportunity right now.” Does he deny that Bitcoin will probably drop lower? No; “Could we go lower?” Bogart asked, “absolutely.” But that’s what makes it such a great opportunity. “I think anywhere between here and $2,000 and $1,000 is a great buy in opportunity.”  He added that in 24 months, people may look back and say “why didn’t I buy now?” The interviewer didn’t seem to support the idea as much, jokingly responding back saying “I hope so. I hope it’s not more of a question of why did I buy then?” Some people are worried about the Bitcoin price lingering around $3,000, but Spencer Bogart is not one of them. Everyone is different, though. What direction do you think BTC is headed in for the new year? Let us know in the comments below. Featured Image: Depositphotos/ulchik74",18-Dec,2018
" In 2017, the Bitcoin price shot up. The crypto boom was in its prime and BTC, in particular, saw a rise, especially in the second half of December. When this happened, there was a rush to buy the cryptocurrency; then there was a crash. One year later, the BTC price is nowhere near where it was in December 2017.  However, even though we have more Bitcoin bears emerging from the forest, there is some indication that BTC is the same asset and will continue to provide investors with the same shots. In December of 2017, Bitcoin price was flying and almost reached a whopping $20,000. Fast forward a year, things are looking a little different.  At the time of writing, the BTC price is sitting at $3,587.05. Despite the visible price changes in Bitcoin, the crypto market remains divided. There are bears, like Erik Finman, and there are bulls, like Tom Lee, who has maintained his end-of-year outlook, despite the falling market. This week, MarketWatch published an interview with Erik Finman, a teenage Bitcoin millionaire. Going from a 12-year-old who purchased Bitcoin with $1,000 from his grandmother, Finman is now bearish on the digital currency. >> EOS, Litecoin (LTC), and Cardano (ADA) Get a Boost! “Bitcoin is dead,” explained Finman in the interview. “It may have a bull market or two left in it, but long-term, it’s dead.” Not everyone feels this way, though.  Tom Lee, a long-standing crypto bull, announced back in November that he still believes the Bitcoin price will reach $15,000 by the end of 2018. Meanwhile, Matti Greenspan, an eToro senior analyst, thinks Bitcoin may make a comeback. Greenspan also believes the digital currency’s price fluctuations over the last year have no reflection on BTC’s long-term interest. Perhaps one of the most intriguing comments comes from Clement Thibault, an Investing.com senior analyst. Describing the Bitcoin bubble experienced in 2017, Thibault says it was the result of “human greed and short-term thinking.” Thibault adds that BTC hasn’t changed “and it remains the same asset, whether it’s $20,000 or $3,000.” Both the Bitcoin bulls and bears make valid points. Just like with other markets, however, only time will tell the direction that Bitcoin price takes in 2019. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© muratani",17-Dec,2018
" Bitcoin price is tumbling further today, dashing any hopes of a rally that some felt was certain thanks to current extreme oversold conditions. The world’s largest coin by market cap is currently selling for $3,301.60 USD according to coinmarketcap.com. But earlier today, it fell to $3,200, representing a 15-month low for Bitcoin and not helping bulls’ hopes for a revival. This is the lowest level since September 2017. In the last four weeks alone, Bitcoin has dropped 49% in price. Surely, sellers are exhausted, and Bitcoin is set to turn around. Earlier this week, BTC began moving upwards towards $3,633, but it did not last. The coin’s failure to produce a worthy bounce back despite being extremely oversold indicates that the bears are winning this war and negative sentiment is strong. A 200-week moving average support of $3,170 has been established and now heading below it may be a real possibility for Bitcoin. Across the market, the sentiment is once again bearish. Bitcoin Cash’s recent forks Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin Cash are both two of the biggest losers, with declines of approximately 11% and 14% respectively. It seems the hashrate war between these two coins is doing neither of them any favors. The hard fork happened on November 15th, and the contentious split has caused both coins to lose more than they have gained. Elsewhere, Stellar is down 7.5%, and EOS is down 5%. Ethereum is down 4.5%. >> You Can Earn Bitcoin (BTC) While Shopping with the Lolli App What’s causing the market-wide sell-off? Notably, investors are worried over the fate of a Bitcoin ETF gaining US approval in February. Also the uncertainty of whether or not (or when) this bear sentiment will end, leaves investors’ prospects for short-term Bitcoin price gains at a paltry level. However, some are calling this period one of the “best buying opportunities.” At its current prices, rating agency Weiss is a firm believer that Bitcoin will turn around and now is the time to buy.

" Do you shop frequently at Sephora? Lululemon? Walmart? If you do, a new in-browser app has emerged and wants to give you Bitcoin (BTC). CoinDesk just reported that the app called Lolli just added Sephora to their list of retailers. Lolli gives shoppers cash back after they make purchases at their list of partnered retailers. The Bitcoin rewards startup told CoinDesk that it recently won over Sephora by data. Around 30 percent of Lolli’s active users are women. “We’ve gone back to a lot of these retailers that previously were not interested but now are coming on-board,” Lolli CEO Alex Adelman told CoinDesk. “One of the biggest ones that just joined us is Sephora, which adds an entire suite of retailers in the beauty category.” Lolli is also partnered with Sephora’s biggest competitor, Ulta. These retailers pay Lolli for customer referrals in fiat currency, which in turn is converted into Bitcoin for rewards in the app. Many crypto-based startup companies have faced vast layoffs this year, due to the bear market. However, Lolli has only six employees and is gaining some traction. >> Crypto Users Increased to 35 Million in 2018: What Will 2019 Bring? Adelman told CoinDesk that Ulta is a huge retailer for the startup company. The tech CEO also claims that men and women alike were consistently requesting Sephora. To earn rewards on Sephora or Ulta, users just have to install the app in their Chrome browser and shop normally. So far, Adelman claims 60 percent of Lolli users become repeat shoppers. Lolli is currently partnered with 500+ popular retailers. You can earn Bitcoin (BTC) through Lolli by shopping online with these major retailers: Barnes & Noble, Overstock, FinishLine, Michaels, Toms, Macy’s, Walmart, CVS Pharmacy, Lululemon, Groupon, and VRBO. The Bitcoin startup was launched back in September of 2018, and it has raised $2.35 million so far. On average, Lolli pays out $10 per purchase in BTC.

" The world’s second-largest stock exchange in the world, the Nasdaq exchange, has officially confirmed its plans to launch Bitcoin futures in 2019. Late last week, unofficial reports surfaced of the exchange launching these plans, first reported by Bloomberg. Joseph Christinat, VP of Nasdaq’s media team, spoke to the UK’s daily tabloid The Express yesterday and confirmed the plans. The VP states that these futures will be listed and launched in the first half of 2019—no official date has been given at this time. The launch still remains subject to approval from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Christinat told The Express: “We’ve put a hell of a lot of money and energy into delivering the ability to do this and we’ve been all over it for a long time—way before the market went into turmoil, and that will not affect the timing of this in any way. No. Period. We’re doing this no matter what.” This is a positive announcement for crypto enthusiasts. Most crypto-related projects that sprouted up in 2017 were knee-jerk reactions to what was hot in the market. This, however, seems like a thoroughly thought out plan that has been brewing for a while. Joseph Christinat’s interview did not confirm whether Nasdaq’s Bitcoin futures will be cash-backed or physically settled. Bakkt will be launching the first physically delivered Bitcoin futures in this coming January. Cash-settled Bitcoin futures came into the market in December of 2017 by the CBOE and CME Group. >> CVS Health, Aetna, UnitedHealth Group, and Humana Trial Blockchain Technology for Healthcare Back in November 2017, Nasdaq announced the target launch of their Bitcoin futures to be by mid-2018. Their plans hit a snag when Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies began tumbling in the first half of 2018. These plans were pushed back to create a “unique enough” offering to the market. According to CoinMarketCap, BTC is currently trading at $4,029.40 a coin, up 1.34%, in 24 hours. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© koydesign",4-Dec,2018
" Bitcoin (BTC) made a rather dramatic comeback just 48 hours ago. At press time, the world’s first digital currency is currently trading above $4,300. The entire crypto community is buzzing, as most altcoins have followed BTC’s upward movements. The cryptocurrency community took a huge hit in mid-November when Bitcoin Cash miners started a hash war. Investors lost confidence in the maturity of the community, as the war dragged out after Bitcoin Cash split in two. On one side was Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com, who led the Bitcoin ABC movement. On the other was Craig Wright, also known as ‘Faketoshi’ by the crypto community, who led Bitcoin SV. Very much like the split of the Ethereum blockchain with Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Cash was split into Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin ABC. During that mess, Bitcoin (BTC) and most altcoins began to plummet. While the Bitcoin Cash mess hasn’t fully cleared, it seems investors have gained their confidence back in crypto once more. There has been a lot of crypto-positive news that has debuted this morning—which should boost investor confidence even further. Ohio becomes the first state to allow businesses to pay taxes with Bitcoin https://t.co/iGo7RtHri2 pic.twitter.com/rhKBHzoqzO — CNN Business (@CNNBusiness) November 29, 2018  As for the news in the tweet above, it remains unclear how many businesses will actually use this means of paying taxes, but it is a positive movement for the crypto community. Perhaps the biggest Bitcoin news of the day came from the Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Yesterday, at the Consensus conference, Jeff Sprecher was asked, “Will digital assets survive?” “The unequivocal answer is yes,” Sprecher replied. “As an exchange operator it’s not our objective to opine on prices.” He went on to explain that there are thousands of digital tokens out there that can be argued are ‘better’ than Bitcoin, and yet it continues to survive and gain mainstream attention. Sprecher continued: “Often times in finance, it’s not about being the best—it turns out to be about being the broadest and the most commonly accepted and for whatever reason bitcoin has become that.” >> Will Bitcoin (BTC) Hit $15,000 Again?

" Many in the financial world this week were claiming Bitcoin was “dead” after it hit its 2018 record lows this week. What they didn’t predict was a Bitcoin rally. On Sunday, the world’s first digital currency hit just above $3,600 a coin, which is the coin’s record-low this year. Bitcoin hadn’t seen below $3,700 since mid-September 2017, and this past week, the cryptocurrency was down almost -40% for the month. However, on Tuesday night that all began to shift. In around 60 minutes, Bitcoin jumped up in price over $200. While this isn’t the monumental rise it had on a daily basis in late-2017, the jump shows a positive trend. Major sells-offs began when the miners behind Bitcoin Cash started a civil war. The digital currency was set for its semi-annual upgrade and was split into two competing digital currencies after its hard fork. There were other contributing factors to the sell-offs, but the hash war exposed the immaturity of these projects and lost a lot of investor trust. What may have spiked the Bitcoin rally last night was the recently released news of Nasdaq still planning to launch its own Bitcoin futures in the first quarter of 2019. This step could bring more institutional investors into the playing field, without them needing to actually buy the digital currency. Many investors have been patiently waiting for Bitcoin ETFs to roll out, but Jay Clayton, the Executive Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has yet to confirm the decision. >> ADAM will Set a Code of Conduct for Crypto Participants “What investors expect is that the trading in that commodity that’s underlying the ETF is trading that makes sense, is free from the risk or significant risk of manipulation,” Clayton reportedly told the Consensus Invest Conference in Manhattan. “Those kinds of safeguards don’t exist in many of the markets where digital currencies trade.” The SEC is expected to announce its decision in late December. If approved, investors would be able to buy into Bitcoin without having to deal with cryptocurrency exchanges. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $4,202.51 a coin, up 12.71%, in 24 hours. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Syda_Productions",28-Nov,2018
" Nasdaq Inc. is still planning to launch its Bitcoin futures early next year, Bloomberg reported early this morning. Two individuals familiar with the Bitcoin project told Benjamin Bain, a reporter at Bloomberg, that despite the downturned market the index still plans on offering these contracts. Bitcoin (BTC) has plunged nearly -75% since the beginning of the year and interest in digital currencies has dramatically decreased. Still, the Wall Street exchange feels there is enough investor interest to continue its plans. One of the individuals at Nasdaq told Bloomberg that the company has been working diligently to satisfy the concerns of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission before launch. The first Bitcoin futures were launched mid-December 2017 by the CME Group Inc. and CBOE Global Markets Inc. Bitcoin (BTC) saw its record high of nearly $20,000 a coin after the first set of Bitcoin futures were launched. At press time, BTC is currently trading at just over $3,700. In December, many thought that these future contracts would usher in a new wave of investment from Wall Street investors, but the fall of digital currencies in 2018 proves that wasn’t the case. >> Bitcoin Cash Hash War: Who Won? Nasdaq hopes to launch its Bitcoin futures in Q1 2019. The futures offered in January will be based off Bitcoin’s price on numerous spot exchanges, said Nasdaq.com CEO Adena Friedman. The figures will be compiled by VenEck Associates Corp. The CME uses prices from four different markets, while the CBOE uses just one. Nasdaq isn’t the only impending Bitcoin derivative though. The New York Stock Exchange owner, Intercontinental Exchange Inc., plans on launching its contracts in late January 2019. There has yet to be an official announcement from Nasdaq Inc., and the reports published by Bloomberg seem to be from unofficial sources. The major exchange could still pull the plug on its plans on Bitcoin futures, especially if Bitcoin (BTC) continues to drop. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© konstantin32",27-Nov,2018
" Back in 2017, Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency took the spotlight in the media as investors and Wall Street began to take notice of digital currencies and the blockchain. Many executives in the major global banks shot down digital currencies almost immediately, as Bitcoin was a direct threat to their existence. See, Bitcoin was created to expose the currently flawed central banking system and to completely revamp the way individuals spend and send money. It remains unknown why crypto began to pick up speed towards the second half of 2017, but at the time, some digital currencies were seeing 100% gains in a single day. Cryptocurrency mining began to pick up as well, which became an extremely lucrative business at the time. Many businesses began completely changing their business models and centering them around digital token mining. Unfortunately, the equipment to ‘mine’ isn’t cheap. The process of generating new units of cryptocurrency by solving complex puzzles can often be expensive, due to the vast amounts of electricity that is needed. This doesn’t even include the hardware required. In January of 2018, no one predicted the fall of BTC and the rest of the crypto market. In 30 days, $500 billion was wiped off of the market. So, when Bitcoin’s price dropped, BTC mining was no longer economically viable. So what happens to those businesses that invested all that money into mining equipment and state-of-the-art mining facilities? Well, they run out of money. So far, the biggest casualty from the fall of digital currencies comes from the US-based mining firm Giga Watt. The company was forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after it was unable to pay its debts of around $7 million USD. >> Bitcoin’s Fall from Grace: Warren Buffett Said It All Along A large number of the world’s mining operations reside in China, and countless mining businesses have been forced to shut their doors.

" Talk of the crypto-town is Bitcoin’s massive fall from grace. It seemed to be holding steady at around $6,300/$6,400 for most of October, but now it’s holding on for dear life. Mid-November saw the coin drop unprecedentedly. It began crashing and continues to today. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is priced at $4,2oo per coin and down a further 4% on the day. Some will blame Bitcoin Cash’s hard fork for creating an industry scare. Some will blame talk of regulatory scrutiny for rattling investors. But others will say, “I told you so” that Bitcoin’s crash was an inevitable eventuality and neither of the above possibilities could ever be a real reason for its fall. One such skeptic is Warren Buffett, who never bit the cryptocurrency line. He has continually spoken out against digital assets, maintaining “almost with certainty, that they will come to a bad ending.” Many people have lauded his type for his ‘outdated’ thinking; the world’s wealthiest investor who made his fortune playing the stock market was always going to dismiss cryptocurrency. Of course he was. But weren’t his concerns even partly founded? Bitcoin price has been decided by market speculation. It’s that simple really. And, for some, ‘speculation,’ means a mixed bag of exaggerations, lies, ideologies, and empty promises. It was this speculation that drove the market mania of last year. It was in 2017 that Bitcoin surged to the heights of almost $20,000 USD per coin. But like everything in this world, hype is usually met with an inevitable fall from grace. >> Colorado ICOs: Regulators Stop Another 18 ICOs Isn’t that really what Bitcoin is? A new technology that was hyped up to ‘replace’ the unfair and dated practices of our modern financial sector? If you were lucky enough to get in early before the hype, then you may have made yourself a pretty penny off of it. For everyone else, the idea of simply getting rich off of Bitcoin is nothing but a fantasy. The idea that any kind of financial platform couldn’t come with corruption and controversy is a pipe dream. So was Warren Buffett always right? Is this the beginning of the “bad end” for cryptocurrencies? Where Bitcoin goes, others tend to follow, and as it stands, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has fallen to around $138.6 billion since January 2018. This is a remarkable fall of 80%. Even more remarkable is that figure translates to almost $700 billion USD. Who’s getting rich now? *Mic Drop* Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Gesrey",23-Nov,2018
" Tom Lee, the long-standing Wall Street crypto bull, is sticking to his $15,000 year-end price prediction for Bitcoin (BTC). The Fundstrat Global Advisor voiced his prediction on CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ yesterday. Bitcoin just recently fell to its lowest levels in more than a year yesterday, but Lee remains convinced. Originally, Lee cut his Bitcoin year-end prediction by $10,000—from $25,000 to $15,000. “Days like this, it does make me wonder,” said Lee to CNBC. “These past few days have definitely been a negative development.” The Fundstrat advisor contends that more oversight from US regulators and institutional involvement could push the prices of BTC up. Lee told CNBC that the upcoming launch of Bakkt, the digital assets platform run by the New York Stock Exchange, could peak investor interest as it is set to launch at the end of January 2019. Often, digital currencies see a ‘boost’ during a run-up to a major product launch. >> Bakkt Looks for Support for Its Next Futures Contract Elaborating more on his US regulation comment, Lee explained: “Once we have that [regulatory clarity], I think, institutions will feel more comfortable in making bets.” Lee isn’t the only one that remains bullish on cryptocurrency. Just recently, the Netherlands-based KPMG released another bull report on cryptocurrency. From its peak in early January 2018, the total cryptocurrency market has fallen over $600 billion USD. Uneducated investors flooded the cryptocurrency market around Thanksgiving of last year when the market remained consistently green for nearly 6-8 weeks. Around Christmas, the market took a stagnant turn, only to hit its record peak in the first week of January. When the market corrected after its peak, new crypto investors began panic selling. Many educated investors know correction in any market is inevitable, but those new to investing did not. Thus, the widespread dump of cryptocurrencies. Now, only those that truly believe in the power of Bitcoin and the blockchain remain! Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Elnur_",21-Nov,2018
" Bitcoin has hit its lowest level again this year. Is it the beginning of the end for Bitcoin? I bet that question has been asked many times over in 2018. Bitcoin gained house-hold name status around Thanksgiving last year. That was the kind of year Bitcoin had in 2017. But now, Bitcoin is down more than 30% since Thanksgiving 2017. But that’s not as bad as being down 60% on the year, 18% this week alone, and hitting the lowest level of 2018 today. At the time of writing, BTC is selling for $5,148 and is down nearly 9% on the day. As is the industry standard, Bitcoin tends to lead the pack; other major cryptocurrencies are down, with Ethereum and Ripple losing over 12% and 4.5% respectively. In fact, this loss is so significant for Ethereum that Ripple has just overtaken it in terms of market cap. Now Ripple is the second most valuable cryptocurrency in the world. Ethereum is third. All in a week’s work. Bitcoin’s lowest level came unexpectedly—BTC had remained around the $6,400 range for most of October despite the rest of the global markets going through sell-offs. It was around this time last year when Bitcoin began its epic rise, first topping $10,000 at the end of November and was worth almost $20,000 per coin by Christmas. The CBOE brought in the first Bitcoin futures trading platform on December 10th, but prices hit their peak the same day the CME began Bitcoin futures trading on December 17th. The futures market gave investors the ability to bet on the decline of Bitcoin price. It was the ultimate gambling platform—Bitcoin, with a value derived from speculation and nothing tangible, could now make investors even more money by betting on, effectively, market speculation. >> IDEX Lists Ride Sharing Company RedCab LLC’s REDC Token But today paints a different story. This past week has wiped approximately $40 billion off the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization. According to eToro analyst Mati Greenspan: “The next logical level of support is at $5,000 but if that doesn’t hold, the next logical support level isn’t until $3,500. With all the falling prices lately, this definitely fits the definition of a buyers market.” But do you think anyone is expecting Bitcoin to really kick off again? Do you think if you bought in now that the coin might repeat the good old days of 2017? Something tells me betting on its decline these days makes for an easier prediction.

" Today is a bleak day for cryptocurrencies everywhere as Bitcoin hits the lowest level of the year thus far. Where Bitcoin goes, the rest of the market tends to follow, and indeed, the index shows us all the top-ten coins are experiencing double-digit losses. Currently, Bitcoin is down over 10% and has touched a low of $5,550 a coin. This price is the weakest the coin has been since October 2017 and also puts an end to what was the steadiest period the coin experienced in months. Bitcoin has been trading comfortably around the $6,400 range for the majority of Autumn and volatility was at an all-time low. The market is placing the blame on tomorrow’s Bitcoin Cash hard fork for the selloff across the exchanges today. As stated, the damage is widespread, and Bitcoin Cash itself is suffering the hardest, with losses just shy of 17%. Ethereum is down -13.5% and Litecoin is down -13.05%, but the entire top-ten are hurting. The Bitcoin Cash hard fork will result in a network being split into two different versions of Bitcoin Cash. One upgrade will follow the Roger Ver-favored Bitcoin Cash ABC protocol, and the other will follow Craig Wright’s preferred protocol, the Bitcoin Cash SV. According to Mati Greenspan of eToro: “Both Roger and Craig are advocating a different version of Bitcoin Cash […] The end result will most likely be a split in the network resulting in two different versions of Bitcoin Cash when both upgrades go into effect this Thursday.” >> Japenese Crypto Exchange Coincheck Resumes NEM (XEM) Trade Ten Months Later The entire cryptocurrency market capitalization dropped by $15 billion USD over 24 hours Wednesday.

The release was far more colorful and interactive than most public companies’ earnings reports. It included various pie charts, graphs, and diagrams, uncommon in the earnings space. Earlier this year, the newly public company introduced Bitcoin support in its Square Cash payment app. Compared to Q2, cryptocurrency revenue grew $6 million in Q3. “Total net revenue was $882 million in the third quarter of 2018, up 51% year over year. This includes $43 million of bitcoin revenue,” the report reads. Square has been on the rise lately, as its market cap just passed Twitter’s this week. Coincidentally, Jack Dorsey is CEO of both companies. While media interest may be down in cryptocurrency this year, this earnings report shows that there is still interest in the crypto space. >> A Guide to Understanding Cryptocurrency White Papers Bitcoin profits remain a niche for Square, and the company only brought in profits of around $500,000 after taking into account Bitcoin purchasing costs. This past October, Square expanded its interaction by open sourcing its cold storage set up and expanding its crypto offerings in new jurisdictions. Square just recently launched Square Terminal, which allows merchants to take debit and credit card payments. There have been rumors circulating about the possible merchants’ integration with BTC, but there have yet to be any official reports on the matter. At press time, Bitcoin is currently trading at $6,515.40 a coin, down -0.11%.

" Bitcoin (BTC) futures hit record low volatility in October on the US Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), MarketWatch reported yesterday. Kevin Davitt, a Senior instructor at CBOE Options Institute, published a video on November 1st outlining the volatility decline.  In the video above, Davitt outlines that the average weekly volatility for XBT-CBOE Bitcoin (BTC) futures on the week ending October 26th was just three percent. This is the lowest level of volatility since the futures contracts launched on December 10th, 2017. As of the first of November, the average weekly XBT high-low range on front-month Bitcoin futures since inception is 15.65%. Since tax day, mid-April 2018, this weekly average had dropped to 10.6%. “As it turns out, [Bitcoin] XBT futures and cryptos in general are moving with very little speed. The week ending Oct. 26th was the least volatile since futures were introduced nearly a year ago,” Davitt told MarketWatch. This CBOE Bitcoin (BTC) futures news is a positive one for institutional investors wanting to get into the crypto space, as high volatility is the reason most have stayed away. Even major banks interested in launching their own crypto products have been hesitant due to the volatility and current low-demand for these products. >> Crypto Airdrops are Now Illegal in China Former L/S Equities portfolio manager, Travis Kling, pointed out: Over the last month, BTC and Crypto markets broadly have hung in INCREDIBLY well in the context of traditional asset class stress.

One would expect if investors on Wall Street are selling, the panic would have spread to crypto investors, but as seen in the chart above, crypto enthusiasts remained cool, calm, and collected.

" Global investment bank Morgan Stanley has given Bitcoin bulls something to cheers about. The institution has stated that it classes Bitcoin as an institutional investment class. (And the day after Bitcoin’s birthday… how thoughtful) What this means is that it recognizes Bitcoin as a type of asset similar to shares, property, bonds, cash, or commodities. It also means good news for those hoping for a Bitcoin ETF. The bank’s research division reviewed the last six months of Bitcoin usage. What the researchers discovered was that permanent ledger technologies, hacks, hard forks, Bitcoin competitors, and market volatility have led to a conclusion that the most sensible way to classify BTC is as an institutional investment class. The researchers concluded that Bitcoin is not just a digital payment system or financial network, but an asset class in its own right. According to Coindesk: “Perhaps most notably, the report emphasized its ‘rapidly morphing thesis,’ which began by defining bitcoin as ‘digital cash’ and noting that investors had full confidence in it, to a solution for issues in the financial system, to a new payment system to ultimately a new institutional investment class.” The report detailed further: “Various issues and discoveries around the bitcoin ecosystem have caused the thesis to evolve, including the permanent ledger recording all transactions, a number of hacks, hard forks, new technologies which are cheaper than bitcoin, market volatility and other concerns.” >> Jamie Dimon Knocks Down Bitcoin Again Bitcoin has evolved. At present, $7.11 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) is being stored by hedge funds or capital firms. This is somewhat hypocritical as the original whitepaper of Bitcoin looked to avoid involvement with financial institutions. But adoption by major financial institutions is increasing, and it only serves to support the coin as a legitimate asset.

" JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has always been tough when it comes to his stance on Bitcoin (BTC). Back in September of 2017, Dimon even went as far as calling it a “fraud.” He later retracted his statement and said that he was wrong for calling it a fraud but was still wary of the digital currency. Well, it seems Dimon has something different to say about Bitcoin now. Again. Two days ago at an AXIOS conference, the CEO was asked about changing his mind on Bitcoin, and he said, “I never changed what I said, I just regret having said it,” CNBC reported. Dimon continued by saying: “I didn’t want to be the spokesman against Bitcoin (BTC). I don’t really give a s*&^, that’s the point—okay? But Blockchain is real, it’s technology, Bitcoin is not the same as fiat currency.” Most major banking CEOs around the globe have taken a very similar stance on the matter. Nearly a year ago, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) CEO James Gordon stated that despite Bitcoin rising 700 percent in 2017, the digital currency was the definition of a “speculative investment and anyone thinking it might be stable is deluding themselves.” Gorman goes on to describe Bitcoin as “not even close to a safe investment.” >> Coinbase will Add Nearly 300 Coins in the Next Year but Won’t IPO Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is the exception among most major US banks. GS has been very pro digital currencies and is even recently rumored to have started onboarding some of its clients to sign up for its future crypto projects. There has yet to be an official statement from the bank on the matter, but the support shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, as the bank has been vocal about its crypto plans in the past. Despite the negative outlook on digital currency from Jamie Dimon and most of the major banks around the world, many of them  are working with some form of blockchain technology behind the scenes, to see if it can improve their day-to-day operations Just a few days ago, it was reported that nine Japenese banks have states using a Fujitsu blockchain settlement trial.

" Today marks 10 years of Bitcoin; its original white paper was released onto the internet on Halloween day, 2008. What began as an idea to challenge the financial establishment, has since grown to become a $110 billion market. The purpose of Bitcoin was straightforward; the digital asset, as a “purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”  By logging every transaction on a distributed ledger called the blockchain, the issue of “double spending” would also be solved. The ledger can be seen by anyone to verify that the transaction occurred. The network records every transaction and adds them to this ongoing chain, forming a log or record that can’t be changed or erased. As everyone has access to the network, no one body has control of it. Therefore it is secure and transparent. Blockchain technology is widely considered the most important innovation to come out of the creation of Bitcoin. So much so that this ‘distributed ledger’ technology has since been implemented by industries outside of cryptocurrency, including banking, farming, and healthcare. But those are only a few examples, and the list of adoption is constantly growing. Its first ten years has seen the digital currency spark mania. It has spawned hoards of imitator coins, it has risen to unprecedented values (20,000 per Bitcoin in 2017), and it has started an industry now rife with multi-billion dollar exchanges. Not to mention an industry of miners and blockchain coders. Bitcoin is even catching the attention of some of the world’s most powerful financial institutions despite being created to circumvent them. So, from such a small acorn came a ground-shaking oak tree. Invented by an anonymous cryptographer who went by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, on Halloween day, 2008, he, she, or they, wrote Bitcoin’s whitepaper and posted it to the world. Many have made claims to who Satoshi really is; Elon Musk was considered. He denied the claim. Some believe Nakamoto is a Japanese coder. But others believe the English on the whitepaper is too perfect and colloquial to not have been written by a native English speaker. So its first 10 years have seen massive financial gains and losses for hodlers of the coin. What will the next 10 years bring? Bitcoin’s original whitepaper has paved the way for technical advances that have occurred around Bitcoin. The value of the coin will always remain unpredictable, but the technological systems are only getting more advanced and more widespread. >> Coinbase is Now Valued at over $8 Billion After Series E Funding Round As developers and software engineers create different applications that improve the way we use Bitcoin and interact with the blockchain, user-experience is expected to improve: “Much like as internet based technology has improved over the years, mainstream Bitcoin users will understand very little of how the underlying protocols operate—they will simply follow the guidance of the applications they run on their machines.” Decentralization will obviously be a part of the future, but it will be interesting to note what industries adopt blockchain technology. One thing is for sure, Bitcoin turning 10 years old serves to remind us of how much this digital currency has changed the face of the current financial and technological era. Anything that can do that much in so little time paves the way for bigger things in the future. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© dmvasilenko",31-Oct,2018
" A US citizen from California has just pled guilty in federal court for operating an “unlicensed money business” selling Bitcoin (BTC), called LocalBitcoins.com. The Department of Justice (DoJ) released a press release about the case yesterday, October 29th. Jacob Burrell Campos has admitted to selling “hundreds of thousands” of dollars in Bitcoin (BTC) to over 1,000 customers on LocalBitcoins.com. The transactions took place from January 2015 to April 2016. The DoJ has characterized his sales as an unregistered ‘Bitcoin exchange.’ Burrell failed to register his business with the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the US Department of Treasury and did not apply due diligence on the sources of his client’s funds, such as AML. “Unlicensed money transmitting businesses, especially those operating at or near the border, pose a serious threat to the integrity of the US banking system, and provide an ‘open door’ for criminals to utilize such businesses to launder the proceeds of their illicit activities,” said US Attorney Adam Braverman. “The Department of Justice will continue to investigate and prosecute all individuals and businesses that seek to evade the licensing and anti-money laundering requirements under federal law.” In addition to failing to comply with federal regulations, Burrell admitted that his account on an unnamed US crypto exchange had been closed due to suspicious transactions. >> World Crypto Con: Joel Comm and Travis Wright Host the Show! After being shut down on that exchange, he turned to a Hong Kong-based platform and purchased $2.29 million worth of Bitcoin in a two-year span. Burrell conducted hundreds of transactions with this exchange from March 2015 to April 2017. The press release concludes with Burrell admitting that his exchanged USD was stored in Mexico. He has also pled guilty to making a false declaration on his federal tax return and is awaiting that trial in mid-December. Burrell imported over $1 million between late-2016 to early 2017, to evade tax declaration. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© stevanovicigor",30-Oct,2018
" The crypto market is suffering huge losses across the board today. And leading the drop-off is the largest coin by market cap; Bitcoin dropped from over $6,500 to a new two-week low of $6,243 in early trade today. The coin has lost over $200 in a 24-hour period, and as happens more commonly than not, there is no definite reason for the sudden drop. The sudden Bitcoin drop has come somewhat as a surprise. The world’s biggest coin has been hovering between $6,600 and $6,400 for 14-days straight. A stint that has notably been its least volatile period in over a year. But perhaps the Bitcoin drop was overdue. The equities market is about to close its worst month since 2008’s financial crisis, and where that market threads, Bitcoin tends to follow. Across the board, we can see the effect of the Bitcoin drop. But maybe investors are shaking in their boots because of a new report released today about Bitcoin and climate concerns. A new study released has detailed the massive impact Bitcoin may have on climate change. The culprit, of course, is mining. The amount of electricity involved in the process has the potential to boost global temperatures by more than two degrees by 2033.",29-Oct,2018
" It all started with a tweet by Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk. i🖤anime — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 22, 2018  I know, you’re probably wondering, “what does this have to do with Bitcoin?” Let me get to that. After the anime tweet, a user asked the tech entrepreneur when two-factor authentication would be applied to Tesla accounts, and Musk responded with this tweet. Wanna buy some Bitcoin? 😉😉 pic.twitter.com/9ZbBJ5fuVq — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 22, 2018  Immediately after the tweet, Twitter locked Musk’s account after thinking his account was hacked. Twitter has been flooded with crypto related spam for well over a year now, but it seems Twitter is starting to have a semi grip on the spam—at least the crypto spam potentially coming from high profile accounts. Elon Musk has been impersonated by scammers in the past, who have made fake accounts of him offering fake crypto ‘giveaways.’ Binance’s founder even took notice and responded to Musk’s tweet and said: Lol, it's spreading. I will buy a Tesla if you accept crypto… https://t.co/IgdieNZA0H — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) October 23, 2018  The rest of the comments were a flood of crypto enthusiasts promoting the digital token they’re most passionate about or people who were utterly confused. >> How to Lose Money Quickly Crypto Day Trading Unfortunately, Musk wasn’t actually endorsing or taking a stance on the digital currency but was simply making fun of it. That is correct — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 23, 2018  Bummer; the tech entrepreneur would be a huge contribution to the cryptocurrency space, despite his recent meltdowns. Musk has had a heck of a year this year. First, Tesla Model 3 production hit many snags, as the car model took longer to manufacture than previously anticipated. Investors started growing anxious wanting their car. Musk is also CEO of SpaceX and has been launching many rockets into space on a monthly basis in 2018, and he is CEO of the Boring Company, which is working on an underground trial tunnel under SpaceX’s headquarters to fix Los Angeles’ traffic problem. Currently, Mr. Musk is being investigated by the SEC for potential fraud. To say it’s been a bad year for him is probably the understatement of the year. While Musk may not be on the crypto train just yet—there’s still hope. Featured Image: wikimedia.org",23-Oct,2018
" According to sources, on October 16th, a Bitcoin user managed to transfer 29,999 BTC with a transaction fee of only $0.10. This amount of Bitcoin equates to $194 million, and a transaction of this magnitude would usually incur bank fees in the tens of thousands of dollars. With such a small Bitcoin fee for such a large transaction, will we see widespread adoption for big over-sea payments? Bitcoin transactions are a funny one. Often, complaints roll in by the dozen about the cost of transaction fees because to clear a transaction on such a high-volume network means paying for expensive miners. But this transaction shows the potential of the Bitcoin blockchain to perform cross-border payments cost-efficiently and effectively. Claims have risen before about transactions on the Bitcoin network costing $60. As recently as October 14th, cryptocurrency critic Nouriel Roubini, economist and professor at Stern School, made such a statement. However, his claim was met with fire: “BTC fees are less than $0.10, easily verifiable. If you value truth, you’d provide a public correction.” So if this transaction did indeed only cost the sender a small Bitcoin fee of $0.10, then it throws regular banks into chaos. >> Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum Foundation Hands Out Over $3 Million in Awards To put it in perspective, the cheapest platforms available to transfer fiat currency abroad still ask for a percentage of the cost, and that percentage is far greater than $0.10. For example, on a platform like Transferwise, to send over $1 million, it costs over $7,500 in transaction fees. Percentage-wise, this figure is less than 1% of $1 million, so $7,500 is considered cheap for a transfer that large. However, using the Bitcoin network at $0.10 for the same transaction is astronomically (and literally) cheaper than $7,500! The biggest issue with the Bitcoin network and transactions has been scalability. But this is an issue that is being resolved. Bitcoin’s Lightning network is offering the ability of on-chain and second-layer solutions. This means the network, in effect, can process small payments faster. But at the scale of $194 million, massive firms and investors will no doubt prefer the Bitcoin network for over-seas trading, would they not? Why would you want to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in bank fees when you can pay a small Bitcoin fee of 10 cents only? I know what I’d choose. What about you?

Last week, Bitcoin had its first major sell-off in months, but this morning it rose nearly $600 in less than an hour. Late last week, it looked as if Bitcoin was going to drop just below the $6,000 mark, but it’s now comfortably trading over $6,500. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $6,655.71 a coin, up 5.48%, in 24 hours.

" The cryptocurrency market took a huge hit nearly 12 hours ago when Bitcoin (BTC) abruptly dropped over $200 in value within minutes. After BTC dropped, a widespread cryptocurrency sell-off took place and hasn’t slowed down since. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $6,264.43 a coin, down -4.63%. Most of the cryptocurrency market has followed Bitcoin’s spiral, and most coins in the top 15 cryptocurrencies by their total market cap are seeing double-digit percentage losses. Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $201.10 a coin, down -11.07% in 24 hours, and XRP is now valued at $0.405 a coin, down -13.33%. The total cryptocurrency market cap has fallen by $19 billion in the past 24 hours. Since January, $600 billion has been wiped in value from the market. There are many speculations as to why Bitcoin tanked. One investor tweeted: It is plausible that investors and traders in Asia have contributed quite largely to the drop in the price of Bitcoin today. The volume of crypto exchanges in South Korea and Japan (Bithumb, Bitflyer) are huge. https://t.co/1nAHd9BezV — Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) October 11, 2018  The tweet still doesn’t explain why there was a sell-off, but it may show where it predominantly came from. “The global sell-off in equities has indeed spilled over to the crypto space,” Ryan Rabaglia, head of trading with cryptocurrency dealing firm OSL in Hong Kong, told Fortune. “The days of crypto being the safe-haven play and having a high degree of detachment from the rest of the world are seemingly diminishing.” Rabaglia seems to think that the global sell-off of equities has spilled over into the crypto space. Another analyst felt the Bitcoin dip was due to panic selling. Panic selling was the cause of the drop of cryptocurrency from January to February, but is that the case now? “What we’re seeing now is a bit of panic selling,” Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM told CNBC. “Investors that were in it, and maybe caught the hype in November and December, are now panic selling out.” I’m not so much convinced in the panic selling.

" Venezuela’s economic crisis continues to worsen, despite the president’s controversial attempts to revive his country. The demand for Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies continues to rise this year, as the country’s dollar, the bolivar, continues to drop. Venezuela has hit crisis mode extreme, but can BTC save them? According to Coin Dance, Venezuelan residents’ interest in Bitcoin (BTC) reached its peak in July of this year. Most countries have declined since January of 2018, when the total crypto market hit its all-time high. In December, BTC hit just under $20,000 a coin, and altcoins hit record-highs the first week of January. Since then, the crypto market has dropped $500 billion in value. The interest recently in Bitcoin by the residents in Venezuela at this time is rather shocking. However, with the country’s economic downfall, it seems its residents are doing anything to try and survive in their country. According to the International Organization for Migration, since the year 2015, around 1.6 million people had fled from Venezuela. Many have fled to other South American countries such as Peru, Brazil, Argentina, and Columbia. >> Malta Prime Minister: Cryptocurrency is the “Inevitable Future of Money” Back on August 10th, five zeros were dropped from the country’s currency after its inflation levels had risen to stratospheric levels. The country rolled out a ‘new’ and revamped currency just after this and its inflation rose 100% in just three weeks, the Financial Express reported. At this time, investments in BTC remained at record-highs around the country. Other than devaluing the country’s currency by 100% and renaming it to the sovereign bolivar, the country’s president, Nicola Maduro, announced his oil-backed cryptocurrency that would be pegged to the new Bolivar. This was in hopes to go around sanctions and gain access to international finances to get the inflation under control. Many within Venezuela felt this was illegal and many countries urged their banks not to buy Venezuelan debt. Despite Maduro making strong efforts to push his Petro coin, interest has dropped dramatically, and residents are still sticking to Bitcoin (BTC).

" Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) plans to offer its customers complex derivatives that will be tied to Bitcoin (BTC), Bloomberg reported this morning. The Morgan Stanley Bitcoin derivatives will push the investment bank in the running with its competition currently dabbing in the cryptocurrency space. According to a person familiar with the venture, Morgan Stanley, one of the world’s largest investment banks, is trying to create ways for its client to get involved in the digital currency market. Institutional investors have shown that they don’t want to actually own any Bitcoin but more so want to trade for or against the price of it. The US bank will deal with contracts that give its investors synthetic exposure to the performance of cryptocurrency, the individual involved in the matter told Bloomberg. The bank is already prepared to offer Bitcoin and plans on launching when institutional client demand is proven. Morgan Stanley investors will be able to go long or short using their so-called price return Bitcoin swaps. The investment bank will charge a spread for each transaction, the person said. >> OKEx Founder Released from Custody and Denies Fraud Many of Wall Street’s biggest banks are pushing ahead their plans to offer the derivatives tied to Bitcoin, despite the crypto market’s downturn in January. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) are also preparing new products that are tied to Bitcoin. Last week, there were rumors floating around that Goldman Sachs had abandoned its plans to build a crypto trading desk. This put the entire crypto market in a total tailspin, but two days later the bank’s CFO called the news “fake.” Once banks see a demand for products such as Bitcoin derivatives, they are more than equipped to start offering them. The question then remains is, when will this happen? Will it take a monumental rise in the digital currency to spark institutional interest again? We will soon find out.

" Yesterday, First Block Capital Inc, a Canadian blockchain and cryptocurrency investment company, announced that its Bitcoin (BTC) trust has achieved mutual fund status in Canada. Due to this, it allows investors to place funds in registered accounts such as Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSP) or Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSA). Block’s FBC Bitcoin (BTC) trust allows qualified investors to gain exposure to BTC without having to buy, store or manage the cryptocurrency. These trust units are considered a qualified investment for a mutual fund trust under the Tax Act. “Since inception, First Block Capital has been committed to providing investors with regulated, titled and auditable exposure to investment vehicles based on blockchain and cryptocurrency,” said Sean Clark, Co-Founder, and CEO of First Block. “Our team is extremely proud to maintain our market leading position and will continue to execute our vision of creating a fleet of investible products dedicated to the space.” The trust is available on NEO Connect, under the ticket FBCBT and is only available to accredited investors. Advisors are able to trade the fund with the same ease and efficiency as trading regular ETFs. NEO Connect distributes 46 funds, managed by three asset managers, over 15 dealer networks. This comes to servicing nearly $600 million worth of assets. “Today, for the first time in Canada, accredited investors working with investment advisors can seamlessly take positions in bitcoin through the FBC Bitcoin Trust,” said Joe Schmitt, president and CEO of NEO. “As the world evolves, we are very pleased our unique fund distribution platform can help the investment community access, with ease and efficiency, an ever-expanding spectrum of new and innovative asset classes.” >> Stellar (XLM) Embraced by Visa-Backed Blockchain Company This Bitcoin mutual fund was approved by the OSC (Ontario Securities Commission) and BCSC (British Columbia Securities Commission) and marks the first product of its kind in Canada.

" If you’ve been monitoring the cryptocurrency market on a daily or weekly basis, you probably noticed that the market took a big nosedive this week. This is mostly due to the rumor going around mainstream media about Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) putting a stop to its Bitcoin exchange desk—a rumor that the Goldman Sachs CFO put a stop to. The story originated from Business Insider. There are other speculations as to why the market dropped, but the overall consensus comes down to panic selling because the giant investment bank pulled its crypto plans. Goldman Sachs CFO, Marty Chavez, spoke out today at TechCrunch Disrupt and put an end to those rumors. “I was in New York yesterday, and I was co-chairing our risk committee, and I saw the news article,” Chavez told Tech Crunch. “It wasn’t like we announced anything or that anything had changed for us… I never thought I’d hear myself actually use this term, but I’d really have to describe that as fake news.” The CFO said that his bank is still considering how it will offer Bitcoin services to its clients. Goldman Sachs has been building a Bitcoin trading platform that is modeled on a commodities futures trading platform. This means that there is never any Bitcoin traded on the platform, but more the promise that the currency might move in the future. Chavez states that the next step for his bank is ‘non-deliverable forwards’ or derivatives. The exec explained that these would be over the counter derivatives. >> Robinhood Wants to Go Public—Trading Platform will Launch an IPO Chavez explained: “They’re settled in U.S. dollars and the reference price is the Bitcoin U.S. dollar price established by a set of exchanges, the same one that’s referenced in the futures contracts, and we’re working on that now because the clients wanted physical Bitcoin — something tremendously interesting and tremendously challenging. From the perspective of custody, we don’t yet see an institutional grade custody cases custodian solution for Bitcoin.” Yes, people. Even Business Insider gets things wrong too. Not to panic, Goldman Sachs isn’t bowing out of the crypto game any time soon. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© belchonock",7-Sep,2018
" Cryptocurrency enthusiasts and bulls have been hopeful that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will grant the first Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund) this year. However, these bulls have been left disappointed recently as the SEC has handed out a handful of rejections and postponements. Bill Barhydt, CEO of Bitcoin payment start-up Abra, told CNBC that it’s because the applications sent in haven’t fit the financial archetype that the SEC is looking for. “I think the issue with the SEC, quite frankly, is that the people who are doing the applications don’t fit the mold of who the SEC is used to approving,” Barhydt told CNBC today. The CEO states that he used to work for Goldman Sachs and made a point to address his clothing attire in comparison to how these ETF applications are being sent in. Many of the new tech start-ups and blockchain company executives have a much laxer work attire compared to those working on Wall Street. Barhydt states that he couldn’t just go into the SEC wearing what he’s wearing and expect them to accept an application for distributing ETFs. It has nothing to do with clothing, per say, but has everything to do with the reputation and foundation of the company applying to distribute bitcoin ETFs. So far this year, the financial watchdog has rejected multiple bitcoin ETF proposals. Bitcoin (BTC) futures were introduced back in mid-December, and many believe ETFs are the next vital step for transforming the crypto space into a mainstream industry. Abra’s CEO told CNBC that for an application to be approved by the SEC, it would take an applicant who “looks, feels, and smells” the way the SEC wants them to. >> Kingdom Trust Secures Crypto Insurance from Llyod’s of London “It’s going to happen in the next year, I would actually make a bet on it,” Barhydt said. “There is too much demand for it.” It seems the Abra exec is pretty confident in Bitcoin ETFs coming to the markets soon.

" The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected nine applications for Bitcoin ETF proposals. The SEC published three separate orders yesterday, highlighting the rejections from the three different applicants. This ruling is a blow to Bitcoin bulls who’d hoped the products would have provided a breakthrough for institutional adoption. Last night, the SEC published its rejection of two proposals from ProShares, two from GraniteShares, and five other products from Direxion. The rejections come just one day ahead of the deadline stipulated for a pair of Bitcoin ETFs submitted by ProShares. Proshares was working with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ETF exchange NYSE Arca. The SEC said the proposals did not do enough to show they were “designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.” All applications denied were directly linked to Bitcoin futures contracts. The SEC said that none of the nine applications had enough information to show that the futures markets are of “significant size.” >> SEC ETF Delay “That failure is critical because, as explained below, the Exchange has failed to establish that other means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices will be sufficient, and therefore surveillance-sharing with a regulated market of significant size related to bitcoin is necessary,” the SEC wrote. In short, if the Bitcoin futures market is too small, the SEC fears it could be easily manipulated. Last December, the commodities trading venues CBOE and CME launched the first Bitcoin futures, but the daily trade volume still remains small. This isn’t the first SEC Bitcoin ETF rejection though. In July, the US Olympian Winklevoss Twins, who own the crypto exchange Gemini, were denied their Bitcoin ETF proposal as well. Unsurprisingly, the crypto market has dropped since the SEC ruling. At press time, the total cryptocurrency market is sitting just over $200 billion. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading below the $6,500 mark, and Ethereum (ETH) is just below $375. 98% of the coins within the top 100 cryptocurrencies are seeing losses this morning.

" Two days after Jim Cramer made bearish comments on Bitcoin, the BTC price has started to revive itself. A bullish reversal is not yet confirmed, as Bitcoin would have to break above key resistance for that to happen.  However, the BTC price has moved back to above $6,000, which indicates a trend reversal could very well be in progress.  And yet, Cramer has still thrown in the Bitcoin towel. He even did so on the day that Bitcoin crossed a high of $6,259. So what gives? It’s difficult to say, as the crypto market is somewhat divided this week. Some are saying it’s game-over for Bitcoin, while others are confident BTC is eyeing a new target for bull reversal. For those believing Bitcoin is coming to an end, we have Jim Cramer.  On Tuesday, Cramer, who is the co-founder of the TheStreet, said to his CNBC audience that Bitcoin nearing 2018 lows suggests that the possibility of recovery is becoming less likely. Here, the 63-year-old former hedge fund manager is likely talking about the February low of $6,000, which, if the BTC price falls during the rest of the week, is possible of being hit.  Jim Cramer didn’t outright state that Bitcoin is broken, which is a notion Tom Lee has denied this month. He even made it clear that he’s “not saying its time has passed,” but simply that there is something suggesting “the sun seems to be setting” on the virtual currency. But is he right?  At press time, Bitcoin is selling for $6,356.38, which puts the coin down 0.70% in the past twenty-four hours.  The gist is this: if Bitcoin can move past $6,675, then it’s safe to say a bullish trend reversal has arrived. Sounds like a faraway goal based on today’s BTC activity, but let us not forget the coin jumped to $6,649 on Wednesday. ",16-Aug,2018

Now you can use Cash App to buy bitcoin in all 50 states. pic.twitter.com/D4fhVRz7WL — Cash App (@CashApp) August 13, 2018 Square was originally founded by Twitter’s CEO, Jack Dorsey. The Cash App initially rolled out its Bitcoin services months ago but had to go state-by-state to get approval. Recently, it was reported that Square also secured the so-called ‘BitLicense’ in New York, making it one of only a few cryptocurrency services that are allowed to operate within the state. Georgia, Hawaii, Wyoming, and New York have the strictest crypto regulations, but it seems the Square cash app finally won their approval. This is huge news for the cryptocurrency market, as buying Bitcoin can be a confusing task for most individuals. Making it easier for people to purchase and use is key to mass adoption of the crypto space. It seems Jack Dorsey knows this and is steps ahead of his competition. Announced by CNBC this morning. Square’s Cash app has surpassed Paypal’s Venmo for the first time. According to data composed by the Sensor Tower and Nomura Instinet, the Cash app had a total of 33.5 million downloads in the month of July, compared to Venmo’s 32.9 million. As a result of this news, Square’s stock rose this morning after the opening bell and its shares are up 726 percent since its IPO back in 2015. “If the Cash App continues to grow rapidly, the business could reach or even exceed $100 million in sales by 2020, even without deeper active user penetration,” Dolev said in a note to clients Tuesday. “With impressive user growth and ongoing decoupling from Bitcoin, we believe Square’s monetization efforts are increasingly bearing fruit.” The easier access to Bitcoin, the better it will be for the cryptocurrency industry. It seems both Square and its Cash App will continue to grow and this means positive movement in the crypto space. >> Crypto Retirement Funds Pose Too Much Risk, Says SEC: Don’t Do It Featured Image: Twitter",14-Aug,2018
" Both Bitcoin bears and bulls will be watching the BTC price over the weekend. While some see a potential corrective rally occurring, others believe the cryptocurrency is at the end of its road. One Wall Street analyst believes the latter. In fact, Jeff deGraaf said it’s “game over” for Bitcoin. But is that true? Yesterday, CNBC reported that Jeff deGraaf of Renaissance Macro Research declared that Bitcoin is “permanently impaired.” He then added that investors should start betting against the cryptocurrency, but only if it breaks through its year-to-date support. There are a lot of people in the crypto community that cause panic when it’s not needed, but deGraaf is not one of those people. Being a respected Wall Street chart technician, the man knows the subject he is speaking on quite well. There’s no denying that the Bitcoin market has taken a hit over the past three weeks. After hitting a high of $8,450 in July, Bitcoin has dropped back down to the $6,000 level. But despite analysts like Jeff deGraaf thinking it’s game-over for Bitcoin, there are people like Tom Lee who remain confident that Bitcoin is not broken. In fact, the Bitcoin Misery Index appears to indicate so. The crypto market is one big game of speculation. People are always going to have different opinions on the direction of the market. Therefore, the best thing to do is to keep an eye on crypto prices yourself. Here’s what the numbers are telling us on Friday, August 10th. At press time, Bitcoin is selling for $6,474.43, which puts the coin down 0.26% in the past twenty-four hours. Today’s close is going to be very important. If Bitcoin can close above $6,628, then it’s likely that Tom Lee is correct when he said Bitcoin isn’t broken. However, if the BTC price closes below $6,183 today, then the words spoken by deGraaf yesterday are likely true. What do you think about what deGraaf said? Is it really game-over for Bitcoin? Moreover, where do you think the BTC price will close today? >> Golden Gate Ventures to Launch $10 Million Blockchain and Crypto Fund Featured Image: Depositphotos/© EdZbarzhyvetsky",10-Aug,2018
" The latest Bitcoin news is that Bitcoin (BTC) has taken a major hit this week and has dragged the rest of the cryptocurrency market down with it. At press time, the total cryptocurrency market is sitting at just above $225 billion, which is $75 billion lower than what it was just two weeks ago. Within the last 24 hours, the crypto market has dropped almost $20 billion. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $6,509.67, down -8.50% in 24 hours. For the week, BTC price is down -14.47%, and for the month, Bitcoin price is down -5.15%. This month, Bitcoin had a brief rally that left many crypto enthusiasts hopeful for a brighter tomorrow, but it seems the coin has corrected again. A lot of you seem to think that the ETF approval is not necessary in order for the market to flourish once again. Think again! ETF approval is an absolute necessity to continued $BTC success. Total MC is as high as it’s going to get w/out. SEC ETF approval is the next catalyst. — WolfofCrypto (@bullishgentlemn) August 7, 2018 The Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC) has postponed its decision on approving Bitcoin’s ETF once again, a decision which is entirely being blamed for the market’s downfall. The CBOE, VanEck, and SolidX have all put in a request to offer Bitcoin ETFs and the SEC isn’t ready to make a decision on this just yet. If approved, many believe this could propel the cryptocurrency market to another level—very similar to what the Bitcoin futures were anticipated to do. Bitcoin ETFs would, in fact, help to bring in more institutional investors, where the real money is. Adoption is key to the longevity of cryptocurrency, and the SEC knows that the decision shouldn’t be made swiftly. It remains still unknown when Jay Clayton and the committee will come up with a decision, but we can expect the market to fall until they do. >> Opera Launching a Built-In Crypto Wallet for Its Desktop Web Browser Featured Image: mdkhalil1",8-Aug,2018
" Tom Lee has always remained optimistic about Bitcoin. True, the Tom Lee Bitcoin price target did change from $25 thousand to $20 thousand last month, but the Fundstrat co-founder is still confident. In fact, Lee remains confident because of what the Fundstrat Bitcoin Misery Index is indicating. On Monday, Tom Lee went against the Bitcoin bears, announcing that no, Bitcoin “isn’t broken,” even if it stays at the current price—which, at press time, is $7,120.73. He also said that Bitcoin is not broken if it’s holding at the current volatility levels. But why does Tom Lee think that? Well, it boils down to what the Bitcoin Misery Index is describing. Back in March, Fundstrat launched the Bitcoin Misery Index, which is essentially a way for investors to know if holders of the coin are ‘miserable’ or not. It’s all based on volatility and price. According to Lee, the Bitcoin Misery Index’s current number is 39, which means it is neither in ‘good’ territory nor ‘selling’ territory. If the index falls below 27, it means future returns are good. No one has to panic (like how people do in the crypto space when prices drop). However, if the index moves past 68%, then you know that it is ‘time to sell’ the cryptocurrency. Despite being higher than 27, Lee thinks the index shows that momentum is en route to recovery. In the interview, Lee pointed out that the crypto industry has seen good things come out recently, in terms of Bitcoin. For instance, the SEC has declared Bitcoin not to be a security. Not to mention the ICE announcing last week its intent to create an integrated virtual assets platform. Huge, considering ICE is the operator of dozens of exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange. There are three things I want to ask: first, do you agree with the $20 thousand Tom Lee price target? Two: Do you believe the Fundstrat Bitcoin Misery Index? Third: Is momentum truly recovering? >> Robinhood to Support Ethereum Classic Ahead of Coinbase—Sneaky! Featured Image: Twitter",7-Aug,2018
" Bitcoin for coffee. It has a nice ring to it. But actually using Bitcoin (BTC) to buy coffee? Turns into a big mess real fast. However, that might be about to change. Starbucks just hinted that it might soon have a way to make using BTC to pay for coffee a whole lot easier for its loyalists. Currently, it’s possible to buy Starbucks coffee with Bitcoin, but it isn’t an easy process. The global coffee giant in the past teamed up with Square, which accepts Bitcoin. However, it isn’t as easy as whipping out your iPhone and paying with the Starbucks app or even your debit card. But will that be changing soon? According to Bloomberg, the beverage retailer has just teamed up with the world’s biggest exchange operator, Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE) to create Bakkt. Reports surfaced back in May of ICE working on a Bitcoin trading platform. This morning, ICE officially announced the creation of Bakkt. CEO of Bakkt, Kelly Loeffler, commented on her company in the press release and said: “Bakkt is designed to serve as a scalable on-ramp for institutional, merchant and consumer participation in digital assets by promoting greater efficiency, security, and utility. We are collaborating to build an open platform that helps unlock the transformative potential of digital assets across global markets and commerce.” In the press release, the company announced that it was working with Microsoft, BCG, and Starbucks on its new company Bakkt. It remains unknown how Bakkt plans on reducing the high fees associated with Bitcoin transactions, which make using Bitcoin for everyday purchases, like a cup of coffee, rather inconvenient. “As the flagship retailer, Starbucks will play a pivotal role in developing practical, trusted and regulated applications for consumers to convert their digital assets into US dollars for use at Starbucks,” said Starbucks Payments VP Maria Smith in a statement. “As a leader in Mobile Pay to our more than 15 million Starbucks Rewards members, Starbucks is committed to innovation for expanding payment options for our customers.” Many believe that this is big news for the cryptocurrency as the big question for most is, “Where can you spend it?” Currently, there seems to be some demand to make it easier to accept digital currencies, although Starbucks wouldn’t be the first retailer to accept them. Overstock.com started accepting Bitcoin back in 2014. Still, the high fees have yet to be addressed, so, we’ll just have to wait and see. Featured Image: Twitter",3-Aug,2018
" Goldman Sachs appears to have mixed feelings towards Bitcoin. Earlier in 2018, the bank said it was planning on opening a BTC trading desk. Yesterday, a former Goldman Sachs executive said a Bitcoin ETF was possible. Yet, in the Goldman Sachs midyear economic-outlook report, Bitcoin was reported to decline even more than it has so far already this year. According to the bank’s investment strategy group, Bitcoin’s price has declined by 45% this year, and it’s not going to stop anytime soon. Why, though? Sure, we’ve all seen the price dips. However, we’ve also seen what it can do when BTC is having a good day. According to Goldman Sachs’ investment strategy group, there will be further declines in cryptocurrencies because they do not match the conventional expectations of what a currency is supposed to be. First, Bitcoin is not a medium of exchange, according to the bank. Second, cryptocurrencies are not a unit of measurement. And third, they are not a store of value. Yes and no. If you’re interested in the activity of broader financial assets, cryptocurrency declines shouldn’t impact your life too much. Why? Because “cryptocurrencies represent just 0.3% of world GDP as of mid-2018.” For the most part, the New York-based company has expressed bearish views on cryptocurrency, which lines up with the Goldman Sachs midyear economic-outlook report. Back in November, CEO Lloyd Blankfein said BTC is not a valid currency and is a way to “perpetrate fraud.” Then in January, the bank warned investors that Bitcoin was in bubble territory. Here’s where the different opinions come in. Fast forward to May of 2018 and Goldman Sachs announced its intent to launch Bitcoin futures contracts. Fast forward even more to August of 2018 and a former executive for the bank, Ali Hassan, said a Bitcoin ETF is very likely to happen. That said, Hassan did say that this will only happen once the digital asset proves it doesn’t pose a risk to investors. Do you agree with what was said about Bitcoin in the Goldman Sachs midyear economic-outlook report? >> Bitcoin is Getting Bakkt! NYSE Owner to Offer Federally Regulated Market for Bitcoin Featured Image: Depositphotos/© spaxiax",3-Aug,2018
" Announced this morning is some pretty major news that Bitcoin bulls have been waiting for: Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)—the trading giant that owns the New York Stock Exchange—has a goal of breaking Bitcoin into mainstream currency and it plans to do this by forming a new company called Bakkt.  Bakkt is soon to be launched by Wall Street’s major player, but it also joins forces with some of America’s biggest companies, including Microsoft and Starbucks.  This morning ICE announced that its new company is expected to launch in November. Bakkt aims to offer a federally regulated market for Bitcoin, transforming Bitcoin into a trusted global currency with broad usage.  Yowza. As mentioned, ICE is not acting alone. The new venture also involves heavyweights in the form of Microsoft (technology), Starbucks (retail), and Boston Consulting Group (consulting). Responding to the news, Maria Smith—Vice President of Partnerships, and Payments for Starbucks—said the following about the coffee-chains involvement: “As the flagship retailer, Starbucks will play a pivotal role in developing practical, trusted and regulated applications for consumers to convert their digital assets into US dollars for use at Starbucks.” >> Crypto Daily News: Coinbase Adds British Pound and John McAfee’s “Unhackable Wallet” Gets Hacked The main goal of Bakkt is to make Bitcoin a secure offering for the biggest global financial institutions that now mostly shun it. It wants to create a path for these major money managers to offer Bitcoin mutual funds, pension funds, and ETFs as highly regulated, mainstream investments. ICE’s head of digital assets, Kelly Loeffler, will now serve as CEO of Bakkt. She had this to say regarding the company:  “Bakkt is designed to serve as a scalable on-ramp for institutional, merchant, and consumer participation in digital assets by promoting greater efficiency, security, and utility…We are collaborating to build an open platform that helps unlock the transformative potential of digital assets across global markets and commerce.” Currently, Bakkt is in preparation for launch in November.

" Online bank Swissquote opened its banking doors to accommodate Bitcoin trading accounts for its clients in July of 2017. It was thought to be the first European online bank to do this. A year on, and Swissquote has revealed the fruits of its labor for adopting the cryptocurrency with a 44% surge in profits attributed to the “Crypto Boom” in the early half of 2018. According to Finews, the online bank’s massive growth in Q1 2018 was thanks to a “brisk demand” for crypto products and the eruption of the crypto markets earlier this year. >>CEO of Fatfish Internet: Crypto ETF Coming Soon, Despite Recent Rejections The profit was $26.01 million in the first half of 2018 representing a whopping 44% increase over the previous year. The bank sharply increased in trader activity and new customer accounts also.  But this is not the first time, the bank has seen its earnings soar because of Bitcoin. In January it was “swamped with interest” in Bitcoin trading as, according to Swissquote, “several thousand new account applications [were] being submitted every week.” >>IBM Blockchain Platform Targets Banks and Financial Institutions To be more precise, in the first half of 2018, the number of customer accounts in Swissquote’s commercial sector increased by 16,278. But not only an increase in accounts, the bank saw the average transaction amount grow to 11.8 transactions, which is a considerable jump when compared to the previous year’s one transaction over the same period. Since beginning its cryptocurrency adoption in 2017 with Bitcoin, Swissquote expanded its offering and by December 2017, it had added support for four other major cryptocurrencies; Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash. Last March, it introduced an exchange-traded product (ETP) that tracks a multi-cryptocurrency index. Swissquote’s crypto ETP is listed on the country’s largest stock exchange, the Six Swiss Exchange.

" Kim Kardashian promotes Bitcoin: Reality television star Kim Kardashian-West announced to her 114 million Instagram (IG) followers that she staked a physical Bitcoin (BTC) in a charity poker event in LA last night. West’s sisters, Kendall Jenner and Khloe Kardashian, along with their mother Kris Jenner, hosted a table at yesterday’s ‘If Only’ Texas Hold’Em Charity Poker event. This charity event was geared towards raising funds for the City of Hope, a nonprofit clinical research and treatment center for cancer. During the poker event, Kim Kardashian West video recorded all of her poker chips showing how much she had put into the event. The next video showed that she had “moved onto Bitcoin.” Crypto entrepreneur Matt Roszak attended the City of Hope event and claimed that he gave Kardashian-West the physical Bitcoin shown in Kim’s IG pictures above.

Still, she holds 114 million followers on Instagram that have potentially just been introduced to Bitcoin for the very first time. The rest of the TV star’s IG story, however, had nothing to do with cryptocurrency and more to do with how “skinny” she looked—figures. We should see this as a win for crypto, despite the short mention and zero explanation. >> How To Invest in Bitcoin  According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin (BTC) didn’t see a spike in price within the last 24 hours as one would have expected from the celebrity endorsement. It may have been that Kim’s viewers had no idea how to even invest in Bitcoin. At press time, BTC is trading at $8,048.22 a coin, down -1.77%, in 24 hours. Featured Image: Twitter",30-Jul,2018
" Bitcoin has had quite the year. It hasn’t all been good, with the digital currency dropping below the $6,000 price mark at the end of June. But recently Bitcoin has redeemed itself, witnessing strong gains over the last week. So that brings up the question of whether there are catalysts driving Bitcoin higher. If not now, could there be catalysts at a later date? Spencer Bogart, the co-founder of Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm, seems to think so. There is a better atmosphere in the crypto industry right now. For the first time in a while, people are looking at the BTC price and feeling hopeful, reminiscent. Erik Voorhees is one of these people. Welcome back $8000 🙂 #bitcoin — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) July 24, 2018  But that doesn’t mean Bitcoin is where it should be, nor is it close to previous levels, like its high of $19,783.21, achieved in December of last year. Spencer Bogart, a former Bitcoin analyst, recognizes this, and yet, he told CNBC on Wednesday that he still expects “to see new highs.” But how? If people are edging away from Bitcoin and towards other cryptocurrencies, how will Bitcoin move higher than $9,000? $10,000? Well, according to Bogart, there are a few potential catalysts driving Bitcoin higher. 1. A Potential Bitcoin ETF A few days ago, Bitwise announced that it had filed with the SEC for an ETF that would track less than a dozen cryptocurrencies, with one being Bitcoin. Members of the company said that at the rate the market is moving, there’s a chance the SEC would “allow a crypto ETF onto the market.” (However, given recent light, this may still not be happening any time soon.) 2. Increasing Currency Rates 3. Mastercard’s New Patent Earlier this month, Mastercard announced a new patent regarding Bitcoin transactions. As a result, consumers may one day be charging their purchases (coffee, shopping, travel, you name it!) on their credit cards using Bitcoin (BTC). 4. Global Trade Tensions Overall, Bogart considers Bitcoin to be a “tinderbox” at the moment. In his interview with CNBC, Bogart concluded that the Bitcoin (BTC) price is “waiting for reasons to go higher.” Is he right, though? Both about the catalysts driving Bitcoin higher and that the currency is “waiting” to soar? At press time, Bitcoin is selling for $8,202.29, which puts BTC down 0.08% in the past twenty-four hours. >> Crypto Daily News: Crypto Market Falls and CME Altcoin Futures Put On Hold Featured image: annca via Pixabay",27-Jul,2018
" Bitcoin (BTC) price has climbed above the $8,100 mark for the first time today since mid-May. Bitcoin’s bull run this week is leading many to predict a return of its 2017 bull run that pushed BTC to almost $20,000. July 16th seems to have started this run when BlackRock, the world’s largest exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider, announced that its company had assembled a group to look into cryptocurrencies, more specifically, Bitcoin (BTC). This news immediately boosted BTC into the green with 4% gains. BlackRock, to date, has managed nearly $6.4 trillion in assets. News of potential institutional investors dipping their toes into the market has given cryptocurrencies a boost in the past. With the world’s largest ETF provider eyeing cryptocurrencies, it seems investors have gained more confidence in crypto. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still mulling over whether it will approve a Bitcoin ETF, which was first filed through the Chicago Board of Exchange (CBOE). If approved, a Bitcoin ETF would mean individuals would be able to buy Bitcoin without having to go through crypto exchanges, many of which have been having serious security issues and have been hacked (which may lead some people to be wary of using them). The ICO Journal reported late last week that it is highly likely that a Bitcoin ETF will be approved. “I would call [the likelihood of approval] 90% at this point. The crypto markets have moderated and regulators have watched the lack of drama surrounding bitcoin futures across several global exchanges,” one of the ICO Journal’s unnamed sources, from the CFTC, reportedly said. “The price moderation and adoption of a peer product is what the conversations have centered around. In January we were justifiably concerned about a bubble and the harm a quickly approved product could attract speculators and create losses that led to significant lawsuits. Now, those factors seem to be mitigated significantly.” However, new reports have surfaced that the SEC will be pushing back their decision until September. The Bitcoin (BTC) bull run has extended over ten days and doesn’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon. For the week, Bitcoin is up 20%. The largest cryptocurrency has also boosted the rest of the market, as mostly all coins in the top 25 are sitting in the green currently. Bitcoin’s dominance of the entire cryptocurrency market has just hit 47%, which hasn’t been reached since BTC skyrocketed to its all-time high price back in December 2017. A year ago, Bitcoin held a very similar percentage hold on the market at 47.9%. At press time, BTC is trading at $8,179 a coin, up 6.07% in 24 hours. For the week, BTC is up 20.86%, and for the month, the digital currency is up 39%. >> Bitcoin is Bullish but the G20’s Still Out on Regulation Featured Image: unsplash/© Bernard Hermant",24-Jul,2018
" Marc Lasry Predicts: Bitcoin has been on a run this week. The coin made a whopping and sudden 10% gain yesterday and it is still heading skyward. Currently, it is sitting pretty at $7,457. This week’s gains are surprising to some considering Bitcoins recent moves; it seemed everything was steadily going southward. Avenue Capital Group CEO, Marc Lasry, has always regretted not buying Bitcoin when it was $300. The billionaire spoke of his regret back in December and has spoken out favorably for the coin again today with a bullish prediction that it will hit the $40k mark this year.  In an interview with CNBC’s “Squawk Box”, the billionaire also added: “As it gets more into the mainstream, and as more markets end up allowing it to trade where it’s freely tradable, to me that’s more of the bet.” If this week’s gains are to continue he may be right.",18-Jul,2018
" Bitcoin (BTC) is having a phenomenal 24 hours on the market; a bull run we haven’t seen from the digital currency in months. Let’s check in on the Bitcoin price. Last week, Bitcoin had an unimpressive week on the market, but it seems to have turned itself around as BTC has seen over a 15% increase in just seven days. This doesn’t compare to the percentage gains the cryptocurrency was seeing towards the end of last year, but it’s a positive step. This morning, Bitcoin gained over $10 billion in total market cap in just under an hour. The push by the world’s first cryptocurrency has caused the market to rise right along with it, and two altcoins, Cardano (#8) and Stellar (#6), are currently seeing percentage gains above 25%. At press time, BTC is trading at $7,442.51 a coin, up 10.66% in 24 hours. Bitcoin hasn’t seen this price point in over a month. The world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum (ETH), is also seeing percentage gains. At press time, ETH is trading just under $500 at $496.75 a coin, up 5.53% in 24 hours. For months, the main news circulating around cryptocurrency has been about hacks, regulations, and celebrity skeptics. The news has caused many investors to lose confidence in the cryptocurrency space and is the reason why the market has been on a decline since early May. What might have turned it all around the past couple of days was the BlackRock announcement. BlackRock is the world’s largest exchange-traded fund and the company’s CEO announced that BlackRock was forming its own group to look into cryptocurrencies. This announcement hit the masses on Monday morning and caused Bitcoin (BTC) to spike nearly 6% instantaneously. Yesterday, Bitcoin spiked 10% in less than an hour, and it was speculated that Goldman Sach’s CEO was to thank. News broke that his company is preparing to launch a ‘proper’ crypto trading platform. This morning, Mastercard announced that it is filing another blockchain patent—which most likely aided the spike in Bitcoin further this morning. How high will Bitcoin go? We shall see!

" BlackRock exploring crypto: The CEO of the world’s largest exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider, BlackRock, just announced that his company has assembled a group to look into cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC). Larry Fink told Reuters that he does not see “massive investor demand” currently, but his company will continue to look into cryptocurrency regardless. Fink didn’t have much to add to his statement, but any news regarding BlackRock potentially making moves into the cryptocurrency space is good news. As of June 30th, the company has managed nearly $6.4 trillion in assets. A spokesperson from BlackRock sent an email to CNBC about the latest company news and said: “We have been looking at blockchain technology for several years, recognizing potential for shared processes and data across market participants, clearing, settlement and reconciliation and simplified securities issuance.” This working group was established back in 2015, but it seems that the group may be eyeing cryptocurrencies more closely now. The cryptocurrency market jumped up this morning as news spread about the ETF provider’s interest in crypto. News like this gives investors confidence, but will it last? Lately, there has been nothing but news about cryptocurrency regulations around the world, which has driven the market down to its year-low of just over $235 billion on June 29th. While this BlackRock news isn’t really new news at all, it does show that the company is serious about its explorations. The CEO’s comments this morning may have been to boost his company’s image, as Blackrock’s main competitor, Fidelity, has been exploring blockchain extensively for quite some time. At press time, the total cryptocurrency market is trading just below $266 billion. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $6,606.76 a coin, up 3.86%, in 24 hours.

" You gotta love the believers. TenX’s co-founder Julian Hosp is definitely bullish about market leader BTC with his prediction for the second half of 2018. At the RISE tech conference in Hong Kong the crypto wallet and card start-up founder said to CNBC: “I predicted for 2018, we’re going to see $5,000 and $60,000. So $5,000, we pretty much hit it, so let’s see if we can do the $60,000. I’m still quite confident.” It’s an interesting range-covering prediction. And while the coin has come “close” to $5,000 this year, it hasn’t actually hit it. The lowest we’ve seen this year is June’s $5,700. The way the market has been faring of late though, bears seem to be holding down the fort and it wouldn’t be a surprising turn of events if BTC did hit the $5K mark.  The appropriate question is ‘When? rather than ‘If’.  On the other end of the scale, reaching $60K (which is triple the amount of Bitcoin’s all-time-high of $20K) would take some major event to push the coin price up there. Hosp does recognize this. He is a believer, but not blindly bullish, stating that it would take a “massive positive event” to send Bitcoin to the moon.",12-Jul,2018
" Joseph Stiglitz: Not everyone is a fan of Bitcoin. Despite proclamations from supporters about its revolutionary technology and the “freedom” it offers its users, many are still not convinced. If you’re Bitcoin, it must not bode well for you to have a major critic in the form of Nobel-winning economist and Columbia Professor Joseph Stiglitz. Today, Stiglitz spoke with Financial News of his concern about the adoption of the unregulated financial asset which he believes elicits illegal behaviors as it has no central authority and its users can be totally anonymous. He has spoken to Bloomberg on several occasions before about his distaste for Bitcoin. The economist’s concerns center around the potential for criminal enterprises to take complete advantage of the network: “You cannot have a means of payment that is based on secrecy when you’re trying to create a transparent banking system…If you open up a hole like Bitcoin, then all the nefarious activity will go through that hole, and no government can allow that.” Despite his concerns, he believes that once the market is truly big enough, regulators will enforce rules which would render the coin useless. Currently, the cryptocurrency market is still considered small with a $273 billion market cap, though predictions have placed it nearer to $1 Trillion by the end of 2018. It Stiglitz opinion, the popularity of Bitcoin lies only with criminals and if “you regulate it so you couldn’t engage in money laundering and all these other [crimes], there will be no demand for Bitcoin. By regulating the abuses, you are going to regulate it out of existence. It exists because of the abuses.” Though not a Bitcoin enthusiast, Stiglitz isn’t swearing off cryptocurrency completely. He believes the US could benefit from a more open and transparent digital payment system in order to protect from the corruption that is experienced in our current financial system.  “I believe very strongly that countries like the United States could and should move to a digital currency … so that you would have the ability to trace this kind of corruption.” But what digital currency would be his preference? >>Facebook Appoints Director of Engineering Blockchain. Read it here!  “I’d like us to move more towards an electronic payment [system] but you don’t need a bitcoin for that,” Stiglitz does not stand on this ground alone; Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Jamie Dimon and Christine Lagarde have all expressed similar concerns or criticisms about Bitcoin.

" Last month, Bitcoin enthusiasts breathed a sigh of relief when they were informed that the Tom Lee Bitcoin price target was $25K by the end of 2018. But a month later, now in the second half of the year, Tom Lee has changed his mind. He now expects that Bitcoin will trade a little over $20,000 by year-end. As the Bitcoin bulls and bears continue to fight, the Fundstrat co-founder has sided with both in certain instances. He admitted that Bitcoin’s trading volume has dropped. He cut his Bitcoin price target. Yet Mr. Lee made it evident Thursday that this is not something investors should fret over. On Thursday, in an interview with CNBC, Lee said that he had cut his price target and expects to see Bitcoin at $22,000 per unit by the end of 2018. That’s 20% less than his previous $25K year-end projection. According to Tom Lee, this is OK. He said any return nearing his $20K forecast for the coin by the end of the year would be an increase of roughly 200%. In May, Bitcoin reached its most recent high, which was around the $9,800 price mark. Since then, BTC has lost roughly 30%. Despite this, Tom Lee believes that Bitcoin, as well as blockchain technology, are only in the “early stages” of their transformation. He even called them a “multidecade story.” Tom Lee appears to be undeterred. However, the new Tom Lee Bitcoin price target may have shocked a few people. Why? Because Lee has stuck by his $25K prediction through thick and thin – even when the Bitcoin price dropped during the 2018 Consensus conference. Are you worried about the slash to the Tom Lee Bitcoin price target? Or, do you share his view that Bitcoin is in the early stages of transformation, and a few thousand is nothing to quibble over? >> Malta: Parliament Approved Blockchain Regulatory Framework Featured Image: Twitter",5-Jul,2018
" Speaking on CNBC yesterday, Fundstrat’s Robert Slyumer has given his opinion on the BTC charts. He believes that the current Bitcoin downtrend can only be reversed if the coin creates a short-term break, through the $6,300 mark. The Bitcoin analyst studied the Bitcoin 15-day moving average charts from May and said: “It really is a no-man’s land from a trading standpoint. I think if you’re a very short-term trader… we have a critical stop level at the $5,800-6000… with a resistance level of $6,300-6400. If it can rally through that, I think there’s a chance Bitcoin could start to turn.” A 15-day moving average chart is a good indicator of market trends and can help forecast whether market trend is positive or negative. Slyumer looked back over Bitcoin’s 15-day moving average charts going back to 2017. These charts indicated that the crypto markets have shown progressively higher lows. A “very critical support” for the coin came at the $7,000 level this year and Slyumer focused on this point as a turning point. Because Bitcoin lost this support level and equally failed to cross the $7,800 resistance threshold on the upside, it created “lower highs” and began an overall downtrend. Bitcoin is currently defending the $6,000 level and is trading below its 15-day MA trendline for late 2017, early 2018. In Slyumer’s opinion, $5,800-$6,000 is now the “absolutely critical” support level for Bitcoin. If it fails to hold then the coin will decline further to the $5,000-$5,500 range. Until we see the coin holding above this support level then the downtrend is inevitably going to continue. >>Can a Bitcoin Airdrop Help the Humanitarian Crisis in Venezuela? Tom Lee’s prediction that Bitcoin will reach $25,000 this year will be a tough rally for the coin in Slyumer’s opinion: “At this point, we’re just seeing recovery rallies back to the 15-day, back to the downtrend, and it’s failing.”  Other major investors have also made similar predictions for Bitcoin price – notably billionaire Tim Draper who thinks the coin might reach $250,000 by 2022.  For now, though, Bitcoin is currently trading just under $6,100. The coin is down 9 percent from the beginning of the week. Featured Image: DepositPhotos.com/ANDRANIK2017",28-Jun,2018
" Can a Bitcoin Airdrop help the people of Venezuela? The country is considered one of the world’s most oppressive monetary states. Unfair practices implemented by its government to maintain control of its people has resulted in the following; “severe shortages of medicines, medical supplies, and food have intensified since 2014, and weak government responses have undermined Venezuelans’ rights to health and food. Protesters have been arbitrarily detained and subject to abuse by security forces.” — as reported by The Human Rights Watch World Report in 2017. But can cryptocurrency change all this? Developer John Wheeler is trying to make that the case. The former bank employee turned developer is working on a new project — getting Bitcoin into the hands of Venezuelan citizens. Teaming with Morgan Crena, the pair have formed a non-profit organization called the Pale Blue Foundation which is currently working to create a Bitcoin Airdrop. Through his foundation, Wheeler wants to use Bitcoin to change an economic and political crisis so severe that people can’t pay for necessities — food is in such short supply that joining lengthy food lines have become regular practice for citizens just trying to obtain the necessities. Prices for such necessities can also be exorbitant and routinely changed by the seller. There is no regulation. Wheeler and Crena’s mission involves a supporting team who are developing a mobile app called Azul. This app will hopefully draw millions of donations which will be transferred via a Bitcoin Airdrop to citizens of Venezuela. The project began as an idea batted around on Medium, but it is starting to take real shape; now, it is drawing help from Bitcoin companies including OpenBazaar and LocalBitcoins. But why Bitcoin? Crypto communities Zcash and Dash have also been long trying to help Venezuela in some way, but the team has focused on Bitcoin because they believe it to be the most widely available and resilient network with the ability to handle vast transactions. “We’re focused on bitcoin because we think it’s the most viable solution with the most worldwide potential,” Wheeler said. Bitcoin’s upcoming lightning network is also a key consideration for the technical design of the Azul App. Lightning is a layer-two technology which will solve scaling issues within the Bitcoin network, increasing transaction limits exponentially. The Pale Blue Foundation is currently in discussions with relative developers — lightning wallet developers CoinClip and the lightning startup ACINQ. With all the technicalities behind the mission on a roll and with the necessary bodies joining the fight, the team still needs to secure the funding that’ll buy the Bitcoin to be airdropped to Venezuelans. The initial hope is to secure millions of dollars from venture capitalists and donors; believers of the cause who want to join a “large-scale collaborative mission to help people suffering from financial tyranny.” >>Bank of England Warns Executives of Crypto Risk.

" A new Bitcoin ranking has been released, and the BTC position might surprise you. Don’t worry, it’s overall placement is still number one by market cap, but China released a new listing of its top blockchains and Bitcoin didn’t fare so well. Spoiler alert – Bitcoin didn’t even make the top ten. The China Electronic Information Industry Development (CCID) body initially released its blockchain rankings list in May. On the original list, Bitcoin (BTC) hadn’t made it into the top ten either, but it was close, coming in at lucky number 13 (the original list gave a three-way tie between Bitcoin, Verge [XVG], and Waves). Unfortunately for Bitcoin, when the CCID updated its blockchain rankings, the Bitcoin ranking was pushed back even farther. In China, Bitcoin is now ranked as the 17th best blockchain, hardly a gold star rating. (Verge moved down as well – to number 20 – but Waves actually moved up to number 11.) A lot of different factors need to be considered when attempting to rank blockchains, making the process no easy feat. Blockchain networks can be vastly different, with different elements and different goals that need to be considered, so it can be a bit tricky to compare blockchains. Certain blockchains are so different from one another that it would be silly to compare them. Among the most important things to consider when judging a blockchain network include its smart contracts, token, security, scalability, and more. Really, it’s a lot of stuff to mishmash together to come up with a ranking, and when thinking in terms other than market cap, blockchain rankings will no doubt vary considerably depending on who’s doing the ranking and what factors they are judging. China’s ranking took into consideration technology, application, and innovation, which is a pretty fair breakdown, but there’s still no information on how exactly the CCID judged the blockchains. Bitcoin was given a 41.6 for technology, 14.9 for applicability, and 35 for innovation. Its overall index from the CCID was 91.5.

" Jack Ma Bitcoin Bubble: Yet another well-known figure has come forward to express his thoughts on the cryptocurrency sector. The figure, who is Jack Ma, spoke specifically of Bitcoin (BTC) — and his thoughts weren’t exactly in favor of the cryptocurrency. On Monday, Jack Ma, a Chinese billionaire and the founder of Alibaba Group Holding, spoke at an event held by Ant Financial Services Group, a financial affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding. During his presentation, Jack Ma spoke of both cryptocurrency and blockchain. While he praised the latter, he had a few things to say about cryptocurrencies – specifically Bitcoin. According to Mr. Jack Ma, a Bitcoin bubble looms over us. This is not the first time the Alibaba Group Holding founder has expressed these thoughts. In the past, he has warned investors over the volatile crypto sector. The comments of a Bitcoin bubble come one day after BTC set a 2018 low. Right now, Bitcoin is selling for $6,317. This puts the coin up 6.46% in the past twenty-four hours. On the whole, Jack Ma didn’t call Bitcoin a bad thing. He provided the crowd at the Ant Financial event with reasons as to why Bitcoin has potential, but also why it is failing. As for the negatives, Jack Ma said Bitcoin itself is driven by speculation. For these reasons, the billionaire vowed to avoid the asset class. However, Jack Ma did have a few optimistic things to say on the topic of Bitcoin. The virtual currency itself may be sketchy at times, but according to the e-commerce giant, the blockchain technology behind BTC should be used to solve real-world problems. Blockchain – to Jack Ma and many others –  is the real winner. So is it fair to say that Jack Ma is team blockchain? I would say so. The comments of blockchain’s revolutionary potential come on the same day that Ant Financial (Ma’s affiliate) launched money transfers between Hong Kong and the Philippines. These transfers were entirely blockchain-based. Do you agree with Jack Ma? Is the Bitcoin bubble real?  Moreover, how do you feel about the newly launched blockchain-based money transfers? Is blockchain really the solution to real-life problems?

" After a wave of Bitcoin mining operations set up in areas with affordable electricity, places like Montana’s Missoula County needed to make a decision over the impact these operations have on the region. Earlier this month, it was reported that Bitcoin’s (BTC) energy footprint had nearly doubled in six months and was expected to grow. According to the study, Bitcoin could be using up approximately 0.5% of the world’s energy by the end of the year, almost the same amount used by the Netherlands. Needless to say, most people might not want that to happen. On Thursday, the Missoula County Commission decided to delay its decision over the suspension of Bitcoin mining to August 2018, according to the local news site the Missoulian. The hearing lasted nearly two hours where presentations and comments from the public were made on the topic of Bitcoin mining operations. Missoula County Commissioner Jean Curtiss had said at the end of the hearing that “we all understand that we don’t understand,” while County Commissioner Cola Rowley noted that this could be a good time for “education and outreach.” The county fears that the energy consumed by these operations could “pose a reliability and safety risk to local electric distribution systems, and affect electric rates for other customers” and that “the high energy loads could pose a fire hazard, and create electronic waste.” If approved, the decision would impose a one-year ban on Bitcoin mining and any new or expanding cryptocurrency activity. >>Did Tether (USDT) Really Manipulate the All-Time Price Highs of Bitcoin (BTC)? Other regions that have suspended Bitcoin mining projects include the Canadian province of Québec, who announced in March that it’s utility services provider Hydro-Québec will not be taking in any more applications for the development of mining operations. The demand for energy was beginning to exceed that supply that Hydro-Québec could supply.

" Tether (USDT) & Bitcoin (BTC) – A new study has surfaced this morning putting Tether in the negative spotlight once again. Last December, Tether was subpoenaed by the U.S Commodity Futures Trading Commission to provide proof that the digital currency was in fact back by a reserve of U.S. dollars. Bitfinex was also subpoenaed due to it losing banking relationships, but continued to remain operational. CEO of Bitfinex, JL van der Velde, spoke out against the accusations last year in an emailed statement and said: “Bitfinex nor Tether is, or has ever, engaged in any sort of market or price manipulation. Tether issuances cannot be used to prop up the price of Bitcoin or any other coin/token on Bitfinex.” Around this time, Bitcoin (BTC) reached its record high of $20,000 a coin, and these events are what prompted John M. Griffin and Amin Shams from the University of Texas Austin Department of Finance to investigate Tether’s movement. >> Is Day-Trading Ruining Bitcoin (BTC)? “Is Bitcoin Really Un-Tethered?” The 66-page research paper suggests that shows that Tether was “used to provide price support and manipulate cryptocurrency prices.” The paper claims that half of Bitcoin’s price rise within December 2017 was due to Tether and its issuer Bitfinex. The research paper says: “Using algorithms to analyze the blockchain data, we find that purchases with Tether are timed following market downturns and result in sizable increases in Bitcoin prices. Less than 1% of hours with such heavy Tether transactions are associated with 50% of the meteoric rise in Bitcoin and 64% of other top cryptocurrencies.” Griffin said in an interview that he’s “looked at a lot of markets” and manipulation in a market leaves tracks in the data. The data tracks with Tether are “very consistent” with a manipulation hypothesis. Griffin and Shams’s paper has been downloaded a total of 2,780 times today and currently has 7,645 abstract views. What will become of the research remains unknown at this time, but Tether (USDT) just passed DASH and Monero to become the 12th largest cryptocurrency by its market cap.

" Bitcoin day traders appear to be on the rise. The Financial Times reports that there is as much Bitcoin (BTC) owned by short-term speculators as there is by HODLers, or long-term investors, now. Blockchain research company Chainalysis discovered the Bitcoin data. This data shows that the amount of BTC held by day traders has increased to 5.1 million Bitcoin since December 2017. Bitcoin HODLers, people who have held BTC for longer than a year, together hold around 6 million Bitcoin. While these numbers aren’t quite on par yet, the chief economist at Chainalysis, Philip Gradwell, believes that this might be a “fundamental driver” behind the biggest crypto’s recent price decline. Gradwell explained that the growing number of Bitcoin day traders is causing a rise in liquidity for the coin, which could be part of what’s causing the Bitcoin price to drop. Other data discovered by Chainalysis should come as no surprise to most. Chainalysis also pointed out that a large amount of BTC is held by Bitcoin whales. Whales in crypto are typically large corporations or groups. There is around 17 million Bitcoin available and circulating. Of that, almost a third is held by only a few Bitcoin wallets. The Chainalysis data revealed that approximately 1,600 Bitcoin wallets each held about 1,000 BTCs, which, all together, would amount to around 5 million Bitcoin. This may also be affecting Bitcoin’s price. It’s very possible that the Bitcoin whales could be manipulating prices (for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies) to their advantage. If a whale sells some BTC, it’s enough to cause the price to drop, thus creating a chain reaction of FUD making others sell their BTC and making the Bitcoin price drop even further. Then, the whale(s) buy up even more BTC when the price is lower than they initially sold it for. This may or may not be happening, but there are concerns circulating that this could be the case.

" The launch of Bitcoin ETF’s could drive Bitcoin (BTC) price higher. Although the SEC has previously denied permitting Bitcoin ETF trading, two asset management firms have collectively submitted a new application to introduce regulated Bitcoin ETF’s (Exchange-Traded Funds). SolidX Management LLC and New York-based asset manager Van Eck Associates Corp said their new product would cover all the concerns that the SEC has highlighted in their previous denial.  “I believe that Bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios,” Jan van Eck, the chief executive officer of VanEck, said in a statement.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com The main targeted investors for this ETF are institutional investors rather than retail traders. This is due to the SEC’s warning that cryptocurrencies carry a higher risk for retail investors. The high price tag of $200,000 per share is an indication that institutional investors are taking interest in regulated Bitcoin ETF’s. SEC had also raised concerns about a lack of transparency on online platforms, which they believe are much easier to manipulate. The firms are now planning to introduce a trading desk for price data instead of doing all the business through online platforms.  What Would be the Impact of Bitcoin ETF’s on Crypto Markets?

" Planet Earth has overcome many challenges in its lifetime. Now it faces a new one: Bitcoin’s energy footprint. The challenge comes courtesy of a new peer-reviewed study, released on Wednesday, June 6, 2018.  Six months ago, Grist, an environmental magazine, wrote about Bitcoin’s energy footprint. Fast forward to June of 2018, and a new study has found that Bitcoin’s energy footprint has more than doubled since that article was first published. There’s more, though. The study also reported that Bitcoin’s energy footprint is likely to double again by the end of 2018. If this happens, Bitcoin will be eating up 0.5% of the globe’s electricity. For perspective, that’s roughly as much as the Netherlands.  Now, this information might not be new to everyone, but it’s likely to still have a shock factor. The author of the study, Alex de Vries, has posted these calculations before, but this is the first time Bitcoin’s energy footprint has been published in an academic journal. Being published in a peer-reviewed journal is important as it means the information included is true. No fake news. These articles go through extensive rounds of fact-checking and are written by credible sources.  By late 2019, the study found that Bitcoin could be using more electricity than all the solar panels in the world currently produce. This is roughly 1.8% of global electricity.  As concerning as this is, it’s not like it is new information to the world. Numerous countries, like Canada and Iceland, have openly stated that crypto energy consumption is getting marginally out of hand. Specifically, Iceland and Canada have spoken of too much energy being used for cryptocurrency mining projects. However, Iceland said that even though it knows the risks, it’s still going to put most of its energy towards the crypto sector.  This is a troubling trajectory. Why? Well, for starters, we are living in a world that should be restraining our energy use and fighting Global Warming. Instead, we are using more energy than we can afford to use, and it’s for something that not everyone can benefit from or wants to benefit from.  That’s just a few people’s opinions, though. What do you think? Speaking of Bitcoin, the virtual currency is still below the $8,000 mark on the market.

" Bitcoin (BTC) is a perfect store of value, but it’s not a Panacea that could solve all the global financial problems, according to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. Brad Garlinghouse – who previously predicted that only a few altcoins would exist in the next few years, now says Bitcoin doesn’t have the potential to become the global currency. The CEO, however, thinks Bitcoin will continue to work as the store of value; saying “We as a world have decided to store the value to the tune of about $130 billion… that’s a store of value. It’s hard to argue that.”  Source Image: firefox Although he claims that there is no competition among cryptocurrencies, he still believes that Bitcoin cannot compete with XRP as a means of transfer of payments.

Explaining his stance, the CEO said, “the Bitcoin blockchain, the technology that underpins the cryptocurrency, is “quite slow,” whereas XRP transactions are “a thousand times faster.” Bitcoin blockchain network on average takes 42 minutes for each transaction based on Blockchain.info record while XRP’s transaction stands in the range of four seconds.

" Bitcoin News: Bitcoin (BTC) obsession has been declining at a staggering pace since the start of this year; the largest coin couldn’t sustain trader’s attention and the confidence that it had attained in the final quarter of last year. Cryptocurrency market analysts are blaming declining trader’s interest for the bearish trend over the last couple of months. They believe Bitcoin needs substantial fundamental support to rebuild trader’s confidence, either from its network or through Wall Street investments.  Searches for Bitcoin plunged almost 75% since the start of this year – which isn’t a good sign for the price performance of crypto coins. Searches for Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are also down more than 70% in the past five months. Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, has shown his concerns on declining trader attention towards bitcoin and other digital currencies. The researcher said, “We use Google Trends to track search queries for ‘bitcoin’ as a proxy for potential new buyers,” Colas said in an email to clients Monday. “Bitcoin needs a new narrative in order to reestablish global attention.”  Nicholas Colas is certainly right about the cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin and the rest of the digital currencies failed to gain traders attention amid the lack of fundamental support. The co-founder of DataTrek Research further claims that he loves Bitcoin; saying “While we love the idea of Bitcoin (and own a little ourselves), we are not fans of buying it at current levels.” >>Monero & Tron Update – Below Expectations The market pundits believe that Bitcoin needs support from regulators all around the globe to strengthen trader’s confidence.

" According to Tom Lee, Bears aren’t accurately reading declining volume, tumbling Google search trends and prospects for the price crash. Indeed, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee believes Bitcoin is offering a strong buying opportunity for long-term investors, as he expects the largest coin to trade around $25K by the end of the year.  Bears emphasize that a decline in Bitcoin searches in Google is an indication of a lack of trader interest in digital coins. Bitcoin searches dipped almost 75% since the start of this year.  Tom Lee, on the other hand, believes that Google search trends aren’t a price performance indicator; saying “Google searches aren’t the leading indicator for Bitcoin, but instead, acts as a ‘coincident indicator,’ and therefore shouldn’t be looked to as some sort of BTC price predictor. Tom Lee admits that Bitcoin trading volume dropped 80% from December’s high. However, he says “December was the parabolic blow-off for Bitcoin.” He thinks such break out moments are always short-term and comparing trading volume to unusual trading activity isn’t a wise strategy for price prediction.  He said, “Compared to just the second half of last year, Bitcoin volumes are up forty percent. And compared to a year ago, [over] the same time (i.e., January to June), Bitcoin volumes are up nine hundred percent.”  Several stock market experts have been predicting a complete crash for Bitcoin and the rest of the digital currencies. They believe the lack of backing from real assets and regulatory pressures could kill cryptocurrency prices in the days to come. The huge price volatile also reduces its potential to work as a viable medium of exchange. Tom Lee has discarded these claims. He says – “Bitcoin mining cost will work as the floor in the case of a price crash. From the Bitcoin bear market in December 2013 to January 2015, Bitcoin bottomed at its mining cost.”    Featured Image: twitter",5-Jun,2018

Colas spoke to CNBC yesterday and states that he has yet to see new adopters wanting to buy Bitcoin recently, and with any new technology new adopters make it more valuable. Colas gives to reasons as to why investors should halt on purchasing the cryptocurrency. First, google searches are down over 90% since Bitcoin’s peak in December and second, Bitcoin wallet growth has slowed down since last year. With that being said, Colas believes that the sharp drop in December and January was the crypto ‘bubble’ popping, but he’s a strong believer in its structure and technology.

" Is Bitcoin (BTC) a real asset or bubble? This question is a continuous discussion. Economists and market pundits have been closely watching Bitcoin mania; some of them are comparing it to teh Dutch Golden Age Tulip Mania, while a few are showing confidence in its future fundamentals. The debate over the shocking Bitcoin price movement and its ability to exist for the long-term hasn’t settled up. Until now. Joost van der Burgt, policy advisor at Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, however, believes that Bitcoin is a bubble which is close to bursting. The advisor has explicitly explained his thesis using five key indicators: The market has already crossed the first three stages of the cycle as the economist thinks the Bitcoin bubble is currently in the fourth stage of the cycle. He claims the displacement stage started occurring during the early age of Bitcoin – which then changed into the boom phase last year. Explaining the boom period, he said, “The ‘boom’ phase is characterized by prices rising slowly at first, but then gaining momentum as more and more participants enter the market, fearful of missing out.” The advisor further believes that the rush of entering the market has forced traders to borrow money to finance their investments. He calls it “Euphoria” (stage three of the cycle) – which he believes occurred together with the boom stage. The market has already entered the profit-taking stage according to Joost van der Burgt. He says the massive selloff in Bitcoin price indicates that investors are capitalizing on gains that Bitcoin generated during the last year.  Bitcoin price is down almost 60% from the all-time high amid traders selling strategy. He further predicts that the market is likely to enter the final stage soon; saying “The subsequent ‘panic’ phase, should it come to that, commences when reality sets in and Bitcoin’s price would substantially crash.” >>Bitcoin Cash Price Watch – BCH/USD Holds Steady Around $1,100 The economist, however, confesses that his thesis might not be accurate and Bitcoin could become the real asset or global currency in future. He said, “Maybe Bitcoin is different than anything we have seen before, and maybe a decade from now its market capitalization will be sky-high as it attains the status of a new global currency.” What are your thoughts?

" Bitcoin Buying Opportunity?: Has Bitcoin price reached the bottom of the recent bearish cycle? Market pundits were predicting that Bitcoin price had hit the bottom of the bear run earlier this week when the coin traded at around the $7,000 level; saying the cryptocurrency markets are undervalued following the most recent selloff.    Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Buying during the dip and selling during the high has always been considered a smart investing strategy and Dan Morehead –founder of Pantera Capital Management, is a current advocate of this practice: “All cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now.

The selloff has pulled the total cryptocurrency market close to $300 billion, down more than 60% from the all-time-high it achieved at the beginning of the year.  The founder of Pantera Capital Management says that the market has reached the bottom of this year. He anticipates upcoming investments from Wall Street will push the prices higher in the next couple of quarters. “Many institutions are essentially buying the rumor [of potential SEC regulations] and selling the fact,” he said. “Getting invested now so that in three, four, five months when the institutional, quality-regulated custodians that we’re hearing about come online, they’ll already have their positions.” >>Mount Everest Crypto Stunt – the Craziest Thing to Happen in Crypto in May!

" Bitcoin (BTC) will eventually die: Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller gave interesting but pessimistic remarks which shatter Bitcoin’s price fundamentals. The Bitcoin price bull-run seems to have paused after increasing skepticism from economist and technical analysts; they continue revealing bearish outlooks for Bitcoin in both the short and the long-run.   Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Robert Shiller – who is a famous economist and early predictor of both the dot-com bubble and the housing crash, has revealed that Bitcoin will eventually die either in the next few quarters or a hundred years from now. He thinks that Bitcoin is akin to all other monetary forms that failed after being short lived. “Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work. That mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal.” Shiller wrote The Economist has presented two compelling and meaningful scenarios for the world’s leading cryptocurrency.  The first scenario is Bitcoin could change its entity entirely if it exists 100 years from now. Shiller believes that increasing innovations in blockchain technologies and digital coins could completely change its existing features in the following decades. “Bitcoin won’t look anything like it is today. It will have a different name, if it exists,” Shiller said Tuesday on CNBC’s. Bitcoin price could crash significantly in the short-term, according to Robert Shiller’s second scenario. He thinks Bitcoin price could lose 80% of its value in the coming days, as its charm is fading away and people are starting to ignore it.   Source Image: twitter.com Like many other big names in the global financial sphere, Robert Shiller also calls Bitcoin a “Bubble”, meaning it will eventually have a bad ending. The response to Shiller’s claim was mixed. Bulls, however, doesn’t believe in Shiller’s theory. They claim the economist’s theory is too vague considering the requirement of a long time-frame. Bulls also want more explanation regarding the factors that could kill Bitcoin price by 80% in the short-term.   Featured Image: Twitter",31-May,2018
" The substantial amount of volatility in Bitcoin price (BTC) is arguably the biggest factor hindering its potential for global acceptability. Retailers, restaurants, and even credit card companies refuse to support cryptocurrencies due to this price volatility. As a more-than-apt example, the cryptocurrency market cap gained $30 billion in the last twenty-four hours alone, after wiping off $150 billion in the previous three weeks.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Important investment figures such as Warren Buffett have refused to invest in cryptocurrencies due to the speculation surrounding price movement. Fed Officials and other influentials have also rejected Bitcoin’s potential to work as a viable medium of exchange, as it has no backing from real assets and is, as previously mentioned – very volatile.   Mr. Greenspan, a senior market analyst at eToro, believes Bitcoin price could take decades to achieve complete stabilization. Mr. Greenspan said: “I don’t think the volatility is going to go away any time soon, especially since we still have a lot of bitcoin ‘whales’ or people who are involved in bitcoin early on who have amounted a massive amount stockpile.  Source Image: twitter.com Market participants, on the other hand, are also blaming regulators for the price volatility. They believe regulators could kill the price volatility if they imposed hard rules that reduce unfair practices and price manipulation activities. But then the point of crypto was to be decentralized, so is this not a complete contradiction? Wasn’t an ideology of “no regulation” part of the thrill of Bitcoin? Combined with price volatility, increasing competition from other market players, including Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ripple (XRP) is making it hard for Bitcoin to achieve global acceptability. Answering the question of “how long Bitcoin price takes for complete stabilization?”, Mr Greenspan said, “Over time, if we are looking at decades into the future, once the adoption rate of bitcoin is normal and has reached full market penetration, which we are nowhere near at the moment, and once you see more distribution and more liquidity in the market, I believe we can then have a much more stable price fluctuation,” Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Tzido",30-May,2018
" Investors all over the world had credited Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital currencies highly, thanks predominantly to their backing from innovative blockchain technologies and the possibility to work as a viable currency. Market dynamic and investor sentiments have changed substantially however in the past few months; cryptocurrency mania now seems to be cooling down – despite a much higher adaptation than ever before for blockchain technology. Google Trends, for instance, shows a vast and constant decline of public interest in Bitcoin and other emerging cryptocurrencies. This is mainly due to the massive level of volatility in cryptocurrency markets. The speculation based price movement has also erased trader’s interest.  The BTC coin rose to an all-time high of $19,000 level at the beginning of the year before crashing to $6,000 on Feb 6. It continued the huge sideways moves in the following months. BTC price moved sharply higher earlier this month to around $9,900 before losing all the gains in last three consecutive weeks. The study from UK’s Warwick Business School, which is ranked at the first spot in the Financial Times online MBA program in 2018, shows that cryptocurrencies are not reliable saving instruments, even in the short-term. The demand is driven by past prices, or simple emotion, rather than by economic fundamentals, according to UK’s Warwick Business School findings.  Several researchers and market analysts are comparing Bitcoin and other digital currencies with the dot-com bubble. The only handful of internet companies had survived when the internet bubble burst in 2000. The study further reveals only a few cryptocurrencies will survive in the long-term, and it is difficult to tell which one would be the next Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).

" Will Bitcoin price (BTC) rebound this year? Bitcoin price traded in the red over the last three consecutive weeks amid downgrades from big names and price manipulation scandals. After losing billions of dollars over the past three weeks, the largest coin is now receiving strong support around the $7,000 level. However, traders are in doldrums as its becoming more difficult to predict where the cryptocurrency market will move from here.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Spencer Bogart, a partner at major VC firm Blockchain Capital and also one of the first Wall Street analysts to cover Bitcoin, suggests that traders should buy Bitcoin during dips. Although he presented a pessimistic outlook for the short-term, the analyst sees a sharp rebound in the third and fourth quarter of this year. Bogart expects Bitcoin price to extend its losses next month before bouncing back to $10K by the end of this year. Could Bitcoin trade lower? He says: “certainly”, but then added, “But I would bet Bitcoin ends at least above $10,000 in the year.” Bogart’s claim for the potential upside is based on higher institutional adaptation. He said, “The long-term thesis is very much intact… The institutionalization of Bitcoin is absolutely occurring…Every major bank is trying to do something in the space. Either they’re going to be offering Bitcoin to their clients, they’re working on a custody platform, or they’re opening up a trading desk.” While the Wall Street expert was bullish on Bitcoin’s price outlook, he recommended selling some altcoins that are overvalued. He believes shorting Cardano, IOTA, TRON, and NEO is a good strategy, but he was “neutral” on Ripple, Ethereum, EOS and Bitcoin Cash.  Source Image: twitter.com Spencer Bogart has highlighted a more conservative outlook then Brian Kelly and John McAfee – who both have been expecting Bitcoin price to make substantial gains, both in the short and long-term.

" Grant West, the 26-year-old Just Eat hacker, was sentenced to 10 years in prison after the trial -resulting from a massive scam he perpetrated in 2015 – has ended. According to reports by the BBC, the scamming process lasted just five months during which Mr. West was responsible for sending bogus emails to over 165,000 people pretending to be part of the Just Eat fast food chain. In the emails, he offered a £10GBP coupon to clients in exchange for filling out a survey about customer satisfaction with the services provided. However, the survey also required there to be personal data filled out that many did in the belief they were doing it confidentially.  (courtesy BBC) West subsequently compiled this data and sold it on the Deep Web to other scammers through the now-defunct Dark Market known as Alpha Bay. He used the pseudonym “Courvoisier” for this purpose.  (courtesy: BBC) According to official information, he was able to raise £2 million worth in crypto (approximately $2.6M USD) from the sale of the “Fullz.” After tracking him down, the police were able to capture him on a train from Ryll to London. Subsequent investigations concluded that there was no attack on Just Eat’s internal servers or systems; however, the losses caused totaled figures in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. When police Raided Mr. West’s House, they found an sd card with the details of at least 63,000 credit cards, £2 million worth in crypto, 500gr of cannabis, seven million email addresses with passwords, and the corporate information of more than 500 companies. >>Addicted to Crypto Trading? There’s a Treatment Centre For That! According to the judge, the operation was a “one man cybercrime wave.” His words about West’s actions were harsh: “When such inadequate security is confronted with a criminal of your skills and ambition it is totally unfit for purpose and worthless… This case should be a wake-up call to customers, companies and the computer industry to the very real threat of cybercrime.” Mr. West, who pleaded guilty to the charges, received a 10-year sentence, while his girlfriend, Rachael Brookes, 26, was accused of trying to sell stolen information taken by her boyfriend, received a community order after pleading guilty to unauthorized access of computer material.

" John McAfee – who is known for making big price bets, has presented a bullish thesis for the next cryptocurrency market rally. He predicts a few coins – including Bitcoin (BTC) and EOS (EOS) will achieve robust price growths next month,  before collapsing in July. Bitcoin price currently trades around the $7,500 level but John McAfee expects BTC price to trade at around $15,000 next month.  He also predicts that EOS price will hit $32 next month.  Source Image: twitter.com Bears, however, don’t accept his price bet, as he’s backed claim on Trump’s meeting with the North Korean president. He tweeted: “My algorithm is still predicting the meeting between two leaders, which could take place in Japan next month.”    Source Image: twitter.com Donald Trump, on the other hand, publically denied meeting with the North Korean President after his offensive remarks. He also told Kim in the letter, “You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used.” Bears say, that Donald Trump has called off the meeting, but if he meets with Kim Jong-un would John McAfee’s prediction be correct? and what would be the fundamental impact on the cryptocurrency market be? Its right that political stability always has a positive impact on investment markets, so the meeting between the head of the two countries could have the potential to create a 100% rally in price. On the other hand, the stock markets, for instance, plunged only 1% after Donald Trump refused to meet with North Korean President.  Source Image: twitter.com John McAfee, however, has previously revealed that he charges hundreds of thousands of dollars for each promotional tweet about cryptocurrency markets.

Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Technical analysts are forecasting the bearish trend will extend its momentum while trend makers and business icons are also presenting a bleak outlook for the entire cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrencies are the most volatile asset in the world, at least in this era. This is because everything is a possibility in this market; crypto coins have created such major rallies in the past, including last year’s rally – when Bitcoin price rose from $1,000 to $20,000. At the moment, however, the market is much more mature and traders are closely inspecting all the pros and cons of digital currencies. Regulator interference and bans from several countries have also wiped off the illegal trading volume – which accounted for almost half of the trading volume during last years bull-run. Tom Lee has totally based his price bet on speculation that institutional investors will push prices higher later in the year. He said, “I think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest, and they haven’t really come into crypto yet because there is still some regulatory uncertainty. But that sort of ultimate allocation into crypto as an asset class is going to be a powerful reason why bitcoin rallies.”  Source Image: twitter.com Market reaction to Tom Lee’s claims was mixed.

" Bitcoin Price Manipulation – The U.S Department of Justice just launched an investigation into whether traders are manipulating the price of Bitcoin and other digital tokens, Bloomberg reported this morning. The investigation primarily focuses on illegal practices that can influence the price of these coins, such as “spoofing” – flooding the market with fake orders to trick other traders into buying or selling. Another illicit tactic the DOJ is looking into is called ‘wash trading,’ which traders trade with themselves to create the illusion of volume. This tactic is prevalent in equity and futures markets. John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied market manipulation, told a reporter at Bloomberg, “There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading. It would be easy to spoof this market.” The DOJ’s investigation is still in its early stages and is following the country’s latest crackdown on various blockchain projects, in both Canada and the U.S. Cryptocurrency trading is fragmented in dozens of cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms across the globe, many of which are located in Asia and aren’t registered with the SEC or CFTC. The CFTC doesn’t regulate the trading of cryptocurrency, but if it finds fraud in the ‘spot market,’ it holds the authority to impose sanctions. Red Flags The Winklevoss Twins, who own the Gemini Exchange, conducted a surveillance of the digital coins being traded on their platform last month. The twins then urged other trading platforms to band together to potentially form a group that would ‘self-regulate’ the industry. It seems that the duo sensed the government oversight drawing near. Many market participants have alleged that cryptocurrency manipulation is rampant, and you can clearly see that by the hundreds of ‘pump’ tactics initiated a day. The question then that remains is – how do we stop it?  Not the regulators, or the government, but us, the cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors. Can it be stopped without these regulators intervening? Leave your thoughts in the comment box below! Featured Image: Canva",24-May,2018
" Bitcoin Price plummeted below the $8000 level today for the first time in last the last thirty-five days. The constant bashing from business icons and trend makers are the most prominent drivers for the steep selloff. Bitcoin price lost 20% of its value since it hit the $9,900 mark on May 12. The selloff is quite surprising for bulls as they were expecting BTC price to generate solid gains considering Goldman Sachs, NASDAQ, and Intercontinental Exchange are all now backing the coin.    BKCM founder Brian Kelly was also stunned by the market behavior. He believes the entrance of Wall Street into the cryptocurrency market isn’t a small event. Trend makers and remarks from influencers always have a substantial impact on investing markets. Stock market experts, business icons, and Fed’s officials have been expressing negative thoughts for the cryptocurrency market. Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, PayPal CFO and Ali Baba founder all have rejected the use of cryptocurrencies as the viable currency. Some of them have criticized crypto coins on higher volatility while others believe it doesn’t have any store of value. This is because they expect Bitcoin and other digital currencies might have a bad ending. A bearish outlook for Bitcoin price from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard’s added to the selling pressure. Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari has also banged the cryptocurrency market, saying it has become a “farce” due to unregulated chaos and escalating fraud.  Bulls have failed to defend Bitcoin price and the rest of cryptocurrency market. The entire market has been declining at a steady rate over the last two weeks, resulting in the loss of over 100 billion from total market capitalization since May 12. Although Bitcoin bull Tom Lee blames a lack of regularity clarity for the recent losses, retail investors are coming up with reckless claims. Featured Image: twitter",23-May,2018
" Joe Davis; Vanguard economist believes that Bitcoin price (BTC) will crash to zero, and it will never emerge as reliable currency. Bitcoin price remains range-bound after falling 15% from three months high of $9,900 level. The bearish trend has been receiving support from influential icons. The debate over the use of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange is also contributing to the sell-off. Bitcoin price trades around the $8,300 level today. Altcoins are in the red after a short rally at the beginning of the week.  The total cryptocurrency market hovers in the range of $380 billion, down from $465 billion it hit a few days ago.  Joe Davis, the chief economist for $5.1 trillion asset management firm Vanguard, thinks cryptocurrencies aren’t the alternative of fiat currency. His stance is similar to PayPal CFO and Warren Buffet – who already has rejected the possibility of using Bitcoin as the medium of exchange. The economist of the $5.1 trillion asset management firm warned investors that Bitcoin price is likely to crash to zero. He suggested investors keep their focus towards “tried and true asset classes”. He believes that allocating even a small portion of the investment portfolio to cryptocurrencies could turn out to be a big mistake. He said, “The investment case for cryptocurrencies is weak. Unlike stocks and bonds, currencies generate no cash flows such as interest payments or dividends that can explain their prices. National currencies derive their prices from the underlying economic activity of the countries that issue them. “ The economist further argued that cryptocurrencies could be used as a medium of exchange, but they don’t have a store of value. Although the majority of market participants believe the higher level of volatility in cryptocurrency prices makes it harder for the global community to use it as a medium of exchange, they think the market needs some time and more regulation clarity for complete stabilization.  Twitter users reacted strongly against Joe Davis arguments. Cryptocurrency followers are comparing Bitcoin and other virtual currencies with the early age of internet and the Dow Jones.

" Bitcoin price (BTC) is crashing instead of rallying: Bitcoin price has failed to generate gains for investors since Warren Buffett, and Bill Gates rejected the cryptocurrency markets two weeks ago. Bitcoin price lost almost $1,800 in the last two weeks.  Several other industry experts are also refuting bitcoin’s potential to work as an alternate currency. They believe the higher level of volatility makes it difficult for the general public to use it as the medium of exchange.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Bitcoin price crashed to the $8,000 level today. The New York consensus summit also failed to fuel any rally for the largest coin. PayPal CFO John Rainey has rejected bitcoin’s potential to work as the medium of exchange, particularly for merchants that have low margins on their trades.  Source Image: twitter.com Rainey claims that merchants usually have a 10%-15% margin on their products. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has the potential to create price movements of 10%-15% in few hours alone – this makes it difficult for merchants to accept BTC as the tool of payment. Talking about the possibility of accepting Bitcoin in future, the CFO said, “You could have something that appeals to consumers, but if merchants don’t accept it, it’s of little value. Right now, we don’t see a lot of interest from our merchants. But if it’s something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we’ll certainly support that.”  Source Image: twitter.com The market has been apparently supporting Rainey’s stance.

" The Bitcoin (BTC) bubble theory has resurfaced again, as the founder of world’s largest e-commerce platform, Alibaba, just announced his views of the world’s first digital token. Jack Ma Yun, Alibaba Group’s founder and executive chairman, spoke in a forum on Wednesday and spoke highly of blockchain technology, but expressed his doubts about Bitcoin (BTC). “There is no bubble for blockchain, but there’s a bitcoin bubble,” Ma said in a panel at the second World Intelligence Congress forum. Ma said he has been researching blockchain for years and highly believes in its potential to solve security, and data privacy. The founder thinks that blockchain can be used by everyone including individuals, corporations, and even governments. Ma expressed security a top priority for his company, as Alibaba conducts ‘trillions of transactions’ a quarter. Ma said: “Social networks may not need blockchain, but we are doing internet finance in which we process trillions of trading volume. We have to turn to blockchain, otherwise, it would be fatal.”  The company reported $39.9 billion in yearly revenue in its latest fiscal Q4 earnings release. Alibaba currently has 43 published blockchain patent applications, which is followed by Bank of America which has 33. Standing Ground Ma said he first saw blockchain as a privacy and security solution, but never thought to turn it into something like Bitcoin (BTC) to make money. Clearly, the founder doesn’t understand the need to break away from central banks and hasn’t read the official whitepaper. Ma is one of Asia’s richest men, and his latest attitude towards Bitcoin (BTC) highly resonates with the Chinese government’s recent actions. However, in an interview back in December 2017, the founder told CNBC Shanghai:  “I don’t know about Bitcoin at all. I’m particularly puzzled. Even if it can really work, the rules of global trade and the financial system will be completely changed… We have a team that studies blockchain, but Bitcoin is not something that I want to pursue. We don’t care about Bitcoin.” It seems that Ma has always felt this way about the digital token, and the e-commerce giant won’t ever see Bitcoin (BTC) on its platform. Well, never say never – we’ll see. >> Tom Lee Bitcoin Prediction Fail Featured Image: News",18-May,2018
" Bitcoin shows no growth: Bitcoin Price (BTC) hasn’t moved higher despite the Consensus Summit: Bitcoin price trades in the range of $8,300 today after briefly touching $8,800 level at the beginning of the week. The largest coin has posted losses in last two consecutive days. This downside move is contrary to analyst’s predictions who were expecting a strong rally amid the New York consensus summit. Indeed, Tom Lee – who has predicted Bitcoin price to reach $25K by the end of this year – failed to predict the price movement during the consensus summit correctly.  Tom had anticipated bitcoin price to jump from 10% to 70% amid Coindesks conference. The price movement in the last three days was also quite contrary to historical precedents. BTC coin grew almost $2,000 in the previous year’s conference call, and it had made similar strides in 2014 and 2015. Two consecutive days of downside strides pulled Bitcoin price to an almost four-weeks-lows on Wednesday before moving back to $8,300 today. Although several experts presented the bullish outlook for cryptocurrency market during the New York conference call, bearish remarks from the Federal Reserve President at the beginning of the call created the selloff in the crypto markets. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said cryptocurrencies are operating like non-uniform currencies – which, at least historically, been discarded and replaced in global financial markets. The president also believes that Dollar is in the better position to work as the leader in currency markets. Bullard said. “The dollar, on the other hand, is backed by a stable government with direct and sensical monetary policy and persistently low inflation — because of that, it can better achieve the goals and meet the needs of the market.” The selloff also received support from Bing’s cryptocurrency ad-ban policy. Powered by Microsoft, Bing is the second largest search engine in the world. Bing considers cryptocurrency ads to be harmful to their audience due to their unregulated nature. The Microsoft policymaker said, “Because cryptocurrency and related products are not regulated, we have found them to present a possible elevated risk to our users, with the potential for bad actors participating in predatory behaviors or scamming consumers.” Featured Image: twitter",17-May,2018

The cryptocurrency asset management platform, LedgerX, is launching the first Bitcoin (BTC) savings account that will be regulated by the Commodities Future Trading Commission (CFTC), reports Forbes. The goal of the Bitcoin savings account is to provide investors with a fiat-based yield on their Bitcoin holdings. This is done through a simplified version of a call overwrite. All an investor needs to do is choose the implied rate they want to earn and the number of Bitcoins the yield will be applied to. Then, they just need to submit these choices to the LedgerX engine that is already powering their Bitcoin options product. The LedgerX Bitcoin savings account has two CFTC licenses. One is the derivatives clearing organization (DCO) license, and the other is a swap execution facility (SEF) license.  The Bitcoin savings account was designed based on LedgerX’s customer use patterns – but it isn’t for everyone. The product was designed to appeal to long-term Bitcoin investors, those who prefer to HODL than to sell.

" You may have asked the question: is Bitcoin safe? on multiple occasions. Should you really think to put your money into Bitcoin? Well, Tim Draper is an investor with renowned opinions about the cryptomarket. He is an avid believer in the positivities of crypto and his bullish position has earned him many followers and detractors. On multiple occasions, his predicted forecasts have proved successful despite adverse scenarios, and this is something to take into consideration. A few years ago, Draper predicted that Bitcoin would increase by more than 10k, a figure that only a few believed possible at the time. His prediction was met in about one year. A month ago, Mr. Draper also predicted that Bitcoin would cost 250k by 2022. Quite a controversial and yet not impossible figure compared to Bitcoin’s previous performance over time. This Thursday, in an interview for CNBC, Tim Draper spoke about the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over the traditional FIAT system. For the well-known investor, one of the most important aspects is that of security. If his opinion is to be considered once again, then it would seem that Bitcoin is safer than traditional fiat currency: “Right now, your banks are being attacked all the time. The hackers are poking holes in your banks and going after your fiat money. And the bankers are pounding away trying to keep the hacks away, but they are getting hacked all the time. No-one has ever hacked the Bitcoin blockchain. It is the most secure place to put your money. And so, as a store of value, it is a great place to be. And if you’re in Argentina or Venezuela or Nigeria, you know that your currency is going to fall 30 percent every year, because, I mean, those countries tend to implode about every year. And people lose their fortune. Well, if part of your fortune is put into bitcoin, you’re not going to lose your fortune.” This statement is true, Bitcoin has never been successfully hacked but this still doesn’t make it infallible. Is Bitcoin Safe? Perhaps there could be the use of exchanges as trusted third parties to convert digital resources into cash — just like banks? However, there have been significant hackings into large exchanges resulting in multi-million dollar losses for investors, but this risk is equally there for standard banks. Hacking though in general, is caused by faults in the internal system of the exchanges, as well as by a security failure in the banks. Can it be really be considered a flaw in the actual economic system? For this reason, it is always recommended to store cryptocurrency in a wallet (preferably a cold one) to avoid security breaches inherent in the use of third-party platforms. Mobilizing accounts to exchanges is only recommended for trading, and once finished relocating the crypto to a personal wallet is always recommended. So with that added element – an outside wallet holding your bitcoin, Its fair to say that that makes Bitcoin safer, whether or not more than fiat lies on several factors. You can’t ask “is Bitcoin safe?” without considering another vital aspect that provides security to users; the decentralized nature of crypto. This characteristic means it is out of the control of third parties such as governments or economic influencers. “If you are in Argentina or Venezuela or Nigeria, you know that your currency is going to fall 30% every year because those countries tend to implode about every year, and people lose their fortune. Well, if part of your fortune is put into Bitcoin, you’re not going to lose your fortune.” This statement is critical because in these countries inflation exceeds the Bitcoin’s price volatility. Taking Argentina as an example, the country is so incapable of paying its debt that it had to issue 100-year bonds to try to alleviate the current crisis. A similar situation exists in Venezuela, where the State has stopped issuing official figures, and the calculations are based on figures published by news sites that claim to obtain their data from social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.

" Ethereum (ETH), and Bitcoin Cash could outplace Bitcoin (BTC) soon due to their superior technology and higher adaptations. Roger Ver – who has earned the moniker “Bitcoin Jesus” for his advocacy of Bitcoin from the early years, believes that Bitcoin could lose its leading position in the cryptocurrency sphere. He says cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) have better technologies and are well positioned to generate substantial gains in the days to come. Ethereum coins currently trade around $700 USD with the market capitalization of $69 billion. Its price and market cap is substantially lower than Bitcoin’s price of $9,000 USD and market cap of over $149 billion. Bitcoin Cash stands at the fourth spot in cryptocurrency ranking – with its price of $1,500 and the market cap of $24 billion. Although Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash price appreciated at a faster pace than bitcoin over the last month, both coins are still standing far behind bitcoin. Roger Ver says Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash will generate massive gains in the days to come compared to Bitcoins modest gains. This movement will allow ETH and BTC to outshine BTC. He said, “I see it happening, and I believe it’s imminent,” Mr. Ver told The Independent. “Ethereum could overtake bitcoin by the end of the year, and bitcoin cash could do the same before 2020.” The Bitcoin expert further claims that the Bitcoin blockchain technology offers slower transaction times and higher fees compared to several other newer technologies. The cryptocurrency market has seen the inclusion of more than 1,500 digital coins since Bitcoin’s commencement in 2009 and each cryptocurrency technology is trying to beat Bitcoin’s flaws. >>Bitcoin Price Drops Below $9,000 He further claims that utility of Bitcoin Cash would allow it to stand at around $100,000 USD in the future. He added, “It’s not guaranteed, but it is much more likely to happen than not. Bitcoin cash has more than doubled in value in the last month, and big investors are coming in soon could see it double again by next week. People love to chase a rising star.” Featured Image: twitter",11-May,2018
" Bitcoin price (BTC) plummeted sharply in the last two days following Bill Gates and Warren Buffett’s criticism regarding the cryptocurrency markets. The largest coin traded at around the $9,000 level early today, down almost $1,000 from Sunday’s high of $9,900. Altcoins fell at a high mid-single-digit rate in the last two days, pulling the total cryptocurrency market capitalization to the lowest level in the last week. Despite this, another Tom Lee prediction has surfaced. Bears are on top of the market as business icons have called cryptocurrency markets a “greater fool theory“. However, Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, predicts bitcoin price to rally 70% next week. The cryptocurrency market expert based his claim entirely on the upcoming New York Consensus Summit beginning May 14. Almost 7,000 blockchain and Bitcoin enthusiasts will take part in the conference. Tom Lee believes that these passionate players will optimize trader’s sentiments leading Bitcoin price to generate substantial gains.  “Already one of the largest crypto conferences in the world, attendance this year is up dramatically and coming at a time when Bitcoin/Crypto is down YTD. Hence, we expect the Consensus rally to be even larger than past years,” Tom Lee says. Is this Tom Lee Prediction a Fairy Tale? It will be quite tricky for bulls to create and sustain any rally that is based on speculations and bullish calls. Warren Buffett and Bill Gates have already criticized cryptocurrency markets on these types of predictions and artificial price hikes. Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency market need structural support to push prices higher instead of speculations. Market pundits are also raising questions on the topic of regulatory roles in cryptocurrency markets during the Consensus Conference summit – which they believe will have a negative impact on Bitcoin price. Tom Lee, however, believes that commentary surrounding regulation won’t hinder the rally saying: “While regulation is sure to be a topic of conversation, [I] don’t expect this to hinder, the impending rally.” Featured Image: Twitter",9-May,2018
" Bitcoin.com Controversy: Bitcoin Cash has taken things a little too far on its crusade to promote itself, A strategy that has led the ecosystem to a polarization never seen before in the history of the blockchain. While the relationship between ETC advocates and ETH could be described as controversial — two communities whose philosophies are radically different and are critical of each other — the relationship between BTC and its fork BCH is worse and now the lack of seriousness from camp BCH in their strategies has reached a limit. In recent weeks, the actions of Roger Ver – the man at the head of the BCH community, began listing BCH as Bitcoin which angered users. Ver, who owns Bitcoin.com has used the site to promote specific tactics that have been described by many as misleading. A few weeks ago, a community initiative began to gather momentum, seeking to sue Roger Ver for confusing users by listing BCH under the name Bitcoin, when in reality Bitcoin is BTC in all markets. Not only content with that, Ver decided to list the real BTC under the name Bitcoin Core, when Bitcoin Core is the name of the famous Satoshi Client and the original bitcoin wallet.   Because of actions like these, users disapproved of the way BCH adopters promoted the currency. As a result of the complaints, Bitcoin.com listed BCH as Bitcoin Cash and BTC as Bitcoin again on some parts of its website. However, four days ago when Twitter account @bitcoin called BTC “an experimental coin with no whitepaper”, it was the straw that broke the camel’s back, provoking reactions from important personalities like Mike Novogratz who responded in a very heated tone: Bitcoin Cash is the oldest cryptocurrency. Its white paper was published in 2008 and the genesis block mined in January 2009.  Bitcoin Core (BTC) is an experimental currency that does not have a white paper and has only operated under its current model for two years. pic.twitter.com/YBeepJlwC5 — Bitcoin (@Bitcoin) May 4, 2018  As a result of the Bitcoin.com controversy, Coinmarketcap, one of the reference sites when researching the status and characteristics of cryptos around the world, decided to remove Bitcoin.com from the list of official Bitcoin websites.  This was inevitable. Bitcoin.com is possibly the number one searched domain name when looking for information regarding Bitcoin – even more than bitcoin.org which is now the only official website. The kind of controversy that Bitcoin.com is stirring up means it doesn’t hold a neutral position regarding cryptos. This seems to warrant its removal from one of the worlds biggest crypto related platforms.  >>The New York Stock Exchange Has its Eyes on Trading Bitcoin Another reference website – CoinCall, listed BCH as the “shitcoin with the most market cap. The reasons for such a decision are explained on a popup: “intentionally misleading newcomers to believe it’s the ‘real’ Bitcoin, for example by misusing bitcoin.com and the @bitcoin Twitter handle.”  So far there have been no comments from Roger Ver or the bitcoin.com team. It is quite obvious that the Bitcoin.com controversy has ruffled industry feathers. However, it is important to note that Bitcoin.com is still one of the official forums for the most popular cryptocurrency on the market. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© mdkhalil1",8-May,2018
" Warren Buffet may still dislike Bitcoin (BTC), but many other big names on Wall Street seem to be warming up to the digital currency.  The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), has been working on an online trading platform that gives institutional investors access to buy and hold BTC. The New York Times reported late Monday that the plans are still ‘confidential’ and the four individuals that briefed the publication on the matter asked to remain anonymous. This news broke following Goldman Sachs’ grand announcement to be the first Wall Street bank to open up its own Bitcoin trading unit. May 3: Goldman Sachs says it will operate a bitcoin futures market. May 8: According to NYTimes, New York Stock Exchange, the world’s biggest stock market, is preparing a *proper bitcoin exchange* not futures. 2018 is looking more interesting!https://t.co/yd0WsTEjy2 — Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) May 8, 2018 ICE and Goldman Sachs aren’t the only big Wall Street hitters to enter into the crypto space recently. Nasdaq partnered with the large cryptocurrency exchange Gemini just a few weeks ago, to get its foot in the Bitcoin futures game. Even the long-time anti-Bitcoin bank JPMorgan has turned a new leaf. Back in October of last year,  the institution filed for a patent to use blockchain technology in its network payments. These moves mark a dramatic shift toward mainstream adoption for the digital currency. >> Goldman Sachs Bitcoin Futures Swap Contracts The NYSE-parent recently held various conversations with large US financial institutions about potential ‘swap’ contracts. In a swap, banks would buy a contract that would give one of its customer’s Bitcoin the very next day. According to the individuals working on the project with ICE, these contracts would be backed and secured by the exchange. While these swap contracts may seem more complex than just trading USD for BTC on an exchange like the rest of us; these particular trades come under the regulation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The swap trades operate clearly under the current laws, something exchanges have yet to do. Adena Friedman, CEO of NASDAQ, recently said her company would create a cryptocurrency exchange if the regulatory issues were ironed out by the U.S govt. What do you think about the latest news?

" The bitcoin expert and senior market analyst at eToro, Mati Greenspan, explained that Bitcoin’s behavior is completely normal and that after reaching historical highs of around 20k a drop like the one seen during the first quarter of 2018 was to be expected.  In an interview for The Express Mr. Greenspan mentioned that technical analysis better explains the reasons for the fall in Bitcoin prices than fundamental analysis. “I believe that more than fear of regulation that decline from the 20,000 peak was more of just a normal retracement.” Mr. Greenspan is a fervent advocate that markets move in trends and cycles, so a behavior as bullish as that seen during the last quarter of 2017 could only have a subsequent bearish after-effect. For him, this type of “retracement” had already occurred on previous occasions, to give rise to a greater bullish impulse later: “Whenever the price moves and jumps into a new order of magnitude, we need to see some sort of retracement on that. It’s the same thing that when it jumped up from eight cents to $3.50, then it had a retracement back to a dollar, that’s a very normal thing after that kind of leap. So if we look at it now, I believe we are about five or six percent up over the price a year ago.“ For Greenspan, expectations are very high. According to his comparisons, Bitcoin is in a better position today than in previous years, which “without a doubt” implies a reasonable probability that bitcoin will beat last year’s all-time high. According to technical analyses, bitcoin is showing a breakdown of what is known as a “triangle pattern” – a market behavior in which dips get higher up and peaks get lower and lower.   Analysts define the triangle pattern as a search for equilibrium, meaning that when this figure is broken, or when the apex is reached, the path taken represents a strong future trend. In the case of Bitcoin, it is clear that that the market’s behavior broke the triangle on an upward path. This could be a good start towards fulfilling the forecasts of Mr. Greenspan, who, despite his bullish statements, did not cease to be conservative, saying “I don’t know what’s going to happen in the future. I’m really not a fortune teller or anything like that.” Featured Image: Depositphotos/© mdkhalil1",7-May,2018
" Two months ago, Reddit dropped Bitcoin (BTC) as a method of payment. This was due to the increase in transaction fees. Now, however, it appears bitcoin may be returning to the platform. This isn’t speculation, either; the Reddit chief technology officer confirmed the news of bitcoin payments returning to Reddit.  On Thursday, Chris Slowe, Reddit’s CTO, announced in an interview that the site is planning to reinstate bitcoin as a form of payment. This option will be available to the platform’s gold members. There’s more, though. Slowe went on to say that Reddit is not just looking solely at BTC, but rather it is looking at adding more than one crypto payment option.  The other coins Reddit is looking at are Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC). Ethereum (ETH) is currently selling for $746.09, putting the coin up 9.71% in the past twenty-four hours.  Source: CoinMarketCap Meanwhile, Litecoin is also in the green, currently selling for $160.42. This puts the coin up 7.82% in the past twenty-four hours.   Source: CoinMarketCap Aside from a spike in transaction fees, Reddit has also cited the reason for the site stopping the bitcoin option to be because of its integration issue with Coinbase (Reddit’s crypto payments processor). Back in March, Coinbase turned off its Merchant Tool and replaced it with a Coinbase Commerce product. This is reportedly one of the reasons that ultimately led to the halt. The news is circulating around the Twitter universe, which suggests people are excited about bitcoin’s return. One crypto analyst even tweeted that this is an indication that the cryptovirus is spreading, writing “internet money for the win.” Others questioned the point, stating that we don’t know whether or not the fees will rise again (like they did in December) once people start using bitcoin heavily again. In response to the latter point, people reminded the user that Segwit was not implemented in December in the way that it is now. >>Goldman Sachs Launching Bitcoin Futures Contracts Soon What do you think of the news?

" Financial services company Goldman Sachs has announced its intent to launch Bitcoin futures contracts in the near future. Goldman Sachs launching Bitcoin futures contracts is a pretty big deal for the financial world. What made the investment firm take the plunge? New York Times reporter Nathaniel Popper wrote that Goldman Sachs plans to use its own money to trade Bitcoin futures contracts for its clients. The investment firm will also offer its clients its very own bitcoin futures products. “[Goldman Sachs] will also create its own, more flexible version of a future, known as a non-deliverable forward, which it will offer to clients,” continued Popper. An exact date has yet to be set, but Goldman Sachs said it will likely be occurring within the next few weeks. >> Bitcoin Hashrate Nears All-Time High Despite Market Skepticism Goldman Sachs isn’t the first big gun to launch a Bitcoin futures service. Back in December, Cboe Global Markets and CME Group both launched Bitcoin futures trading, on December 10th and December 17th respectively. Although both launches were a resounding success, the Bitcoin futures trading may have also, in part, led to the subsequent Bitcoin crash shortly after. Bitcoin has yet to fully recover from its crash, the coin now selling at $9,416.12 according to CoinMarketCap data (which is approximately $10,000 below its all-time high selling price achieved on December 17th). So why does Goldman Sachs want to get in on the Bitcoin futures action? One of the Goldman executives in charge of creating the futures operation, Rana Yared, told New York Times that “the bank had received inquiries from hedge funds, as well as endowments and foundations that received virtual currency donations from newly minted bitcoin millionaires and didn’t know how to handle them.” Yared continued, “It resonates with us when a client says, ‘I want to hold bitcoin or bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate store of value.'” Evidently, there were quite a few clients who felt this and so, ultimately, the decision to start Bitcoin futures contracts was approved by the Goldman board of directors. What effect do you think Goldman Sachs launching Bitcoin futures contracts will have on the market? Will it help to move Bitcoin’s price up? Or do you think another crash will happen? >> Why You Should be Aware of Cryptocurrency Market Fluctuations Featured image: Fortune",3-May,2018

" 16,000 Bitcoin – totaling just over $140 million – was sold by Nobuaki Kobayashi, a Mt. Gox Trustee, in a move that took an increasingly optimistic Bitcoin community by surprise. The move triggered some nervousness because a previous similar course of actions by the man known as “The Tokyo Bitcoin Whale” (the selling of 400M$ in BTC) was pointed as the cause of a bearish streak that ended with a fall in BTC prices of almost 40%. With similar precedent, negative opinions did not take long, including several media outlets rushing to sell the news, publishing a negative sentiments shared by some technical analysts. The correlation seemed obvious, so the results were to be expected. However, it is important to note that Mr. Nobuaki had previously talked about the situation, clearing up the doubts of many investors who practically blamed him for a global collapse: “Following consultation with cryptocurrency experts, I sold BTC and BCH, not by an ordinary sale through the BTC/BCH exchange, but in a manner that would avoid affecting the market price, while ensuring the security of the transaction to the extent possible,” Despite the series of massive sales that took place, the Bitcoin market remained stable, with a steady and relatively bullish trend holding it at around $9,000. Nervousness and volatility could not reverse market sentiment, which this time did not buy the news.  The reason seems to be the same one previously overlooked by analysts. Apparently, Mr. Nobuaki’s sales were made OTC, i.e., they are not reflected in the charts as they are made in batches and in a personal way, and not through intermediaries as is usual in traditional trading exercises. Trading over the counter is a less popular form of trading in which no trading records are produced. The parties personally buy, negotiate and sell crypto to avoid regulations, price deviations and any other type of alterations and barriers typical of traditional trade. Kevin Zhou, the founder of cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund Galois Capital, told Reuters that this is the ideal way to carry out large-scale operations like Mr. Nobuaki’s: “Generally, you would go trade through an OTC desk when you have a large block trade you want to do without moving the market too much or incurring too much slippage” This strategy is logical. In theory, Mr. Nobuaki could sell all his tokens at a certain price immediately without going through the “market sell” processes that would exhaust the buy orders causing a considerable drop in Bitcoin prices. The market remains calm; apparently, the period of nervousness has passed, and the bullish are gaining ground, especially in candles reflecting behaviors over the one day span, which leads to the conclusion that there is strong confidence in the behavior of BTC prices. This optimism seems to extend to the rest of the important altcoins that are having a positive correction Featured Image: Facebook",1-May,2018
" Warren Buffett has never shown himself to be a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Buffett still isn’t jumping on the crypto train. Buffett told Yahoo Finance that he doesn’t see Bitcoin as an investment. Instead, he believes it’s a gamble. He continued to explain that there isn’t anything wrong with that, per say, but that it’s important not to treat Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as anything more than a game. You can’t expect it to behave like an investment, because it isn’t an investment. Buffett explained: “If you buy something like a farm, an apartment house, or an interest in a business… You can do that on a private basis… And it’s a perfectly satisfactory investment. You look at the investment itself to deliver the return to you. Now, if you buy something like bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don’t really have anything that has produced anything. You’re just hoping the next guy pays more.” He continued to explain that “You aren’t investing when you do that. You’re speculating. There’s nothing wrong with it. If you wanna gamble somebody else will come along and pay more money tomorrow, that’s one kind of game. That is not investing.” Buffett’s stance on Bitcoin shouldn’t come as a huge surprise given his previous thoughts on the coin. >> Fundstrat Poll Shows Investors Believe in Bitcoin In 2014, Buffett likened Bitcoin to that of a mirage. He also compared Bitcoin to cheques: they’re both just ways of transmitting money. At the time he said that Bitcoin shouldn’t hold value because there were a number of ways money could be transmitted. Despite the advancements in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through the years, Buffett has little changed his tune. In January of this year, Buffett told CNBC that cryptocurrencies “will come to a bad ending.” Buffett is a crypto bear that never plans on buying Bitcoin. Do you agree with Warren Buffett on Bitcoin?

" As with any new technology and trend, there will always be prognosticators who want to explain to the masses what is going to happen in the future. This is even true of the economists and the pollsters. One has to take all of these with a seriously large grain of salt and healthy suspicion as the predictions are only just that and not necessarily reality. I only need to point you to the 2016 US presidential elections to show you how wrong the pollster prophets were. They still seemed to not have recovered from their bad polling.  So with Bitcoin, we will look at some of the price predictions and other predictions that may or may not be accurate. Part of the issue is that this technology is still on the low side of the bell curve of global acceptance. So basically, the herd has not caught onto it just yet.  Just to put a little perspective on this short article, it is going on the last full week of April 2018 at the time of this report. Looking at CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is priced at $8,879. Keep that in mind as we look at a few predictions for 2018 regarding Bitcoin.  Standpoint Research under Ronnie Moas has predicted Bitcoin to be at $20,000 per coin by the end of November 2018. This is doable, based on the understanding that the stock market is overpriced and the USD is devaluing globally. Of course, the tax cuts in the United States opening up growth in the American economy may not have been a factor that was considered, which could slow down the devaluing of the USD.  Mike Novogratz is calling for Bitcoin to reach $40,000 by the end of 2018. Mike is a serious investor in this space and has been investing in ICO. So his insight is valuable. It is based on a strong belief that institutional investors are poised to invest heavily in Bitcoin. This will pour a lot of needed capital into this technology and will be the vehicle to bring the price per bitcoin up substantially.  McAfee has predicted the wildest and craziest at $1 Million by the end of 2020. Maybe he was talking about Bitcoin Cash, we are not sure. Either way, that is quite a prediction and would be very cool if that happens.  As far as the number of holders of Cryptocurrencies, that number has been predicted to go up to approximately 50 million investors by the end of 2018. This is a global prediction by Yonatan Sela of Props. This would be the beginning of the wave of herd investors as this digital currency gains momentum.  The ability for the marketplace to see Bitcoin as a means of commerce rather than just a place to acquire an asset seems to be taking hold in 2018. It is not widespread that businesses will accept Bitcoin for example as a means of payment, but the prediction in 2018 is that it is trending. One of the craziest predictions we saw for 2018 is that Bitcoin will have increased use among online gambling to the point of even having short-term volatility insurance. So these are just a few of the wild predictions around Bitcoin for 2018. It is not just about price, it is about the number of investors going up, and the trend to have Bitcoin as the means of payment for more and more services, including gambling.  This is just a short list and we recommend that you look at Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in the following manner. Do not get too emotional about it. Just look at it as an asset to invest in, with the possibility that it will be a means of commerce in the future. Consider investing in Bitcoins or other digital currency after at least a minimal education on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency in general. Start out small with some discretionary, I can afford to lose it money and build from there. Remember that diversification of your investable assets is a truth that does not go away no matter what new assets or currencies come into existence. >> Check out CCN’s daily Bitcoin Price analysis here Featured Image: DepositPhotos/ albund",26-Apr,2018
" Bitcoin could become irrelevant if any of the ideas put forth by MIT students become a reality. First though, let’s go back to 2008 when the US went through the worst recession in history; it was even considered to be greater than the “great depression”. The cause of it ultimately came down to the banks issuing money/mortgages to individuals that they didn’t have and the housing market burst as a result. A year later, the still unknown Satoshi Nakamoto served the world an entirely new solution to the problem and Bitcoin was born. Nakamoto’s original whitepaper outlined a peer-to-peer electronic payment system. It removed the need for a financial institution to be the intermediary between two people when sending money to one another. Now almost a decade later, there are  24 million active Bitcoin wallets currently in use around the globe. Back in 2011, a single Bitcoin was worth around a dollar, but today, BTC is valued at just over $9,300. The coin reached its record-high of just over $20,000 in mid-December 2017 and grew 1,245% in 2017 alone. Despite its popularity, a tech writer at the world-renowned MIT – Morgan Peck, just proposed a scenario (or three) where Bitcoin could become irrelevant. Let’s take a closer look. The first scenario entails the government creating their own form of digital currency – dubbed “Fedcoins”. This is basically the same system we currently have, except everything is electronic. You would set up a “wallet” with the Federal Reserve or an affiliate bank, and you’d be able to buy the digital currency with US dollars at a one-to-one ratio. The nodes, or computers running the blockchain, would be updated by institutions approved by the federal reserve. An undergraduate at Yale, Sahil Gupta, explained that “these authorized nodes could be things like Bank of America, JP Morgan—basically, trusted institutions.” Gupta went on to explain how he believes the Fedcoins will be used: “I’d imagine people first get comfortable spending Fedcoin on things like groceries and movie tickets. As people realize it’s easier than cash, as businesses realize it’s cheaper than credit cards, and as banks realize it’s literally more secure, so goes the process by which dollars are phased out of the money supply, and Fedcoin phased in.” This isn’t a new concept; The Bank of Canada built a simulation for such a currency back in 2016. Sweden has also taken massive steps towards becoming a completely cashless country. Currently, the social media giant Facebook has over 2 billion active users. The second scenario describes a large platform persuading a large group of its members to branch-off and run its own proprietary version of the Bitcoin software. This can be done by way of a ‘hard fork’ at a certain block on the original blockchain. The new group would then start building upon the new blockchain with its own specifications and could build their own corporate coin. This happened last year with the creation of Bitcoin Cash. Peck describes another scenario that seems more plausible than trying to get a large group of individuals on Facebook to hard fork. First, Facebook would create its own third-party Bitcoin wallet and integrate it into its product suite. Peck explains: “For those who already use Bitcoin, the experience is so vastly superior to what they’ve previously experienced that they immediately migrate their funds to their Facebook wallet. Those who don’t yet own any bitcoins, or have never heard of them, could be given the option of earning some on the site, either by watching advertisements or by writing Facebook posts for others to see. For those tired of watching ads, you mix in another fun feature. In exchange for a clean, ad-free experience, users can choose to let Facebook mine bitcoins with their computer’s unused processing power.” Once Bitcoin has entered into the mainstream and is used daily by millions of individuals on Facebook’s product suite, the company could quietly fork and adopt a new version meaning hte original Bitcoin could become irrelevant. Most of these users would have no clue, and now Facebook could control every aspect of its own blockchain. The last scenario in which Bitcoin could become irrelevant, is one that is already unfolding. Peck describes it as the “tokenization of everything” and it involves the world transforming into a hyper-efficient barter system. Every company would release their own cryptocurrency and an automated system would allow individuals to trade each asset seamlessly. >> Martin Lewis Files Lawsuit Against Facebook Over Crypto Scams Cambell Harvey, a professor of Finance at Duke University, explained: “Think of this as an incredibly efficient barter system. Barter is generally inefficient, but if you have a network and you tokenize the goods and services and enable it with a blockchain, it can become very efficient. Without a network, you have to find the person that wants to trade four goats for the cow. That’s very difficult, to find that person. But with a network and with collateralization of blockchain-based tokens, it’s much easier.” Bitcoin could become irrelevant? Really? Could any of these ideas actually come true? Personally, I don’t think that any new system would completely “destroy” Bitcoin, but a new project emerging in the blockchain space could easily make Bitcoin irrelevant. The original blockchain is slow and expensive and sooner or later, it will be passed by another alternative cryptocurrency that can process thousands of transactions in a second, with far fewer fees.

" The cryptocurrency sector is a fundamental part of our world. Some people love it, others hate it, but that doesn’t stop the crypto wheels from turning. Now, it seems like every week someone new joins the conversation and expresses their own opinion on the crypto space. The latest to do so is Tim Draper, a venture capitalist.  On Saturday, at the Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, Tim Draper declared a very bold statement. He said Bitcoin will be bigger than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Skype, and Hotmail combined. Draper, who made early investments in the companies mentioned above, also said that Bitcoin is bigger than the worldwide web. In addition, the 59-year old venture capital investor said BTC is bigger than the Iron Age, the Industrial Revolution.  Is he right though? I will admit that it is quite the statement. Plus, it’s not like Bitcoin is a guarantee. The virtual currency is quite volatile. That being said, Draper certainly has experience in the financial world, so his reasoning probably comes from a logical place. The internet investor reiterated his statement Saturday that BTC will hit the $250,000 mark within the next four years. It sounds crazy, but Tim Draper isn’t the only one making optimistic predictions about Bitcoin. Thomas Lee has said time and time again that Bitcoin will reach $25,000 this year. Currently, Bitcoin is selling for $8,911.22, which puts the coin down 0.26% in the past twenty-four hours.  In a recent interview with CoinTelegraph, Draper essentially stated that the masses shouldn’t be surprised if Bitcoin ends up becoming the largest digital currency. Why? Because Bitcoin has what is deemed “a network effect.” As the coin grows in price, the network expands. That’s why Draper stated in the interview that Bitcoin is the leader in terms of cryptocurrencies.  Draper reiterated something like this on Saturday. He gave an example of what life will be like in five years time. Tim Draper stated that in five years when we try to purchase coffee using fiat currency, we will be laughed at. Again, why? Well, according to Draper, because we are not using cryptocurrency.  It’s difficult to say whether Tim Draper’s predictions are correct or not. To say that Bitcoin is bigger than the Industrial Revolution is quite something. But, the crypto sector has proven on a number of occasions that anything is possible. All we can really do is wait and see. I will say, however, that Draper may be onto something when he says Bitcoin will likely win the long-term crypto race.  Bitcoin currently has a market capitalization of $151,133,985,750.  Featured Image: Depositphotos/© olegkrugllyak",23-Apr,2018
" Bitcoin Price (BTC) is largely controlled by trader’s sentiments regarding the future fundamentals of cryptocurrency markets. Trader’s sentiments have been improving sharply in crypto markets over the last week, driven by bullish price predictions and regulator input to control unfair practices. Rather contrary to the previous precedent of “going against” government interference and regulation,  the management of Ripple (the third largest cryptocurrency), has invited the government to play their role in cryptocurrency markets. “We’re at that time now where we need more clarity and rules, and we need more certainty. It’s a good time to start revisiting that ‘wait and see’ approach taken by regulators,” Ryan Zagone, director of regulatory relations said.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com The cryptocurrency markets didn’t react sharply to the notices sent by U.S. Attorney General to thirteen cryptocurrency exchanges. In fact, bitcoin price moved above $8000 level again today after dipping to three day’s lows on Tuesday. Bitcoin price was under pressure yesterday due to the tax season, which is now officially ended. New York Attorney General Eric believes that cryptocurrency exchanges should clearly disclose basic facts about their operations. “With cryptocurrency on the rise, consumers in New York and across the country have a right to transparency and accountability when they invest their money,” said Attorney General Schneiderman in the release. Bulls are capitalizing on improving traders sentiments over the last week. Technical chart analysts are also adding to bull’s optimism. Moving averages and oscillators started showing positive signals for bitcoin price movement. Analysts believe bitcoin price movement shows the potential bullish trend considering Bollinger bands model. Technical analysts expect bitcoin price to hit the next resistance level of $8500 soon. Market pundits, however, are hoping bitcoin price to cross $20,000 levels in the days to come. They claim higher regulations will attract new investments from retail and institutional investors.

" Analysts are optimistic about the future of Bitcoin price: Bitcoin price (BTC) traded in the green during the weekend, and the largest coin added $1400 to its price last week.  The latest bull-run continues to receive support from bullish sentiments; bulls believe BTC price has hit the bottom early in the previous week and it is set to make a significant recovery. BTC price trades around $8000 mark today, up 14% in the last seven days.  Tim Draper, an early supporter of Tesla, Skype, and SpaceX, predicts Bitcoin price to hit $250K in the next four years.  Tim has 30,000 bitcoin in his portfolio, and he says he will never convert these coins for fiat money.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Brian Kelly Backs Tim Draper Opinion Brian Kelly, founder, and CEO of BKCM LLC, supported Tim’s prediction. Kelly said “it sounds crazy” to consider that BTC [Bitcoin] already had a 4,000 percent return over two years and a 3,000 percent return in four years may be a “continuation of the trend we’ve seen.” Brian Kelly, however, moved one step forward. He compared the bitcoin mania to Internet mania in late 80’s and early 90’s. He believes bitcoin is behaving like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) during the early days of the internet revolution.  He further added, “I think this technology is going to work, it’s going to be game-changing, but it’s very early days so that we can have this massive volatility,” The expert expects higher trading volume will allow the Bitcoin price to reach $250K in the next four years. Market pundits are blaming tax season, social media bans and uncertainty regarding regulators role for the vast bitcoin price correction during the last thirty days. Tax season is now almost over, and the new investments are flowing into the market – which is creating a bull run in crypto markets, analysts say. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization jumped almost $70 billion in the last four days, driven by 14% appreciation in Bitcoin value and a substantial contribution from altcoins.

" Bitcoin has revolutionized the world of finance. Its price is perhaps the most consulted aspect of the coin and at the same time (ironically) the least “revolutionary.” Over-volatility of price and unstoppable news of frauds and substantial investments have sparked a lot of debate and predictions; something that has become a popular conversational topic among hodlers and cryptocurrency enthusiasts. The community’s interest in these fluctuations is so high that exclusive memes and words have even emerged: Hodl, Lambo, moon, scamcoin, are the best known. Other jargons such as whale, buy the dip, weak hands, fomo, pump and dump, etc. have been adapted from different environments and are already natural to investors and fans on the cryptosphere. After the exponential rise in bitcoin prices, the strong bearish trend since January led to posts with more HODLS and fewer MOONS in social media. The financial authorities of traditional banking were busy cataloging the bitcoin as a bubble with some discouraging forecasts that did not help at all to reverse the trend. But it seems that the trend has bounced back after hitting the $6000 support level thanks to some announcements pointing to substantial investments in crypto by  giants such as George Soros, the Rockefellers, and Goldman-Sachs. From that moment on, the bulls began to gain strength in the economic game of crypto markets. One of the first to take the plunge with a value prediction was Tim Draper, a venture capital investor founder of Draper Associates, a VC firm with an investment portfolio of at least 80 successful companies including Tesla, Baidu, Coinbase, Bancor, Skype, Twitch and Robin Hood. In a rather striking act and with a market still bearish in the short term, he dared to predict a price of $250,000 by 2022. A figure that may seem exaggerated after such a sharp drop. However, Mr. Draper’s predictions do not seem to be very far from reality as they are gaining confidence and followers who trust in the possibility of the realization of this prophecy. One of those who has recently supported this prediction is Brian Kelly, Founder, and CEO of BKCM LLC. A company focused on crypto investment. In an interview for CNBC’s “Fast Money” show, Melissa Lee (host), asks Mr. Kelly for his opinion of Draper’s predictions, which may sound crazy to the public, to which, he responded with a tone of confidence “It sounds crazy, but think about it this way: That’s 4 years from now, that’s a 3000% return from here -which again sounds crazy- but over the last two years bitcoin had a 4000% percent of return. So, now again, it’s parabolic, but it would just be a continuation of the trend that we’re seeing” For this type of trends to occur, Brian Kelly says it requires an increase in the volume of transactions: something that large institutional capitals could promote, contributing in turn to lower volatility: “If the number of transactions […] catch up a bit, then I do think we’ve bottomed here, and I do think we’ve got a sustainable bull run ahead of us.” When asked about his “Personal forecast,” Brian Kelly seems to agree with Tom Lee’s prediction: “We can get transaction volumes up again. Then, there’s no reason why this couldn’t be at 20-25 thousand by the end of the year again; we can make a new high.” Featured Image: twitter",16-Apr,2018
" Can you imagine traveling to a different country solely with the purpose of buying something? That’s what a man from Malaysia just did – and it went horribly wrong. It might have been better if the man was going to Singapore for a shopping spree, but he wasn’t. The man went to Singapore with the intention of purchasing a wad of Bitcoins, and instead, he found himself at the center of the latest Bitcoin scandal. Here’s what happened. On Thursday, reports surfaced from various local mediums which stated that two men were arrested in Singapore. The charges? Being the masterminds behind the latest Bitcoin scandal. That is if you consider what the two men did to be a “scandal”. According to the reports, Mr. Pang Joon Hau flew from Malaysia to Singapore solely to purchase Bitcoins. Not only that, Mr. Pang flew to Singapore expressly to purchase Bitcoins with cash. $365,000 to be exact. Mr. Pang, who was assaulted along with his broker, had set plans to meet with two Bitcoin brokers. He was scheduled to meet them at his hotel on Sunday, April 8, 2018. Things didn’t go as planned. Both men are said to have assaulted Mr. Pang and fled with the cash – all $365,000. As unfortunate as this incident may be, one cannot help but think of how uncommon it is for people to transact the digital currency in person. It is for these reasons the police in Singapore have decided to launch an investigation into Mr. Poon. According to various reports, the Singaporean police will be focusing on why Mr. Poon came to Singapore (aside from the purchasing of the currency) and where Mr. Pang obtained this kind of cash in the first place. Singapore has been reasonably vocal when it comes to the cryptocurrency sector. It is one of the many countries to have called for more regulation on digital currencies, with Singapore making the call on February 6, 2018. >>Can Blockchain Help the Data Crisis? Not Likely – Here’s Why. Of course, this isn’t the first Bitcoin scandal to surface this year. It’s definitely not going to be the last, either. At the start of 2018, a famous cryptocurrency blogger, Pavel Nyashin, was robbed in his own home after bragging about the wealth he obtained from cryptocurrency. Nyashian had 24 mln rubles in cash stolen from a safe that sat in his home. Meanwhile, regulators in Texas warned the public today of a potential “widespread fraud” in the cryptocurrency sector. As for Bitcoin (BTC) itself, the virtual currency jumped by $1,000 in one hour yesterday. This caused Thomas Lee, Wall Street analyst, to come forward and say he still believes Bitcoin will hit the $25,000 mark. Featured Image: twitter",13-Apr,2018
" Notorious American venture capital investors and long-time cryptocurrency bull, Tim Draper, has just set an astronomical prediction for Bitcoin (BTC) by the year 2022. Yesterday, at a blockchain party held at his self-named Draper University in San Mateo, California, he predicted that the world’s largest cryptocurrency would reach $250,000 a coin. The video can be seen below.  Tim Draper’s 2018 Bitcoin Prediction is $250,000 by 2022 (live stream) from Bitcoin    In the video Draper says: “I’m thinking $250,000 a bitcoin by 2022. Believe it. They’re going to think you’re crazy but believe it. It’s happening, and it’s going to be awesome!” Serious winds (of change) at our block (chain) party last night. Predicting bitcoin at $25k by 2022. — Tim Draper (@TimDraper) April 13, 2018 While this may seem a bit crazy, given the bear market the past few months Draper has a fairly good track record of predicting Bitcoin’s price movements. In 2015, the VC mogul was right when he predicted that BTC would reach $10,000 by the end of 2017 because it soared past $13,000. With that said, market observers aren’t taking his bullish forecast lightly. Draper holds an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from Standford and has an MBA from Harvard, coming from a long family line of venture capitalists. Blockchain is the Future Draper isn’t just keen on digital currencies but believes blockchain technology will completely transform and revive finance, healthcare and various other industries. He spoke to the San Mateo Daily Journal about blockchain and said: “The blockchain is one of the most transformational technologies that has happened in the history of the world, and it is totally worth celebrating,” he said. “We look forward to lots of crypto fun and excitement from the event.” Draper isn’t the only billionaire eyeing the blockchain technology, the Rockefeller family, whose worth is around $1 trillion, have partnered with Coinfund to aid blockchain-based start-up companies. The Rockefeller family isn’t interested in turning short-term profits but sees this as a long-term investment in blockchain technology. The entry of Old Money into the cryptocurrency and blockchain space is another sign that blockchain is here to stay. >> Tom Lee Predicts BTC to hit $25,000 Featured Image: Silicon",13-Apr,2018
" Early this morning, Bitcoin (BTC) jumped by $1,000 in just one hour and the crypto bulls are coming in hot now. One crypto bull, in particular, Wall Street analyst Thomas Lee, believes that Bitcoin could rise to as high as $25,000, reports CNBC. Lee told Futures Now that “We still feel pretty confident that bitcoin is a great risk-reward and we think it could reach $25,000 by the end of the year.” Lee, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat, was noted earlier in stating that the U.S. tax season would cause a mass crypto selloff. By now, with taxes due April 17th, he says that much of the selling pressure has begun to ease off. (Could this be another reason for the crypto market green that we’re seeing today?) >> Indian Crypto Exchanges Consider Relocating in Response to Indian Crypto Ban Bitcoin is currently selling for $7,693.79, which puts the coin up 11.36% in the past 24 hours. To reach Lee’s predicted price of $25,000, BTC would have to grow another 225% by the end of the year. In one year, since April 12th, 2017, Bitcoin has grown by 541%, so it’s certainly doable, but the question is, will it? From the start of this year to now, Bitcoin’s price has dropped by 45%, according to CoinMarketCap data. This means that Bitcoin will have to recover by that much and then some in order to reach Lee’s estimated price of $25,000. Although Bitcoin has been spiralling downwards since the start of this year, since its inception in 2013, Bitcoin has grown by 5,586% overall. According to Lee, it’s time for Bitcoin (BTC) to recover what it has lost since achieving its all-time high back in mid-December. “It’s overdue,” Lee told ‘Futures Now.’ “Bitcoin was incredibly oversold. When you look at metrics like price-to-book, which is ‘money cost,’ or our bitcoin misery index, it’s pretty much what you saw at the end of the 2014 bear market, not the start.” Do you agree with Thomas Lee?

" The Bitcoin Bubble is popping… this time for real… because Bank of America says so. For the 278th Time. Bitcoin is not only the king of cryptos but also the king of bubbles. According to Bloomberg, a study by Bank of America Merrill Lynch on the behavior and evolution of Bitcoin’s prices places it as the most significant asset price bubble in history. The study compares the price trends of bitcoin with other similar phenomena such as the U.S. stock market in 1929 crash in the Stock Markets, the Mississippi Company, and South Sea Company in the 18th century, the behavior of gold pricing, and the famous Dutch Tulip bubble.  The graph attempts to show that of all the bubbles, bitcoin is the one that has achieved the most significant growth in the narrowest range of time. Whereas the most critical bubbles such as tulips have a value of less than 40x increase in value, the graph shows an increase (in a similar timeframe) of at least 60x for Bitcoin. In the last few months, the Bank of America has been very attentive to the behavior of bitcoin, and while just a few weeks ago they told the SEC at about the danger that Bitcoin posed to the expansion of their financial services, today their research results do not seem to contrast with their previous assessments. Such claims are not new to the world of Bitcoin: 99Bitcoin has kept track of how many times the media has “killed” Bitcoin, and with 278 “deaths” registered since 2010, an average of almost three rumors per month is more than enough reason to show that it is not always necessary to believe what the powerful say. Just as an example, let’s look at the behavior of Bitcoin prices today:  That looks pretty “Bubbly”, right? In weeks BTC has lost almost 60% of its value!… And the trend does not seem to stop Before we forge a response, let’s look at a bit of a similar graph:  This graph, as you can see, shows a previous BTC price fluctuation. What is happening now is nothing new, it has already occurred (and in worse proportions), and it is merely part of the natural behavior of an asset that is being capitalized, and that is not only being inserted into the market but is radically changing it. It is unfair to make such decontextualized comparisons, so let’s put things into perspective a little and analyze this graph.  Bank of America research is either decontextualized or charged with the subjectivity of an institution that studies a phenomenon considered “risky” for its existence. On social networks, the community has expressed some opinions. A notable example is Blockchainchick who made a comparison of Bitcoin with the opinions spread towards Amazon; a company that has been able to demonstrate its successful career despite the FUD that it suffered during its consolidation. Bitcoin has arrived in the world of finance to stay. Although the future is not written, the confidence of the users and the massive adoption will put a number on its future price; confidence can easily be damaged by third-party opinions (Pump and Dump, anyone?). However, if there is one thing that characterizes the community of crypto users it is that despite the nervousness they may have in the short term, there is always unity and optimism in the paradigm shift that cryptos can achieve… and that is perhaps the best reason to prove that Bitcoin will be bullish soon. I, personally, prefer one bitcoin over one tulip. Featured Image: Twitter ",11-Apr,2018
" Barclays compares Bitcoin to infectious disease: The investment bank Barclays likens the spread of the Bitcoin (BTC) to that of an “infectious disease” spreading, reports Business Insider Australia. Barclays analysts based their findings on the models that epidemiologists use to track diseases. The models were compared to Bitcoin’s price swings from the past seven years. The analysts were checking if there were any connections between how an infectious disease spreads and how Bitcoin has performed in the past to see if they could predict any of Bitcoin’s future. The results were surprising. Barclays stated: “We developed a theoretical model of an asset price with a pool of speculative investors and compared it with actual Bitcoin price behavior to see what it might imply for the future dynamics. The model has clear parallels with compartmental models of the spread of an infectious disease in epidemiology.” Barclays says this connection is why Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are slackening off now. Back in December, when the crypto hype was at its highest, prices swelled. However, like a spreading infection, it can only continue growing for so long. >> Bitcoin Wallet Supporting Lightning Network Removed from Google Play They explained this reasoning further: “As more of the population become asset holders, the share of the population available to become new buyers – the potential ‘host’ population – falls, while the share of the population that are potential sellers (‘recoveries’) increases. Eventually, this leads to a plateauing of prices, and progressively, as random shocks to the larger supply population push up the ratio of sellers to buyers […] prices begin to fall. That induces speculative selling pressure as price declines are projected forward exponentially. Analogously, this occurs with infectious diseases when the immunity threshold is reached; ie, the point at which a sufficient portion of the population becomes immune such that there are no more secondary infections.” So, essentially, growth (spread) will stagnate because there will be no one left to ‘catch the cold that is Bitcoin,’ if you will. Is this the stage that we’re in right now? “Unlike past peaks in Bitcoin prices, the survey evidence, based on our modelling, suggests that the speculative bubble in crypto currencies may have passed its peak,” stated Barclays. Do you agree? Bitcoin is currently selling for $6,830.23, which puts BTC down 66% from its all-time high in December, according to CoinMarketCap data.

" Well, that was fast. ‘Eclair’ – the first Bitcoin wallet supporting the Lightning Network, has been removed from the Google Play store, mere days after being added. Not long ago, on April 4th, a French tech company called ACINQ added the first mobile wallet that allowed for Bitcoin transactions via the Lightning Network. The app was available through the Google Play store for Android devices fitted with the operating system version 5.0 and higher. Several days later, on April 7th, the company tweeted they had lost the signing key for the wallet. This essentially means they are unable to update the app. We just discovered that we may have lost the signing key allowing us to update the app Note: key isn’t compromised, just was accidentally deleted and isn’t recoverable — ACINQ (@acinq_co) April 7, 2018   This effectively prevents us to patch the app in case of bugs, and we already have suspicion of a bug related to unilateral closing, that we wouldn’t be able to fix if it is confirmed — ACINQ (@acinq_co) April 7, 2018 >> Three funny blockchain chrome extensions that will make you smile The result was that the company removed the app from the Google Play store.

" Bitcoin (BTC) price has been facing stiff resistance from bears in creating a sustainable rally above the $7000 mark over the last week. BTC price crossed the $7500 level during Wednesday trading before plunging back to $6600 on Thursday; the coin trades around $6700 today and the market pundits envisage BTC price to make further price corrections.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Bitcoin and the rest of digital currencies are purely falling on declining trader’s confidence in crypto markets, due to regulators crackdown and analysts concerns over the fair value. London-based Capital Economics succinctly explained the difference between cryptocurrency and the stock market selloff. The firm said, “We expect equity markets to fall as investors cotton on to the fact that rising U.S. interest rates will slow economic growth. But the main factor driving down the price of bitcoin is likely to be a realization that it is simply not a credible long-run alternative to conventional currencies.” Along with rebuffing the link between crypto and stock markets, London-based Capital Economics also raised questions over the underlying value of bitcoin. The firm calls bitcoin ‘worthless’ and expects BTC price to fall significantly from its current level. It’s undoubtedly true that bitcoin doesn’t have any fair value to support its price on exchanges; the cost of mining each coin stands below $1000 in some countries – which depends mainly on electricity prices. Bitcoin gained substantial momentum last year only on speculations and the massive growth in trading volume from criminal activities. Research reports revealed that criminal activities accounted for half of the bitcoin’s trading volume during the final quarter of last year. BTC price plunged more than 45% in the first quarter after analysts started raising questions on its underlying value and anonymity feature. Featured Image: Twitter",6-Apr,2018
" Bitcoin price has already lost more than 60% of its value from its all-time high and analysts expect BTC to make a further price correction before the coin completely stabilizes. Warnings and price crash predictions from analysts along with bans from big banks and social media platforms have significantly impacted cryptocurrency trader’s sentiments. Bitcoin price recovered slightly from the lows of $6,500 that it hit during the weekend; BTC trades in the range of $7000 today after a death cross pattern failed to create any significant impact on price.  Analysts, however, expect bitcoin to fall another 50% in the days to come before creating a sustainable uptrend. Steve Bellotti of Digital Currency Holdings believes BTC price could hit the $3000 level, representing a decline of 50 – 60% from its current level. Steve Bellotti, also thinks that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will present better buying opportunities in the days to come. He said: “So, if you are patient, you are putting capital to work, this is a great opportunity versus right in December right before Christmas time where there was an awful lot of hype in the market, a lot of new retail customers joining every day etcetera and that has been taken out of the market. “So I think the market is much safer to enter into today. But we may not be at the extreme bottom yet,” he added. Reports of scams, frauds and illegal activities involving cryptocurrencies have shattered traders confidence in crypto markets over the past few months. Followed by an advertisement ban, Google announced a prohibition on crypto-mining browser extensions that are available for its ‘Chrome’ browser.

Bulls are of the opinion that regulators scrutiny and advertisement bans would help crypto markets to streamline their operations, driven by regulators potential to vanish criminal activities and price manipulation techniques. Jack Tatar, the co-author of “Cryptoassets, said, “while recent bans on cryptocurrency advertising by Facebook, Twitter and Google hurt prices short term, they could legitimize the space.” Regulators role is turning vital in enhancing crypto markets credibility after reports of scams, frauds, and thefts in the last couple of months. Regulators all around the globe are asking cryptocurrency exchanges to get a registration certificate or expect a crackdown on them.

" Bitcoin Price Crash: Bears have been holding onto crypto markets over the last couple of weeks, with negative reports and increasing regulatory concerns. The selloff intensified in the previous two days when technical factors also started showing bearish trends for Bitcoin price and its future fundamentals. BTC price crashed at a double-digit rate to a 50-day low on Thursday, and the coin extended the decline into Friday trading. Bitcoin price is down more than 40% since hitting $11,700 early in March. Bitcoin price traded around $6,700 in early trade before paring some losses. The market capitalization of largest coin fumbled to $114 billion.  Technical factors on the price charts impacted Trader’s sentiments. Its 50-day moving average cut the 200-day moving average from the top, creating a long bearish trend for the price. Technical analysts predict a huge crash in bitcoin price after its 50-day MA collides with 200-day MA from above. Analysts say, “when you couple Death Cross trend with the fact that bitcoin has been trending steadily lower since the launch of futures, I think that it is a major negative.” Bulls, on the other hand, still of the opinion that cryptocurrency markets are on the verge of significant rebound – which would be similar to late 2017.   Brian Kelly said: “Bitcoin, just like the spot FX markets, follows technical’s closely. Therefore these support levels gain more importance. If these levels hold, then it will confirm the uptrend from August is still valid.” >>Ripple, Cardano, and NEM: Which Coin Lost the Most Since 2018 Started?

" Bitcoin price plummeted sharply today after trading in the narrow range of $8,000 level on Wednesday. The latest selloff isn’t due to ads bans, regulators clampdown or warnings; the downtrend was purely supported by traders concerns over the technical factors on price charts – market participants are predicting a massive crash in BTC price in the days to come, driven by a Death Cross trend. Bitcoin price declined more than 7% today, down 15% in the last seven days. TV analyst Abigail Doolittle said, ‘the “death cross” trading data for bitcoin, suggests that we could see bitcoin go all the way back below $1,000 per bitcoin”.  Source Image: bitcoincharts.com A death cross trend happens when the 50-day moving average (MA) cuts the 200-day MA from the top – suggesting a considerable drop in price based on technical factors. Bitcoin price chart clearly shows that the 50-day moving average is likely to cut the 200-day moving average from the top, which is creating a long-term bearish pattern for BTC price. “That being said, any time the 50-day crosses the 200-day, it should flash a warning…and when you couple that with the fact that bitcoin has been trending steadily lower since the launch of futures, I think that it is a major negative,” Jim Iuorio of TJM Institutional Services said. Jim Iuorio’s concerns look undoubtedly true considering declining trading volumes and declining trader interest. Cryptocurrency markets are fumbling sharply over the last two months on regulators concerns and the use of digital currencies in illegal activities. Regulators all around the globe are creating their framework to get better control of crypto markets. >>Bitcoin (BTC): Wall Street Says HODL and Abra CEO Says Boom The U.K. has recently formed a task force to look at the pros and cons of cryptocurrency markets, while the U.S. regulators are also inspecting crypto markets to come up with strong rules and trading guidelines. However, the market participants aren’t yet sure how the new regulations would impact cryptocurrency prices. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© znm666",29-Mar,2018
" There’s no denying that panic has swept through the crypto sphere as of late. With the crypto ad bans by major companies like Google, Facebook, and most recently Twitter, prices of cryptocurrencies have taken a beating as many people believe this to be the end. Have no fear, though, because this isn’t the end. Crypto will recover, and it will continue. People are still interested in the space. Just ask Wall Street or Bill Barhydt, the CEO of Abra. CNBC reported that a Wall Street analyst is for HODLing Bitcoin (BTC). Wall Street analyst Thomas Lee took a stock investing approach to Bitcoin and said that it is an “attractive buy.” Lee’s approach is that only a few days in the entire year account for the overall return on investment for something like Bitcoin: “The reason ‘buy and hold’ (or HODL) makes sense for BTC is that a handful of days each year account for the bulk of gains for BTC. For instance, in 2017, a total of 12 days represent the full-year return of BTC.” That means that if you’re looking to make a profit on Bitcoin, you need to HODL, through the good and the bad, to capture those days. However, can a stock investing approach really be applied to Bitcoin, when it’s been around for far less time than the decades-old stock market and is way more volatile? With less data to work from, it’s harder to generalize results. Be that as it may, Lee’s reasoning is something to keep in mind for those inclined to panic when Bitcoin drops.  Lee’s argument essentially comes down to this: be patient and HODL through to the good days. >> Ripple (XRP) joins forces with blockchain consortium Hyperledger Those good days may be approaching fast, according to Abra CEO Bill Barhydt. Abra runs a global digital wallet app where you can buy, store, and invest in up to 20 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. In an interview with Business Insider, Barhydt claims that Bitcoin is in store for another price rally – and soon. He believes that once institutional investors, like hedge funds and asset managers, start exploring cryptocurrency, Bitcoin prices, along with the rest of the crypto market, will recover. “That’s going to happen this year I think,” said Barhydt. He explained his reasoning: “I talk to hedge funds, high net worth individuals, even commodity speculators. They look at the volatility in the crypto markets and they see it as a huge opportunity. Once that happens, all hell will break loose. Once the floodgates are opened, they’re opened.” >> Coinbase adds ERC20 support – altcoins to come? Barhydt pointed out that the December crypto price rally of last year corresponded with Japanese financial institutions investing in cryptocurrencies. He believes this will happen again once the West gets going. “There really is zero large-scale institutional money from the west in crypto right now. That is happening in Japan. Once a large sizable chunk of Western institutional money starts to come in — watch out.” He also believes that the regulation currently cracking down on cryptocurrency markets will actually end up encouraging institutional investors to move into crypto. In a more regulated space, more institutional investors will want in, fearing loss and scam less. Already, there is evidence of some institutional involvement in crypto. Mark Yusko, the founder and CIO of Morgan Creek Capital, announced that the firm is looking to raise as much as $500 million to start a new crypto and blockchain exclusive hedge fund. The game CryptoKitties recently received $12 million in funding from a group of investors including Andreessen Horowitz. So all this panic, it may be for nothing. What do you think?

" The cryptocurrency markets are in doldrums, and rating agencies are correlating them with different bubbles and scams that global markets had faced in the last few decades. Morgan Stanley strategist Sheena Shah sees enormous resemblances between the cryptocurrency market behavior and the dot-com bubble – the only exception being the 15 times higher growth in bitcoin price. Sheena Shah has based its prediction on following assumptions:  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com Undoubtedly Morgan Stanley’s strategist is certainly right. Shah has outlined several key factors that are similar to the dot-com bubble. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are moving on speculation, and their trading volume continues declining with sideways movement. It’s also true that increasing trading volume doesn’t suggest higher trader interest; the higher volume could also be an indication of higher selling activities.   “Rising trade volumes are thus not an indication of more investor activity but instead a rush to get out,” Sheena Shah said. However, the strategist didn’t look at the price performance of NASDAQ after the dot-com bubble burst. NASDAQ recovered steadily at the beginning of 2003 following a two year of downward trends. NASDAQ currently stands around 7344 points, significantly higher from the 5000 points NASDAQ had hit during the peak of the dot-com bubble. In case of cryptocurrencies, it’s too early to predict the future price performance of bitcoin and other digital currencies. The market forces have refused to consider them as a medium of exchange and an alternative currency, and they have several valid reasons to support their denouncement – the lack of fair value is amongst the biggest reason for their criticisms.     Featured Image: Twitter ",20-Mar,2018
" Analysts and market participants aren’t yet able to create the price prediction formula for cryptocurrencies; the market forces are divided on how these new assets will perform– some are calling for steady price growth, and others are seeing the price to fall to zero. Meanwhile, the idea of correlating cryptocurrencies with Giffen goods seems to be undoubtedly true. Giffen goods are products that people consume more when prices are higher, contrary to the demand and supply principle. Cryptocurrencies drive higher demand and interest when its price increases while the demand for digital currencies declines with the decay in prices. The demand for cryptocurrencies increased substantially in the final two months of last year when its price was soaring at a robust pace. However, regulators interference and harsh comments from market forces pulled back Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital currencies from their all-time high; the decline in prices has also lowered trader’s interest towards cryptocurrencies. Google trends show that searches for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies tanked by 80% to the lowest level in the last five months, while total confirm transactions are declining at a strong pace over the previous two months. Traders lost their confidence in cryptocurrencies after regulators, and key market players strongly criticized them on various grounds, including the lack of underlying value, failure to work as a medium of exchange and its uses in illegal activities. Followed by Facebook and Google, Twitter has also been planning to ban cryptocurrency related ads; they believe the unregulated cryptocurrency ads are harmful to consumers. >>Bitcoin Price Watch – Returns to $8,500 Bitcoin price regained momentum on Monday after hitting $7000 level on Sunday; the uptrend in price was supported by a statement from G20 Financial Stability Board chairman – who believe cryptocurrencies aren’t in a position to threaten the financial stability of the world. FBS members are likely to talk about digital currencies, but the chairman had ruled out the establishment of new regulatory policies for crypto markets during the summit.

" On March 9, 2018, documents distributed at the tenth creditors’ meeting of the infamous exchange, Mt.Gox, went public. They revealed a series of multi-million dollar sales of Bitcoins.  According to the documents, its bankruptcy trustee, Mr. Nobuaki Kobayashi had claimed to be the author of those sales. The document with Kobayashi’s textual words read as follows: “Between the 9th creditors’ (September 27, 2017) meeting and this creditors’ meeting (On March 7, 2018), with the permission of the court, I sold a certain amount of BTC and bitcoin cash (“BCC”) that belonged to the bankruptcy estate. The quantities sold and the amount paid into the bankrupt trustee’s account are shown below.” The multi-million dollar sales coincided with the exact time that Bitcoin prices fell the most in recent months. According to a Reddit forum sales were made from a series of wallets traceable to Mt.Gox which resulted in, or happened curiously close to, the largest and most atypical bearish candles of the month.  However, while some consider the impact to be strong, other research says otherwise: According to Coin Telegraph there is no reason to become alarmists: “The data shows us that Kobayashi’s actions were not as significant to the price of Bitcoin in the short run as some individuals believed they were. That being said, the amount of cryptocurrency under Kobayashi’s management could have the ability to create a panic that causes investors to sell off their cryptocurrency – especially if they get a glimpse at a sell wall created by Kobayashi.”  After an intense debate, marked above all by Mr. Nobuaki’s secrecy, the silence was broken. In a document published on the Mt.Gox website known as Q&A regarding 10th Creditors’ Meeting Report, Mr. Nobuaki answers a series of questions relating to the sale of cryptocurrencies, with a special focus on his multi-million dollar sale of BTC and BCH. According to the report, the whale denies any responsibility for the fall in bitcoin prices, as it mentions that sales, in addition to being made separately and in quantities that did not cause sell walls, had other characteristics that would give a minimal impact to the price of bitcoin: He also mentions that his trade was not impulsive, but rather that he had expert advice on the subject (without specifying who these would be). Similarly, although the previous paragraph checks the cooperation with an Exchange, it should also be noted that the sales did not use this type of platform to be completed. He didn’t give any more details about these transactions: “Following consultation with cryptocurrency experts, I sold BTC and BCC, not by an ordinary sale through the BTC/BCC exchange, but in a manner that would avoid affecting the market price, while ensuring the security of the transaction to the extent possible. Therefore, I believe that the sale of BTC and BCC by us did not affect their market prices.” If his words are right, the bearish behavior may be natural, but he is already beginning to have critics who think that Mt Nobuaki is just defending himself. Fair practice that could give Holders peace of mind that their investment won’t fall as a result of some manipulation. In the end, everyone is free to make their interpretations, but the truth is that it now becomes easier to make an objective statement when one can know the trustee’s approach when negotiating.  ",19-Mar,2018

" No other asset across the globe has shown more volatility than cryptocurrencies. Crypto markets are substantially responsive to market reports, and they can add or wipe billions of dollars off the board in a single day alone – forcing Bitcoin (BTC) investors to keep an eye on the price charts several times a day to see where their investments stand. “With other speculative investments, like private equity and venture capital, you can’t check your phone every five minutes,” Jim Smigiel said. With cryptocurrencies, “you’re able to track the minute-by-minute value of it.” Bitcoin price lost close to $2000 since the start of this week following reports regarding increasing crackdown and advertisement related ban from Google.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies fell as low as $309 billion on Thursday, down significantly from $390 billion at the beginning of the week. The market capitalization currently hovers around 325 billion, down more than 60% from the value it hit at the beginning of the year. The price volatility extended on Friday; Bitcoin and the rest of top ten virtual currencies regained some momentum after hitting the one month low of $7,700 on Thursday. Though there wasn’t any supportive news for digital currencies, the prices are increasing on speculations that the price has found support below $8000. Though the market opinion is divided about the future of cryptocurrencies, some analysts believe BTC prices are likely to crash below the $6000 level after the corrective rally – they have based their opinion entirely on technical aspects of the BTC price chart. “When sentiment is this weak, the market is increasingly ’fire, ready, aim’ — meaning, any headline today is likely to trigger selling,” Fundstrat analysts including Tom Lee and Robert Sluymer wrote. Market dynamics are getting tougher for crypto markets following increasing concerns over the scams and illegal practices using cryptocurrencies. French regulatory authority has blacklisted 15 cryptocurrencies and crypto-asset websites. The Central bank of France has already denounced to accept cryptocurrencies and issued a warning to their citizens. Similarly, regulators from the U.S. and other major countries are implementing new rules – which could significantly slash trading volume in the days to come.

" Despite the cryptocurrency market taking a serious beating the past few months, the U.K has just announced some big news. Coinfloor, a London-based cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it would be starting its own bitcoin futures exchanged named CoinfloorEX. This new exchange will offer bitcoin futures “at scale” through their own specific contracts and operational controls. The futures contracts are available to traders, hedge funds, and miners. CoinfloorEX claims they will offer the first “physically delivered cryptocurrency futures contracts”, designed specifically to protect investors from price slippage on positions at the time of settlement. The settlements made by CoinfloorEX will be based on physical delivery rather than the index price that’s across all other exchanges, which in turn provides true pricing transparency. >> Day One of Crypto Madness The company goes into further details in the official statement saying: “Access to Coinfloor’s spot exchange enables investors to easily convert Bitcoin to Fiat currency post-physical delivery, creating opportunities for longer-term currency appreciation or through meeting Bitcoin-denominated obligations.” The development team behind this project is taking security as a top priority, which is necessary given the number of hacks that have occurred as of late. The security of the exchange is underscored by a 100 percent multi-signature cold storage cryptocurrency custody facility. This aims at completely safeguarding client portfolios from theft and other security issues that occur when storage assets are held partially or fully online. An additional feature they are adding monthly audits of the Bitcoin balances, which gives ease to the investors to assure CoinfloorEX has enough Bitcoin liquidity to manage the high market fluctuations. These futures will be launching sometime next month, despite the downward price of Bitcoin currently. Will the announcement and spread of the news, help drive up the price of Bitcoin like it did when the U.S announced their futures? Whatever happens, this is still great news for the cryptocurrency market, despite its recent slaughtering due to Google banning crypto relative ads. Featured Image: Krypto",15-Mar,2018
" The anti-virus software pioneer John McAfee has presented bullish assumptions in favor of Bitcoin price (BTC) – John McAfee thinks BTC could hit $1 million level by 2020. Though the anti-virus software pioneer had several reasons to support his bet, he also suggests investors invest only the money they can afford to lose – which signifies that he isn’t too confident in its price prediction strategy. John has based its price target estimate on four key factors: He further believes BTC price to increase at the rate of 0.4840957034310259% per day to attain the price target of $1 million. John McAfee assumes the price will rise daily at this rate, and calculating a compounded rate for the remaining number of days until December 31, 2020. While John has highlighted several relevant facts that could support the price, he has neglected regulators role in crypto markets along with several other aspects, such as underlying value, criticism on its usage from criminals and the adaptation as an alternative currency.   Regulators will play a key role in settling the price for cryptocurrencies; they are taking steps that could wipe off billions of dollars from crypto markets. Based on research reports, criminals are accounting for almost half of the trading volume – which is at risk following regulators strategy to play a meddler role. Major players had rejected to adopt currencies due to its lack of underlying value; they consider digital currencies as speculative investments. Bitcoin, Ripple and other cryptocurrencies aren’t backed by real cash assets such as gold or foreign exchange; these coins mined through specific techniques and distributed to the general public. The market opinion is divided on the behavior of digital currencies and the time will tell how accurate John was in creating bullish bet. Featured Image: Twitter",13-Mar,2018
" Cryptocurrency trading is an emerging market that has been growing and capitalizing at a breakneck pace, but it has atypical behavior when compared to traditional markets. It is not uncommon for currency traders to use adopted ForEx market indicators such as MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Indicators or Fibonacci’s Retracements, but the truth is that many of these methodologies were created for traditional markets and may not be entirely right for crypto-trading. This has led many economists and “old-school” investors to see investments in cryptocurrencies more as a gamble rather than a real capital investment.  However, this seems to be changing, with the emergence of specialized studies, which have led to improved trading strategies. One that has emerged recently in blogs and news sites is the one created by the well-known Bitcoin Strategist and strong bullish investor Thomas Lee: the Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI) Although the methodology applied or the mathematical formula for its determination has not been disclosed, the indicator seeks to explain the market’s feeling regarding bitcoins ownership and how motivated a person would be to sell what he has. According to MarketWatch: “The Bitcoin Misery Index is a measure of consistency in the price of the No. 1 digital asset, bitcoin BTCUSD, +7.07% over the past 90 days, using the end of day performance (up-day or down-day) and volatility. In other words, it is a measure of momentum in the asset, equivalent to an oversold-overbought indicator. Market technicians often gauge “overbought” or “oversold” conditions based on measures of price momentum.” The results are given on a scale of 0 – 100, where 0 is “absolutely miserable” (bitcoin holders are “absolutely” willing to give away all their bitcoin) and 100 is “absolutely happy” (where no price in the world would be enough to motivate bitcoin holders to sell their coins). Of course in economics, the “absolute” signs indicators do not exist, but it’s easy to conclude that in general terms, Tom Lee developed an indicator, which analyzes the behavior and characteristics of the bitcoin to produce a more accurate result than other similar indexes. The indicator created by FondStrat’s owner shows a negative result. That is to say, the lower the number, the bigger the misery /, The bigger the number, the lower the misery)  In the world of trading there are already other similar indicators such as the RSI (Relative Strength Index) which, as stated by Investopedia “compares the magnitude of recent gains and losses over a specified time period to measure speed and change of price movements of a security” , and the MACD which is “a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of prices”. Investors often use these indicators in an attempt to find areas where trend shifts allow them to raise money, either by buying cheaply and then selling expensive in front of a bullish trend or by selling at the start of a bearish trend to buy more goods with the same amount of money. “When the bitcoin misery index is at’ misery’ (below 27), bitcoin sees the best 12-month performance,” Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Thomas Lee said in an interview with CNBC “A signal is generated about every year.” Right now the indicator has a result of 18.8, its lowest since Sept. 6, 2011. And according to an interview with Thomas Lee,“The last four times this was below 27… there was not a single instance with bitcoin not up 12 months later.”  When comparing the results with the traditional indicators, you can see that right now is an excellent time to invest in Bitcoins. All signs point to the same results. After the price manipulation resulting from an atypical selling of 400 Million Dollars by Mt. Gox Bankruptcy Trustee, Mr. Nobuaki Kobayashi, prices should return to their natural behavior.  According to a report published by Forbes “Lee’s Bitcoin Misery Index may be more useful than the traditional RSI and MACD indicators for Bitcoin since he has compiled some additional information to go along with his analysis. Also, Bitcoin’s price was relatively low until 2017, so RSI and MACD may not have enough historical data to be as accurate vs. when they are applied to securities having a longer track record. That being said both the RSI, the top portion of the graph below, and the MACD, the bottom portion, indicate that Bitcoin is in a bit of an oversold condition.”  >>Mt.Gox Bankruptcy Trustee sells $400million USD in BTC; Causes Market To Drop Almost 40% So remember: “Do not invest more than you can afford to lose” but in case you do have money to invest, check out the Bitcoin Misery Index and take advantage of the ‘misery’ of bitcoin holders now and (very likely) profit by the end of the year.

" Those who have been into crypto trading for some time must already be familiar with the constant fluctuation in token prices. The price variation of Bitcoin in the last three months alone is a virtual roller coaster; the price was $8k in November, 20k in December (19898.8$ to be more accurate) but then back to $9k in January. Such level of risk has generated a universal mantra in the community: “Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose”. However, since the crypto market is still a growing niche, with a constant number of new adopters every day, it is still difficult to make predictions although for now, the future looks promising. It is precisely this accelerated growth that has made it possible for so many people to make a profit uncomparable with any other investment. Some early adopters have even become millionaires without doing absolutely nothing more than waiting (or HODL). These people who for one reason or another have large amounts of money (or some token as the case may be) are known as “whales” and have the power to manipulate the market. Have you ever tried to buy a token and come across a “wall” that prevents you from buying it at a reasonable price because someone has placed an enormous purchase order for a price lower than yours?…  Did you see the order magically vanishing shortly afterward? This is known as a buy/sell wall. Equally, the actions taken by these whales affect traders globally, since when they sell or buy orders as a result of their massive operations, prices can skyrocket or plummet in a matter of minutes. In February someone bought almost 400 Million in Bitcoin, generating an increase of nearly 50% in its overall price.  His operations stored on an address which today has more than 92000 Bitcoins, had a positive result for the WHOLE market, thanks to a rebound in the price trend. On March 6, 2018, the Bitcoin reached a historic low, touching the $6000 mark. No one knew the apparent reason, but with the publication of an official report by Mr. Nobuaki Kobayashi, Bankruptcy Trustee of the now-defunct Mt. Gox, clear explanation arose for those who could make the figures: “Between the 9th creditors’ (September 27, 2017) meeting and this creditors’ meeting (On March 7, 2018), with the permission of the court, I sold a certain amount of BTC and bitcoin cash (“BCC”) that belonged to the bankruptcy estate. The quantities sold and the amount paid into the bankrupt trustee’s account are shown below” These operations totaled approximately U. S. 402,797975 million dollars according to the Google Exchange Rate of 1 Japanese yen = 0.00937 U.S. dollars The report concludes with a few words that explain the speculative behavior of every trader and the influence that a whale can have on the markets. “I made efforts to sell BTC and BCC at as high a price as possible in light of the market price of BTC and BCC at the time of the sale.” A Reddit user was able to track the movements made with the conclusion that the selling was not “gradual” but very quick instead. This led to an abrupt drop in Bitcoin prices that were reflected in a bearish trend for most of the other altcoins. Twitter user Matt Odell correlated the movements with bitcoin behavior. Results speak for themselves.  However, we have to wait. The crypto trading system must be taken very objectively in order not to make hasty decisions. Weak-handers usually lose, this is something to take into consideration after identifying three critical points of Mr. Nobuaki’s report: 1) Nobuaki Kobayashi’s power of decision and resource management “Unless the court makes a new decision, the bankruptcy proceedings will proceed as before, and I, as the bankruptcy trustee, continue to have the right to administer and dispose of the bankruptcy estate as before.” 2) The number of resources he manages. If with 35000 BTC an adverse reaction was generated, it is essential to be aware that he has the resources to do it again, producing more significant results. “The amount of BTC managed by the bankruptcy estate as of March 5, 2018, is 166,344.35827254 BTC… The amount of BCC managed by the bankruptcy estate as of March 5, 2018, is 168,177.35927254 BCC.”  3) The expressed willingness to do so again when deemed appropriate “I plan to consult with the court and determine further sale of BTC and BCC.” >>Ripple CEO: Cryptocurrencies Must Work With Government Regulations So far there has not been an official statement from Mr. Nobuaki Kobayashi or the courts of law, but social networks have been on fire since the information came out. Mainly because there is a conflict of interest between the users of the platform and Kobayashi as Mt.Gox representative since the number of bitcoins and altcoins that the users deposited in the exchange house have revalued a lot after Mt.Gox initiated the bankruptcy legal proceeding. Therefore, they expect to be reimbursed for their investment in cryptocurrency and not in FIAT money as Mr. Nobuaki’s strategy seems to pretend.  Featured Image: Twitter",9-Mar,2018
" Bitcoin investors should be careful; Bitcoin price (BTC) continues to make the sideways movement as the global investment communities are still unsure about the future of cryptocurrencies. The debate for its utilization as an alternative currency and medium of exchange has been going on for years. Bitcoin price was hammered from the $20,000 mark at the beginning of the year to only $6,000. This was after intellectuals, regulators and global leaders stressed on the need for regulating cryptocurrencies during the World Economic Forum.  Regulators and senior market analysts have turned significantly bearish on digital currencies. They don’t appreciate investments in bitcoin and other digital currencies – indeed they are predicting an instant crash and massive risk of losing the investment. Bitcoin’s trading volume has decreased substantially in the last few weeks following bearish comments from key players. The reports show that bitcoin transactions dropped to the lowest level in two years, while Google trends-data indicated a drop of 80% in searches for bitcoin. The U.K Prime Minister Theresa May had promised to carefully look at bitcoin and other digital currencies to avoid the illegal movement of wealth. The regulators from U.K. aren’t sending positive signals, suggesting strict regulatory actions from the one of the significant cryptocurrency market. While Bangladesh, India, China and several other countries have already banned cryptocurrency trading, amid the threat of money laundering and tax evasion – poor response from European and British regulators poses a risk for the possible crash in prices. Bitcoin investors should now take steps to protect their investment from risks that could result in complete losses, the Bank of England’s Chief Economist has warned. >>Apple Co-Founder Falls Victim To Bitcoin Scam Followed by harsh remarks from the Bank of England’s governor, the Chief Economist Andy Haldane warned for the immediate price crash.

" This week didn’t start off on the high for Bitcoin price (BTC) and its future fundamentals; BTC price is steadily moving downhill after hitting $11,500 during the weekend and in early trading on Monday. The downward trend was due to lower volume – which is a frustrating sign for bulls. Bitcoin prices lost close to $1,000 from its Monday high, the price of bitcoin token was around $10,594 today. It seems that bulls are losing their grip on the crypto markets after the ruthless response from major regulators of European countries and the United Kingdom. The entire crypto market has been under pressure over the last three days – Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and the rest of top ten digital currencies are declining at a mid-single-digit rate. Ethereum moves back below the $800 mark for the first time in the last fifteen days, while Ripple trades at around $0.90. Trading volume always has substantial importance in settling the price whether its stock market or crypto market. Lower trading volume signifies declining trader’s confidence – which could have the negative impact on the price performance.   Bitcoin has been experiencing a significant drop in trading volume and confirmed transactions over the last couple of weeks. The total confirmed transactions declined to the two year low of 180,000 on Feb 26.     Bitcoin Google search trends are falling at a tremendous rate suggesting a declining interest for cryptocurrencies. Google trend data indicated a drop of 80% in searches for bitcoin to the lowest level in last five months. While the global markets and financial world has widely accepted blockchain technologies, they aren’t accepting the cryptocurrency phenomena as an alternative currency – and they have several factual reasons for their denouncement. Regulators and business magnates are continually hammering trader’s sentiments by sending warning signals; the majority of them criticizing digital currencies due to its volatile nature, underlying value and its use for illegal purposes. The former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Rogoff believes bitcoin isn’t worth more than $100 in his view, saying: “I think Bitcoin will be worth a tiny fraction of what it is now if we’re headed out 10 years from now… I would see $100 as being a lot more likely than $100,000.” Featured Image: Depositphotos/© gustavofrazao",7-Mar,2018
" The Economic Times of India’s Global Business Summit took place this week, and it was inevitable that the cryptocurrency sector was going to be one of the topics discussed at length. What wasn’t foreseen, however, was Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak coming forward and saying he was a victim of a bitcoin scam.  It’s been known for quite some that bitcoin, as well as every other virtual currency, holds a lot of risks. But when the co-founder of one of the largest technology companies in the world falls into its trap, then we know that anyone is susceptible to being duped by cryptocurrency scams.  According to Wozniak, he had seven bitcoins stolen from him through fraud. Essentially what happened is this: an individual purchased the bitcoins from the 67-year old American entrepreneur and inventor through a credit card, and then proceeded to terminate the credit card payment. The scariest part of it all, according to Steve Wozniak, was just how easy it was to steal the bitcoins.  Sure, at first glance, seven bitcoins might not seem like a lot. However, it’s actually the opposite. At the time, Wozniak purchased the bitcoins back when it was valued at $700, but today, his loss is valued at roughly $71,400. Personally, this would have scared me off right away, but that wasn’t the case for the Apple co-founder.  >>India’s NASSCOM Partners With Blockchain Institute Wozniak kept his bitcoin holdings until the end of 2017. When he did finally announce in January that he sold his bitcoin holdings, he didn’t cite the bitcoin scam. In fact, he said it was only because he had only moved into cryptocurrency solely for experimental purposes. He then added that he never wanted to become one of those individuals that constantly watch it and fret over the price. That is extremely justifiable. It seems every week I’m biting my nails to see the direction the cryptocurrency is heading in. One week it’s dropping below the $12,000 mark and the next its well above it.  Now that we know about Steve Wozniak’s experience with the digital currency, I think it will be interesting to see if people follow in his lead and sell their bitcoin holdings in fear of falling victim to a bitcoin scam.

" I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again, it seems that people either love cryptocurrency and blockchain or they hate it. There’s no in-between. There’s no Switzerland. It’s an all or nothing sort of deal.  Earlier today, the U.K. Treasury Committee launched an inquiry into cryptocurrency and blockchain, stating that it will be looking into the risks and dangers open to consumers who use cryptocurrencies. Also announced today is that one of India’s most prominent tech industry organizations has partnered with the BRI, Blockchain Resource Institute. Why? To create a blockchain institute which will develop skill sets for blockchain adoption and usage in India. Pretty different compared to the U.K’s announcement, right? One country dislikes cryptocurrency and blockchain, the other loves it. Enough, at least, to partner with the BRI in order to help create a digital economy in India.  We also know that Canada is team cryptocurrency and blockchain. I mean, KFC now accepts Bitcoin as payment. That wasn’t enough, however, as India’s National Association of Software Services Companies (NASSCOM) disclosed today that BRI researchers will be backed by the government of Canada. The Canadian government, whose Prime Minister is Justin Trudeau, will be helping BRI developers to learn more about blockchain technology. The hope is that it will teach the researchers how to create various blockchain-based tools in India.  Blockchain has become extremely popular as of late. There are dozens of companies starting to integrate the technology into their corporate world. The chairman of NASSCOM stated that he believes blockchain will be beneficial to the nation but knows that it will be a long-term effort. In fact, the research is being split into two separate parts. The second phase will be the construction of a blockchain institute in India.  It will be interesting to see if all goes planned. If it does, I think it would be quite revolutionary.  Even CNN stated that a blockchain institute in India would “provide high-end technology capabilities.” What do you think?

" Is Bitcoin (BTC) the reason behind the crypto selloff? The crypto market has experienced some major losses in the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, all coins but two within the top 100, are down right now. To get a taste of the bloodshed, take a look at the data from CoinMarketCap: The top ten cryptocurrencies are all experiencing major losses. Leading the pack in losses is Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC). There’s no denying that the markets are struggling – but why? Bitcoin may be the reason. >> Check out the Crypto Olympics: Bitcoin vs. VeChain Bitcoin transaction fees are at their lowest level since October 2017. According to BitInfoCharts, which was last updated on February 20th, Bitcoin transactions fees are going for US$3.042. Bitcoin transactions fees have been declining ever since hitting their all-time high back in December 2017 (US$55.16). However, even as recently as a couple of weeks ago, Bitcoin transactions fees were in the $10 range. That’s not terribly expensive, but $3.00 is even better. I would imagine that there are a lot of people taking advantage of the relatively cheap Bitcoin transaction fees. This may explain why many of the altcoins are declining today – people are selling their altcoin assets so they can gobble up Bitcoin while it’s cheap to process. In addition to the cheap Bitcoin transaction fees, Coinbase and Bitfinex will be updating the exchanges with a software called SegWit. SegWit (Segregated Witness), is touted as a way to speed up Bitcoin transactions while also lowering fees by a further 20%. It does so by increasing the block size (so more transactions will be able to fit per block). This will drastically improve Bitcoin’s efficiency as a cryptocurrency if SegWit does what it is meant to do. Bitfinex accounts for almost 38% of all US dollar-Bitcoin trades. Coinbase accounts for about 17%. Coinbase’s rollout of SegWit won’t fully come into effect until the middle of next week; however, Bitfinex’s support of SegWit was announced yesterday. The adoption of SegWit by these two major exchanges will no doubt have strong long-term effects for Bitcoin. For right now, this could also be accounting for the altcoin selloff currently happening. People are getting ready to take advantage of the lower Bitcoin transaction fees and processing times by selling their other cryptos now. Neither of these points changes the fact that Bitcoin is also currently down. As for why Bitcoin is down right now, I’m not sure. But if Bitcoin is down, it’s little surprise that many of the other coins are also down. When Bitcoin drops, people tend to panic, selling not only their Bitcoin but also their other crypto assets. >> Bitcoin Price Watch Featured image: artispixel",21-Feb,2018
" The Bull Run Ends: Finally bulls lost their momentum after a two-week rally – which doubled the Bitcoin (BTC) price from the lows seen on Feb 6. Bitcoin, Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH) and the remaining top 20 currencies all posted significant losses today, and only Monero seems untouched by the crash. Bitcoin price was close to hitting the $12,000 mark yesterday; but BTC price took a big U-turn today, dipping more than 8% to the level of $10,700.  The crackdown on bitcoin traders in Bangladesh and pessimistic comments from the Bank of England weighed on cryptocurrency prices. The renewed regulatory concerns along with trader’s strategy to capitalize on the recent rally impacted virtual currency prices. The Dhaka Tribune reported a more forceful crackdown on cryptocurrency traders, and the report suggested that local police are “on the hunt for bitcoin users.” The Bangladeshi government warned their citizens to avoid using bitcoin for any financial transactions. Bangladesh Bank said, “Bitcoin is neither accepted nor considered legal tender anywhere in the world.” Bangladesh is among the third world countries and has been seeing high levels of corruption and money laundering. The country had previously barred their citizens from transferring money to abroad via illegal sources such as Hundi.  The emergence of digital currencies and their anonymity feature opened the doors for money launders to make the big movement of money. Bank of England (BoE) Chief Mark Carney added to bearish sentiments. He said, “Bitcoin has pretty much failed as a currency by standard benchmarks and is neither a store of value nor a useful way to buy items.” Mark Carney comments look strong because of the significant price volatility. For instance, if you want to purchase goods through bitcoin, then how would you settle the price for those goods given the significant bitcoin price swings?  Ethereum and Ripple, the second and the third largest digital currency, plunged more than 9% in Wednesday trading. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) were among the most prominent laggards; both fell more than 13% today. The selloff has wiped off $50 billion from total market capitalization of cryptocurrency markets. Analysts have a mixed opinion on the future of cryptocurrencies. Some analysts are predicting a sharp growth, while others are forecasting a lousy ending. Governments and central banks are supporting the innovative blockchain technologies; they have several concerns over the illegal use of virtual currencies, and their lack of underlying value.

" Bitcoin Soars 80%: Bitcoin (BTC) price has been on a rollercoaster over the last couple of months.The lack of underlying value and unpredictable nature of digital currencies continues to stun investors with massive sideways movements.    Since showing the considerable upside volatility at the end of last year, bitcoin’s downside volatility led the price to bottom near $6,000. After the massive selloff in late January and early February, bitcoin price rose 80% in the last two weeks alone. Bitcoin price has breached the $11000 mark during the weekend; the coin is trading at just over $11,000 this morning  – and now has the market capitalization of $185 billion. The broader rally in cryptocurrency prices has pushed the total market capitalization above $500 billion for the first time in the last three weeks.  Regulatory concerns along with the price manipulation and bearish remarks from notables were the key drivers for the violent selloff in bitcoin prices. However, softer than expected regulatory actions from South Korea and the United Stated led bulls to control the market over the last two weeks. South Korean authorities have been steadily moving back from their earlier strict stance. They have implemented less severe regulatory actions than what investors had initially thought. The U.S. CFTC chairman said, “regulators should have a thoughtful and balanced response and not a dismissive one.” Moreover, predictions of sustainable growth in bitcoin prices from key analysts have been adding to bullish sentiments. Saxo Bank analyst, Kay Van-Petersen, who appropriately predicted the substantial rally in cryptocurrency price at the start of last year – now forecasts that bitcoin is set to hit the $100,000 mark. Cryptocurrencies are in early stages, and it’s quite difficult to predict whether they will turn out to be a huge bubble, or if they can replace the traditional financial world. The Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin warned investors for the possible slump. He suggested investors invest the money only if they can afford to lose. He said: cryptocurrencies are still a new and hyper-volatile asset class, and could drop to near-zero at any time. Don’t put in more money than you can afford to lose. If you’re trying to figure out where to store your life savings, traditional assets are still your safest bet. Featured Image: twitter",19-Feb,2018

MonteCrypto: The Bitcoin Enigma is set to launch on Steam on February 20th. Steem is a cryptocurrency used to power the Steemit platform; a blockchain-based social media platform aimed at incentivizing users to create and curate content on Steemit. Each creator gets rewarded for their work. Currently, there is a 40% discount if you buy the game on its release date, costing only $1.19. The game itself is a first-person viewed game, similar to that of Call of Duty. It features 24 puzzles that you have to solve while making your way through a haunted mansion. What’s cool is it allows you to play as a team or you can play just individually. Each member will be able to leave clues or lead someone off track throughout the maze for others to find.  Source: MonteCrypto This sounds like an extremely cool game and well thought out. From what I can see, it doesn’t break any of Steam’s rules on games. The game developers have given out an initial clue on the game’s FAQ page.

" At this point, it’s fair to say the cryptocurrency industry is constantly evolving. Over the course of the past couple of months, we have seen a number of countries roll out new uses for virtual currencies. In Canada, for instance, individuals can now use Bitcoin to purchase meals from KFC. In Australia, travelers will soon be able to purchase items using Bitcoin in the Brisbane Airport. Now, we’ve been informed that luxury flats in Dubai can be purchased with the virtual currency. In fact, there have already been 50 flats sold in Dubai for Bitcoin. Business Insider published a report yesterday which stated that two UK entrepreneurs have sold 50 luxury flats in Dubai for Bitcoin. This is significant news as it suggests the cryptocurrency industry, at least in Dubai, might be making a move into real estate. The world was informed in September of last year that the two entrepreneurs, Michelle Mone and Douglas Barrowman, had launched a $325 million luxury development in Dubai. It is forecasted to be finished in two years. After announcing the launch of the ‘Aston Plaza and Residences’, Mone and Barrowman promised that they will be offering 150 apartments that can be purchased using bitcoin. For perspective, the entrepreneurs will be offering 150 apartments out of the 1,3000 for bitcoin. Offering luxury apartments in Dubai for bitcoin is definitely a first, but it appears investors are on board with it. According to the February Business Insider report, 50 out of the 150 apartments offered have been sold. In fact, Mone told the publication that there were a couple buyers who purchased two apartments. To top it off, Mone, who is the founder of lingerie brand Ultimo, stated that there was one buyer who bought as many as ten luxury Dubai apartments. This news comes at a time when more and more people are fighting to see more cryptocurrency regulation. In fact, the United States, Germany, and France have all called for crypto regulation to be discussed at next month’s G20 summit in Argentina. Therefore, it will be interesting to see how the outcome of the summit affects the potential sale of more Dubai apartments for bitcoin. Read More About Cryptocurrency Regulation >> What do you think?

" Bitcoin predictions: Cryptocurrencies have been stabilizing over the past three days – something rather unprecedented. Markets had witnessed Bitcoin’s upside volatility last year but found it equally volatile on the downside; the slump from $19,000 to less than $6,000 in last month alone vindicated the instability for both trends.   In spite of the massive sideways movement, returns from crypto funds topped hedge fund returns last year. For instance, Pantera Capital, which started its first cryptocurrency fund in 2013, generated returns of 22,000 percent since its inception. Last year, Cryptocurrency fund returns were significantly higher from the average gains of 7% from hedge funds. Dan Morehead, the CEO of Pantera Capital, who bought his first bitcoin for around $72, is now predicting a substantial rally in price. He said, “Bitcoin should return to peak levels in the next couple of weeks and will continue growing from there.” In December, Dan predicted bitcoin price to fall by half before rising back up. The first part of his prediction turned out to be true and now traders are carefully thinking about the second part of his prophecy.  Bitcoin and other digital currencies are showing strong support trading around their current level. The entire cryptocurrency market has been flat over the last three days; seems it is looking for solid reports to make a new trend. Some analysts are now correlating the movement of crypto markets with stock markets, expecting prices to trade in similar trends.  This assumption could be partially correct as the overall market sentiments offer support to the whole investment markets. Last year, the rally in tech, financial and industrial stocks combined with Trump’s business pro initiatives, led the major U.S. indices to hit new records. Though Bitcoin and digital currencies have beaten stock market returns last year, the market dynamics seems quite tough this year. Experts are predicting the crash, while regulators are making strict rules to reduce illegal activities associated with the currencies. Global financial institutions are calling them a risk to global financial stability. However, traders aren’t ignoring the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies; allowing bulls to strengthen their stance of getting support from regulatory actions. They believe regulating cryptocurrencies could turn out to be a positive catalyst for long-term sustainability. Featured Image: twitter",9-Feb,2018
" Bitcoin prediction: It’s been the roughest week yet for cryptocurrencies as the price of Bitcoin sank to just over $6000 – its lowest since November. This, coupled with regulatory fears and ICO scams, has led to increasingly bearish sentiments towards the cryptocurrency market in general. It has lost $340 billion USD since the start of the year. So it’s great news for investors today, as the price of Bitcoin unexpectedly soared 11.4% – over $800 USD – from last night’s low, at 3:30 pm EST this afternoon (the time of writing). But the even bigger news is that analysts are predicting Bitcoin to hit $50K this year. In an interview with CNBC, Thomas Glucksmann, head of APAC business development at Gatecoin, said that “There is no reason why we couldn’t see bitcoin pushing $50,000 by December.” This, he says, is due to a market rebound as well as “major technology developments” such as bitcoin’s upcoming Lightning Network, which aims to speed up transactions. >> Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC): Coins to Invest in Before the Market Recovers In the same report, Jamie Burke, CEO of Outlier Ventures, stated that he believes the market will likely go on a bull run. It will be “comparative if not greater than last year potentially reaching the trillion-dollar mark before a proper crypto winter sets in,” he said. This ‘crypto winter‘ refers to a period where the market will settle down and focus on market fundamentals, potentially becoming more stable. And to top it all off, Ran Neuner, host of CNBC’s Cryptotrader show, pinned this tweet to his account in a moment of bravery: For the record, I am pinning this tweet. Bitcoin will finish 2018 at $50 000. — Ran Neuner (@cryptomanran) February 2, 2018 With such optimism abound in the industry, it may really be true that we’ll see Bitcoin grow tens of thousands of dollars in coming months. But it’s important to bear in mind that such predictions have been made before… >> Cryptocurrencies – Excitement is Limited In 2014, a Coindesk poll showed that most readers thought that one Bitcoin would reach $10,000 by the end of that year, while venture capital firm LightSpeed India gave it a more modest $4000 – $5000. It ended the year at about $315. This goes both ways, of course. In 2015, a Financial Times article gave a bleak outlook for the cryptocurrency, playing on the fact that it had been floating at around $350 for months and that the chances of it becoming a mainstream currency ‘are now zero’. The mainstream currency statement is still debatable, but the article certainly hasn’t aged well since bitcoin hit nearly $20,000 per coin about three years later. Anyway, none of this is to say that bitcoin won’t do well this year, but it is a casual reminder to be wary of predictions which seem authoritative. Either way, it looks as though it’s safe to be bullish at the moment and hope that today’s great performance continues in coming weeks. Featured image: BTCmanager.com",7-Feb,2018
" The cryptocurrency market is continuing to rebound after a shaky day yesterday. Coincidentally, the Dow Jones plunged a total of 1,100 points yesterday, around 4.6%, which is the lowest since the European debt crisis back in 2011. The stock market corrected itself from yesterday’s downfall, is there a correlation between the two? I really don’t think so. The cryptocurrency market crash plummeted yesterday, due to the Chinese government implementing a regulation completely banning its citizens from viewing cryptocurrency websites, via a government-ran firewall. Many analysts are stating that yesterday’s drop was due to rising inflation and the usual market correction. This shows that there is absolutely no correlation between the drop of the two markets. Back in 2008, the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), and its blockchain were born. It was due to the housing financial crisis, where the banks (due to greed) crashed the entire stock market. Satoshi Nakamoto, the Alias, and originator of Bitcoin envisioned a decentralized digital currency that isn’t controlled by a singular entity – this was Bitcoin’s original promise. >> Bitcoin Price Analysis Bitcoin as an Investment Asset? However, the issue most individuals are having with Bitcoin is that it is failing to live up to its original promise. Bitcoin and its blockchain were intended, by its unknown creator, to be a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Its current scalability issues have resulted in slow transaction times and high fees. BTC remains the top cryptocurrency with the highest total market cap and highest price, however, it could be passed in market cap this year. Just a year ago the digital currency held 85% of the total cryptocurrency market cap dominance but now, is currently only 35%. The digital token just this year has transitioned from a digital currency used for peer to peer transactions, to an investable asset, like gold and silver. Many new altcoins on the market are being used as a payment and transaction system instead because their transaction confirmation time is 10 times faster than that of Bitcoins. >> Stellar & Ripple Comparison Bitcoin doesn’t even come close to Litecoin (LTC), DASH (DASH), Ripple (XRP), and Stellar (XLM) when it comes to transaction time confirmation. Some Bitcoin holders now use the cryptocurrency to purchase large ticket items, such as houses and cars but day-to-day payments with BTC do not occur. If Bitcoin developers can agree upon and fix its scalability issue, it could potentially switch back to its original goal. However, with faster blockchain projects/coins popping up every day, I believe that it is highly unlikely. Featured Image: Gizmodo",6-Feb,2018
" Global energy giant Enel has sharply announced that it has “no interest whatsoever” in supplying energy to cryptocurrency mining operations, say Reuters. The decision comes after a brief period of research in which the Italian company was in talks to supply Swiss mining firm Envion AG with power from renewable sources. According to a Bloomberg report, the discussions with Envion were part of a broader effort by Enel to look at the market for selling power to cryptocurrency miners. >> Mining for Charity: UNICEF’s Ethereum Donation Drive Enel is one of Europe’s top renewable energy suppliers and is also the primary energy supplier in Italy. It explained its decision in a report by Reuters, stating that they have made clear steps toward sustainable energy and therefore “sees the intensive use of energy dedicated to cryptocurrency mining as an unsustainable practice that does not fit with the business model it is pursuing.” The move is sure to disappoint Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiasts in the country, who likely are waiting for some good news amid harsh government crackdowns on cryptocurrencies elsewhere. On the bright side, despite Enel’s aversion to digital coins, they are still keen to explore the applications of blockchain technology in the energy industry. This was the primary focus of the EnelFocusOn event that was hosted in Santiago, Chile, on February 2nd. The event saw Joel Comm, a ‘blockchain evangelist’, highlight solutions offered by blockchain in “making the energy industry more sustainable”, say Enel. >> More Crypto Bans: Lloyds Shuts Down Credit Card Purchases Bitcoin mining is becoming a hot topic as governments, energy companies and environmentalists grow increasingly concerned with the huge amounts of electricity needed to operate mining farms. Many Chinese mining companies are looking to the west for potential mining spots as the Chinese government, overburdened by energy demand, begins a crackdown on the activity. Renewable energy is of particular interest given its abundance, sustainability and relative cheapness in places such as Canada, yet the demand is pushing suppliers to breaking point. Meanwhile, the Italian government has proposed cryptocurrency regulations which will ‘clarify’ the use of Bitcoin and others in the country. According to Coindesk, the regulations will help enforce new anti-money laundering rules put forward by the European Union. As a result, businesses who make transactions with cryptocurrency would be recorded. Featured image: Enel.com",5-Feb,2018
" Want some free Bitcoin? You’ll have to solve a puzzle first. Artist Marguerite deCourcelle, also known as coin artist, has been hiding Bitcoin in digital paintings for years. Her third Bitcoin puzzle, released in April 2015, has finally been solved. Whoever solved the puzzle remains a mystery but they are now the proud new owner of around $50,000 worth of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin puzzle series, “The Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto”, has been going on for a long time. It took nearly three years for the third puzzle in the series, “TORCHED H34R7S”, to be solved. When deCourcelle and her team originally placed the key to the Bitcoin wallet into the digital painting, the wallet contained 4.87 Bitcoins – which was, at the time, worth about $1,400.

Interestingly, in November 2017, the wallet saw its first signs of activity since the puzzle had been released – not in the form of someone claiming the Bitcoin, but someone actually depositing more in! This mystery was revealed to be part of a Bitcoin hack that’s been quietly haunting the crypto world. It worked out for whoever solved the puzzle, though, because it meant there was more Bitcoin to claim. While the identity of the puzzle solver will remain anonymous, the solution for “TORCHED H34R7S” has now been released and it is quite the solution!

" Bitcoin price plummeted below the support level of $8000 for a third time today. The huge volatility in crypto markets wiped off more than $417 billion from the total market capitalization in the last month alone making this bitcoin price plunge one of the greatest yet. Consequently, the broader selloff has pulled back the cryptocurrency prices at the lowest level in the last three months. Bitcoin price plunged below $8,000 during the Friday trade, and although bounced back above $9,000 over the weekend, it has again dipped below $8,000 today. After those dramatic swings, it is currently trading in the range of $7,400.   China, which has recently expressed strong concerns over the cryptocurrency trading, is now planning to impose a complete ban on domestic and international cryptocurrency trading platforms. Based on the local media reports, the Central Bank of China is likely to block all platforms related to the issuance of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency trading. Already, China has banned cryptocurrency trading in domestic markets. But now, the country has extended the concentrated efforts to foreign platforms too. >>What Is France’s Stance On Bitcoin Regulations? The Financial News reported:  “In the future, any related (platform) will be closed as soon as it is found. At the same time, further regulatory measures will be taken with the future development of the situation,”   Last week, comments from the Indian finance minister created the huge crash in prices. During the budget speech, he stated that “the country wants to eliminate the use of digital currencies in criminal activities”  and this plunged the bitcoin price below $8,000 for the first time on Friday since November 24. Cryptocurrency mania seems to be ending over the last month. After South Korea, several major institutions have stressed for the strict regulatory actions against the cryptocurrencies. The largest U.S. banks such as Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase, have stopped their customers from buying cryptocurrencies using credit cards. Following that trend, the U.K. lender, Lloyds Banking Group, has also implemented the same policy. The signal is clear; there is less trust in cryptocurrency markets.

" Another shipping company has now joined the global blockchain revolution, this time it’s UPS. According to a filing with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the global shipping giant is considering setting up a system of locker banks so that it could take in Bitcoin as payment.   >>Bitcoin Price Analysis – Can BTC/USD Rebound? Here’s how it works: As outlined in the USPTO filing document, a seller can leave an item inside a locker (which can be rented) for the buyer to pick up later-on by entering the designated payment, thus completing the transaction. The aim is to create a point-of-sale (POS) system that accepts the following payment methods: However, only time will tell whether this kind of locker bank system will appeal to the general public and whether people are willing to use Bitcoins to pay for UPS packages. This is not the first time that UPS expressed its intention to dabble in the blockchain industry. In November, the company joined a blockchain consortium called the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance, focused on the trucking and shipping industry. On joining the consortium, Linda Weakland, UPS director of enterprise architecture and innovation, stated: “The technology has the potential to increase transparency and efficiency among shippers, carriers, brokers, consumers, vendors and other supply chain stakeholders.” >>The Best Cryptocurrency Memes in 2018 (So Far) With today’s announcement, we are starting to see a trend where shipping companies — which make up a vital part of the global economy — are leaning towards using Bitcoin as a mainstream method of payment.

" The correlation between Google search and price movement Analysts are now supporting their predictions using the Google search volume. Their assumptions are purely based on the number of people putting the bitcoin keyword into Google Search. According to estimates, Google search for bitcoin soared sharply in December. The worldwide searches for bitcoin tripled in December compared with the previous month. The strategy looks to be effective, considering the correlation between price movement, trading volume, and google searches. Colas, the first analyst to follow bitcoin said, “Google search patterns can forecast bitcoin’s future. He said he uses Google Trends to track how many people enter “bitcoin” into the search engine.” The growth in bitcoin popularity also supported the growth in numbers of wallets. However, Google search volume for bitcoin declined sharply by 75% in January and as it declined so did market value.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com   The popularity of Bitcoin (BTC) continues declining since the start of this month after hitting its peak in December ($19,000). It has fallen back to below $10,000. As expected, the movement in Google search volume reflected the bitcoin price movement. So, why are popularity and price going down? Several factors contributed to the decline in bitcoin’s popularity; negative comments from numerous leaders and Central Banks during World Economic Forum weighed on traders sentiments and potential buyers. A Crack-down on digital currency from South Korea, India and China has also impacted the trading volume. South Korea and China have banned cryptocurrency trading through anonymous accounts, amid the threat of criminal activities and during the budget presentation speech, the Indian finance minister clearly denounced cryptocurrencies; “The government does not consider cryptocurrencies as legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate the use of these crypto assets in financing illegitimate activities.” Market pundits are also blaming other blockchain technologies for the decline in bitcoin’s popularity. For instance, several payment services companies are showing their confidence in Ripple (XRP) and other blockchain technologies, due to faster transactions times than bitcoin. Stripe, the online payments company, announced it would not support Bitcoin anymore, citing a number of reasons for this move. Stripe said, “Bitcoin transaction confirmation times have risen substantially; this, in turn, has led to an increase in the failure rate of transactions. … By the time the transaction is confirmed, fluctuations in Bitcoin price mean that it’s for the “wrong” amount. … Furthermore, fees have risen a great deal … making Bitcoin transactions about as expensive as bank wires.”    Featured Image: twitter",1-Feb,2018
" India’s anti-Bitcoin sentiments have caused a crypto-wide panic to spread around the world. The country’s finance minister Arun Jaitley announced during the budget speech today that cryptocurrency was not considered legal tender in India. When the news broke, people immediately began blowing his words out of proportion. Jaitley stated that the Indian government “will take all measures to eliminate the use of these cryptoassets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payments system.” >> What crypto coins are best for making small payments? This doesn’t mean the Indian government is planning to outright ban Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They will continue to caution against it and are planning to severely crack down on the illegal activities that result from crypto. But a full-scale ban? Not quite yet. Many people appear to have interpreted it this way, however, and cryptos have taken a rough beating today as a result. Bitcoin is down nearly 10% in the last 24 hours, dropping below $10,000, and out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, only two coins are actually up (DigixDAO and Aeternity) at the time of writing. >> Aeternity makes the list of our 5 cryptocurrencies under $5 10% may not seem like a whole lot, but because Bitcoin holds such a large amount of the overall crypto market cap, the crypto market cap has plummetted as a result. In the course of 24 hours, the total crypto market cap has tanked by around $50 billion. What we have witnessed today is a pretty good display of what would probably happen was India to actually ban crypto. India accounts for nearly 10% of all Bitcoin transactions (coincidence that that is also the percentage that Bitcoin fell today?). If crypto loses India, that could severely damage the market. What is interesting is that India is against crypto, but not against blockchain. Jaitley also stated that “The Government will explore use of block chain technology proactively for ushering in digital economy.” So it’s not all doom and gloom. Blockchain will survive, even if crypto doesn’t. What do you think? Will India change its mind and ban crypto altogether? Or is the panic all for nothing? >> KODAKCoin ICO launch delayed Featured image: hackernoon",1-Feb,2018
" Square Cash App finally integrates bitcoin support. Following a trial period involving a handful of users, the payment company launched bitcoin integration yesterday and saw a rise in stocks as a result. To accompany the launch, Square has also released a completely adorable Bitcoin tutorial in the style of a children’s book, titled ‘My First Bitcoin and the Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto‘. Through its colorful, pop-up artsy pages, the slideshow takes readers through the fundamental basics of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in terms an (albeit financially-minded) five-year-old could understand. Square CEO Jack Dorsey said in a tweet: “Instant buying (and selling, if you don’t want to hodl) of bitcoin is now available to most Cash App customers. We support Bitcoin because we see it as a long-term path towards greater financial access for all.” >> Turkish Soccer Team Purchases New Player With Bitcoin This is very good news for the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, which was recently dropped by online payment processor Stripe amid growing troubles with its use. Although today’s news still leaves bitcoin (BTC) in the red on coinmarketcap’s charts, Square’s stocks have risen around 3% in response. Square’s Cash app allows users to transfer funds on a person-to-person (P2P) or person-to-business basis, meaning you can pay a bill or send a friend $10. Today’s update will allow users to buy and deposit up to $10,000 USD worth of bitcoin per week, and with no additional purchase charge. In terms of pricing, Square will look across a range of exchanges to try and find an average. The only downside to all this is that technically, you don’t actually hold the bitcoin you use with Square; they do. >> Bitcoin Value Halves in January. What’s Next For the Cryptocurrency? Where bitcoins are traditionally held in a digital wallet tied to a device such as a computer, phone or even a memory stick, the coins a user owns on Square Cash are tied to their Square account, meaning they are out of the user’s hands to an extent. Some Bitcoin enthusiasts may argue that this counters the total financial freedom that Bitcoin is meant to endow. This does also present some upsides, however, as it means users can lose a device or their password and still recover their coins. In any case, crypto trading services are becoming increasingly popular as more begin to compete with Coinbase, the current standard. When trading service Robinhood announced it was to add zero-fee trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH), more than one million people signed up to the early-access waiting list. ‘Zero-fee’ is the buzzword here, as Coinbase typically charges 1.5 to 4 percent fees in the US. If Square can match this level of interest, it’s going to be a good year for the service, and possibly for cryptocurrency too. It certainly needs the rejuvenation.

" This week, a Turkish soccer team, Harunustaspor use bitcoin to sign their newest player. The tiny Turkish soccer team has become the first in the world to purchase a payer using Bitcoin (BTC) or any cryptocurrency, making history. Club president Haldun Şehit proposed the deal, which amounts to a total of $1,197 USD, to player Ömer Faruk Kıroğlu, who agreed to play until the end of the season. The total amount comprises of 0.0524 BTC ($522.24 USD at the time of writing), and a further equivalent of $664.80 USD in cash. >> Soccer and Cryptocurrencies are starting to merge The deal is very small in comparison to what happens in other national leagues such as the UK’s Premier League, where signings regularly go for the equivalent of tens of millions of dollars. Indeed, Harunustaspor does not even compete in Turkey’s top football league, currently playing in the first division of Sakarya Amateur League. Yet today’s deal is still globally significant within the sport, which has been increasingly involved in cryptocurrency in recent weeks. Only last week, Arsenal signed a partnership deal with Cashbet Coin. Meanwhile, the London Football Exchange announced plans to launch its own cryptocurrency. With this in mind, Harunustapor’s offer may be small financially but it’s a huge step in terms of how digital currencies operate within sports. Quoted in Turkish-Football, Mr. Şehit said of the deal: “This is a first in Turkey and the world, and we are proud of this achievment.” Meanwhile, transferee Kıroğlu said: “This is the future. As someone open to new technology it made sense.” So what will happen going forward? No-one can really say. It could be that Harunustapor will be iconically known as the first soccer team to engage in a Bitcoin-based transfer. It could also mark the sport’s embrace of a new or alternative financial system. Or, it could simply blow over while things will carry on as usual. It’s hard to say, yet despite Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, in general, suffering big losses the past few weeks, soccer and other sports have embraced digital currency in some surprising and unlikely ways. An ICO token sale promoted by champion boxer Floyd Mayweather raised $30 million USD last year, while fans of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team will be able to purchase game tickets with Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) next season. This is not the first time that Turkey has pioneered cryptocurrency usage. Last month, it became the first country to settle a freight deal in Bitcoin between itself and a Russian ship delivering wheat. Do you think this is the start of a new way forward for sports teams, or will it prove to be just a trend? Featured Image: Twitter",31-Jan,2018
" Bitcoin value halves in the first month of 2018.  Despite an incredible 2017, this January has been the worst month for Bitcoin. Bulls provided a lot of support to Bitcoin (BTC) price by presenting different theories and hypothesis that it is becoming a million dollar investment, ultimately though, bears controlled the price since the start of this year.  Bitcoin started this month trading around the $14,000 level with the price hitting a monthly high of $17,500 on Jan 5. Since then, however, bitcoin’s value has declined at a sharp pace. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading around $10,300, down 6% in past 24 hours.  Source Image: coinmarketcap.com There are two major reasons. The volatile nature of bitcoin’s price leading to panic sell-offs, and the possibility of cryptocurrency regulations. Overall, the huge volatility in bitcoin price has reduced its market capitalization to $171 billion. From its all-time high of $332 billion, this is a loss of almost half of its value. Although analysts are impressed by innovative blockchain technologies, the future of bitcoin depends highly on regulatory requirements. Several countries have begun deliberating about cryptocurrency regulations. >> The Uk and France are in talks to implement cryptocurrency regulations. Along with regulatory concerns and poor feedback from major analysts, the efficiency of bitcoin blockchain technology has significantly impacted the price. Stripe has announced an end to its support for the coin, while several other companies including MoneyGram, MercuryFX, and others have begun supporting Ripple’s xRapid product instead. Facebook has now also announced to ban ads promoting digital currencies, binary options, and initial coin offerings, warning: “They’re frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices.” The bitcoin crash amplified further since the start of this week, due to reports that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission sent subpoenas to Bitfinex and Tether, who claimed that the coin is backed by the dollar. Moreover, lower trading volume from South Korean markets after the implementations of new rules has added to traders concerns. The U.S. government has been showing their concerns for fake ICO’s; a number of companies are announcing initial coin offerings to raise the money without any business behind it. Useless Ethereum took the crypto market by storm last week, despite being totally useless. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced a strong crackdown on the illegal use of cryptocurrencies and fake ICO’s. The U.S. SEC has also announced to freeze all the assets of a Texas-based initial coin offering that claimed to have raised more than $600million. So, despite the many reasons behind bitcoin value halving in January, what do you think? Is there room for a comeback? Featured Image: Depositphotos/© rastudio",31-Jan,2018
" Judd Gregg and Bitcoin (BTC). Should we also compare bitcoin to gold? The former New Hampshire Governor thinks so. There have been a number of prominent leaders joining in on the conversation surrounding the cryptocurrency industry lately. Last week, we heard from Howard Schultz, the chairman of Starbucks. Schultz stated that while he is a fan of cryptocurrency, he does not like bitcoin. Who do you agree with? Yesterday, The Hill published an opinion piece that featured the three-term senator. Gregg is cited as saying that he strongly believes that bitcoin, a virtual currency, has the potential to change the way that the world views currency.  In the exchange with The Hill, Judd Gregg compared bitcoin to gold. This comparison has been done a number of times both this year and last year. However, this time, Gregg stated that gold has value because it is accepted by banks, while bitcoin is only supported by shareholders beliefs.  >> Read More About What People Are Saying About Bitcoin When it comes to commercial transactions, Gregg stated that bitcoin has the potential to alter how the world views these transactions. It’s not entirely surprising that Gregg has come forward with this view, considering there are a number of politicians now coming to terms with the possibilities of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.  It’s not just Gregg and Schultz who have come forward with their views on bitcoin. From Katy Perry to Joseph Stiglitz, it seems everyone has something to say about the cryptocurrency sector. Not only that, but there have been a number of companies who have made a move into the blockchain technology industry. This is a cause for concern for some, as there is a decent amount of people who fear that people are investing in both bitcoin and blockchain without having a 100% grasp of the industries.  >> More Prominent Leaders Who Have Opened Up About Cryptocurrency Regardless of what people think, however, the industry seems to have a mind of its own. One moment you think bitcoin is going to keep climbing, and the next you think of it as a bubble that is bound to burst any minute. No matter what people say, we never really know who to believe. At least, not yet.  Featured Image: wmur.com",30-Jan,2018
" Social Media Giant Facebook Bans Cryptocurrency Ads In what comes as a somewhat unsurprising move, social media giant Facebook has now banned all ads that promote cryptocurrencies — including bitcoin and ICOs — to protect its users from deceptive financial products and services.  Source: Facebook As a result of Facebook’s new policy, we won’t be able to see ads featuring people like “crypto genius” James Altucher, who has been featured in the media quite prominently because of his endorsement of the digital currency. Recently, Facebook has been a target of heavy criticism for hosting dubious ads that look to promote cryptocurrency. Some of these ads could potentially be associated with scams that are seemingly ubiquitous all over the internet right now. Many have pointed out that these ads use “fake information” to trick investors into putting money into “initial coin offerings”. >>BitConnect Officially Shuts Down — Ponzi Scheme Confirmed? Facebook is certainly not the only platform to host fraudulent promotions.  Recently, some investors were hoodwinked into buying a digital coin supposedly promoted by John McAfee — founder of cybersecurity firm McAfee — through his “official Twitter account”, only to find out later that the “tweet” they saw was actually sent from a bogus Twitter account with an almost identical Twitter handle as McAfee’s official one. This was just one of a myriad of cases where people got hoaxed into buying cryptocurrencies and became victims of such schemes in recent months. >>Nigerians Are Using An Old Approach To Beat Bitcoin Scams In its latest blog post, Facebook provided the following statement: “We want people to continue to discover and learn about new products and services through Facebook ads without fear of scams or deception. That said, there are many companies who are advertising binary options, ICOs and cryptocurrencies that are not currently operating in good faith.”  Today’s announcement marks another critical step in Facebook’s pathway to clean up its platform. Over the past few weeks, Facebook already made significant changes to its News Feed, aiming to filter out untrustworthy news sources while boosting local news outlets and posts from friends and family. Time will tell how effective Facebook’s new policy will be in protecting its users from more cryptocurrency scams, but this is definitely good news for the Facebook audience.

" Bitcoin (BTC) price grew in the second half of 2017. The digital currency peaked above $19,000 at the end of last year but, lost nearly half of its value in the new few weeks. Bitcoin continues to trade in a narrow range over the last two weeks is currently trading around the $11,000 mark. Traders blame the lack of regulation for the huge plunge in prices, however, they are ignoring the growth in bitcoin miners and the decline in the cost of production. >> Hackers are Mining Cryptocurrency using Video Websites Mining is a lucrative business that doesn’t require intellectual property or specific knowledge, so it is now advantageous for arbitrageurs to easily mine bitcoin.  And thanks to low regulatory requirements, several new players are entering the mining markets. For instance, CryptoWatt, LLC, recently announced the purchase of MSE Technologies’ grounds and buildings in order to transform them into a mining operation likely to begin this March. Moreover, technology companies are making mining easier by developing chips for specifically for it. The low entry barrier will allow more arbitrageurs to start mining and this will substantially increase supply, beginning the decline of bitcoin miner’s profitability. The result will be modest profits against the cost of mining. Chairman and CEO Thomas Peterffy said, “a sharp bitcoin price decline could cause liquidity issues for the clearinghouses that could spread across financial markets and lead to a Lehman-style collapse.” >> The Next Global Hotspots for Bitcoin Mining Energy consumption is the major cost. Mining a single coin is eventually determined by how much the electricity spend is on operating a mining rig. Based on an Elite Fixture survey, South America has the potential to mine a single coin for $531. Venezuela is among those countries that offer the cheapest cost to mine altcoins. On the other hand, South Korea, driven by higher electricity costs, is the most expensive country to mine bitcoin. Featured Image: twitter",30-Jan,2018
" A British man has been forced to hand over Bitcoin (BTC) at gunpoint in what is the first armed cryptocurrency theft in the country, say reports. Danny Aston, 30, called the police to his home in Moulsford, Oxfordshire, at 9:40 am GMT on Monday after four masked robbers forced entry. The robbers reportedly demanded that Mr. Aston, an ex-financier-turned-Bitcoin-trader, transfer an unknown amount of Bitcoin to them before leaving the scene. No-one was injured in the event. Though the exact amount transferred has not been specified, it could be very large due to the nature of Mr. Aston’s work which involves his company: Aston Digital Currencies Ltd. >> Beware of the Bitcoin ATMs One mother told British newspaper The Mail on Sunday that she saw “Four young men in black tracksuits” approach Mr. Ashton’s property that day. Shortly after the incident, a local school was temporarily placed on lockdown as a police helicopter scoured the area, according to the Daily Mail. Thames Valley Police are asking for witnesses to come forward to aid in the thieves’ arrest, which will surely prove to be a challenge since Bitcoin is designed to be untraceable. Though this news is unprecedented in the UK, and especially in a small Oxfordshire town, it is not the first time that an armed cryptocurrency heist has taken place. Canadian police are searching for two suspects involved in a cryptocurrency exchange robbery on Tuesday 23rd January. Three people, armed with handguns, stormed the offices of Canadian Bitcoins in Ottawa, Ontario, in an attempt to force employees to transfer funds. The suspects fled, and one of them caught, after police were called by an employee who remained hidden, said CBC news. It is not clear whether the suspects wanted Bitcoin specifically, regular funds transferred, or physical cash. >> 2017 Was the Year of the ICO but What Will Happen to ICOs in 2018? The prospect of increasing cryptocurrency crime, especially physical robberies, won’t do much to inhibit the swathes of regulatory action being implemented by governments around the world. China, South Korea, France, and Russia are all mulling over ways to control the growing phenomenon of digital currency, and this is having a negative impact on market prices. Plus, with most cryptocurrencies being pretty much untraceable, police forces are going to have to reconsider the way they approach the issue. If you are in the UK and have any information you can call Thames Valley Police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. If you have any information on the Ottawa robbery, call the robbery unit on 613-236-1222 or Crime Stoppers anonymously on 1-800-222-8477. Featured image: Caribbean National Weekly",30-Jan,2018
" The price of Bitcoin (BTC) increased sharply over the weekend and hit a high of $12,000 on Sunday. The jump from Friday’s low of $10,400 was short-lived however as the market was suddenly hit by the Coincheck hack resulting in the theft of $530 million worth of NEM coins (NEM). Bitcoin price has been volatile since the start of this year but the latest hack may have damaged faith in the cryptocurrency even further. Although the Coincheck management ensures a refund of almost $425 million, Japan’s Financial Services Agency has raised questions over whether Coincheck actually has enough funds for the compensation. The hack has not only exposed the security of the entire cryptocurrency markets, it has also raised concerns about regulatory requirements. >> Many countries, including France, are planning to issue cryptocurrency regulations Japan’s Financial Services Agency announced on Monday that they will check the security measures of each cryptocurrency exchange. The agency has also ordered Coincheck to improve security measures. Coincheck said, “The NEM coins were stored in a “hot wallet” instead of the more secure “cold wallet,” outside of the internet.”  The broader sell-off was observed throughout Monday trade, thanks to additional concerns related to Tether. Cryptocurrencies started struggling after Coindesk reported that Tether had parted ways with its auditors. As a result, trader concerns have now been raised over whether Tether has artificially raised their value, which they said had been backed by the dollars. Nicholas Weaver – a professor at UC Berkeley’s International Computer Science Institute, said that a “true bloodbath” is likely if Tether couldn’t prove their value in actual dollars. He said: “At current prices, net new Bitcoin requires $18million of net new dollars flowing in to maintain the price… Yet there is a net $100million a day of fake dollars in the form of Tethers.” Bitcoin is trading at around $11,378 at the time of writing, down 4% from the previous day. On Monday trade, Ethereum (ETC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and several other digital currencies will be struggling to trade in the green. Analysts expect the Bitcoin price to plunge 80% amid Tether concerns, regulatory concerns from South Africa and the Philippines, and from other major countries likely to cap the upside potential of digital currencies.   >> The UK may implement new cryptocurrency regulations also.

" 2017 was the breakout year for cryptocurrency. Starting at the beginning of the year, the total market cap for all cryptocurrencies was just over $17 billion and at the end of December, it reached just under $600 billion. Bitcoin (BTC), the original cryptocurrency, from the year 2013 to the beginning of 2017, held almost 90% dominance of the total market.  Currently, BTC only holds 34.4% dominance. As cryptocurrency gained mainstream attention, Bitcoin slowly started losing the market cap dominance as individuals started buying up the less expensive coins to get their hands in the market. 2018 is shaping up to be the year of the altcoins, as you can see from the chart below. Bitcoin’s growth has slowed since it’s Bitcoin futures contracts launched on two Wall Street exchanges, mid-December. I would like to add, however, that BTC is still up over 1100% for the year in growth. Many who got in early investing in Bitcoin, made a serious profit last year. More BTC News >>  Source: CoinMarketCap As investors seek the “next Bitcoin”, Ethereum has held slow dominance. It was passed by Ripple (XRP) briefly two times in a years time, in May of 17′ and a week and a half ago. However, currently, it remains the clear second on the market by almost $60 billion. Both development teams on Bitcoin and the Ethereum network are facing the same issue, scalability. Transaction times on the Bitcoin blockchain have slowed exponentially and yesterday transaction times were around 2,000 minutes. The current fees associated with withdrawing Bitcoin and converting it to your fiat currency on Coinbase is currently around 60% (BTC/CAD). This is to cover the cost of the slow transaction time and the high fee. Bitcoin.org has even changed their website’s language, as you can see from the comparison photo below. The lightning network is the project that is supposed to speed up the current Bitcoin blockchain, by adding a “layer” to the top of it for micropayments. Its current test net is running and it is being used but has endured several bug issues. ETH News >>  Source: CCN Ethereum’s main development team is working on scaling the Ethereum blockchain by way of quadratic “sharding.” In a Github post posted two days ago, the founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, points out the specs as to what sharding will look like. He held a developer meeting recently and anticipated that the fourth phase should be completed “in a month and a bit.” “Then from there we’re going to try and shard it into a working test, a kind of test network,” Vitalik said. If the Ethereum team can get this up and functioning faster than the lightning network, this could mean big things for the cryptocurrency.

" Imagine buying your favorite Starbucks beverage with cryptocurrency on your way to work each morning. This could well be happening in the future. During the company’s earnings call on Thursday, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) Chairman Howard Schultz provided his own personal view on the “fast brewing” cryptocurrency market, fully backing the potential and practicality of digital coins in the future. Starbucks in Argentina caught mining on customers’ laptops>> According to Schultz, there will be one or a few legitimate digital currencies based on the blockchain technology that consumers will be able to trust. “I’m talking about […] the possibility of what could happen — not in the near term, but in a few years from now — with a consumer application in which there’s trust and legitimacy with regard to a digital currency.” However, Schultz’s version of a digital currency world excludes Bitcoin, the No. 1 cryptocurrency right now. Like many business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos had mentioned this week, the Starbucks executive does not consider Bitcoin to be a legitimate currency. “I don’t believe that bitcoin is going to be a currency today or in the future. I’m talking about the new technology of blockchain and the possibility of what could happen not in the near terms, but in a few years from now,” added Schultz. 5 cryptocurrencies under $5>> Despite being confident in the technology, Schultz reiterated that his company has no specific plans to launch its own cryptocurrency right now and it’s still trying to understand the crypto world. Even so, we can’t rule out the possibility that Starbucks may test out a virtual currency in the near future, as today’s statements pretty much confirm that the company is headed in that direction. This is not the first time Schultz has brought up the idea of a cashless payment system. In a CNBC interview last month, he mentioned that he could envision a future where the coffee chain becomes a “cashless retailer” and believes “that time is nearer than you think.” Read about the largest crypto hack ever>> Featured Image: Twitter ",26-Jan,2018
" Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital currencies started gaining popularity last year following the big tech companies’ interest in blockchain technologies. Moreover, cryptocurrencies’ ability to execute transactions semi-anonymously has added to the popularity. Consequently, people who want their transactions to be hard to trace enjoy the secrecy these digital currencies offer. According to researchers from the University of Sydney, almost 44% of Bitcoin transactions were used for illegal purposes and 25% of all traders used Bitcoin for illicit reasons. The research further shows that these Bitcoin traders are expected to make close to 36 million transactions each year. Do KYCs make the crypto market unfair? >> “Our paper suggests that a significant component of the intrinsic value of bitcoin as a payment system derives from its use in facilitating illegal trade,” the researcher said. The researchers’ findings certainly seem true. The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has declined from $830 billion to around $550 billion in the last couple of weeks, driven down by regulatory concerns that may, in part, be resulting from this illegal activity. Beware the Bitcoin ATM >> Bitcoin is currently selling at $10,922 after briefly dipping below the $10,000 mark on regulatory worries last week. The latest selloff has reduced Bitcoin’s total market capitalization to $183 billion, down significantly from the all-time high of $330 billion.   On the other hand, several fund managers believe the movement in Bitcoin price is purely based on speculation and that the coin does not have any underlying value or future fundamentals. The chief executive of Vanguard, Tim Buckley,  said, “Bitcoin’s value is based off scarcity, an artificial scarcity that’s out there.” He further added, “It’s really tough to imagine where the long-term returns come from, other than speculation.” 5 cryptocurrencies under $5 >> Ripple (XRP) is among those cryptocurrencies that are likely to create its own underlying value. Ripple continues to make partnerships with payment services companies to improve their transaction time and reduce the transaction charges.

" It has been well known that Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz is not a big fan of bitcoin. At the World Economic Forum annual meeting taking place this week in Davos, Switzerland, he told Bloomberg reporters that bitcoin serves no function other than being useful in illicit activities such as money laundering and tax evasion. Just yesterday, Bill Browder spoke out about the ‘death of bitcoin‘! His rationale is based on his belief that bitcoin is no better than the dollar as a medium of exchange, and the cryptocurrency is basically there to solve a problem that never existed. “We have a good medium of exchange called the dollar,” stated Stiglitz. “We can trade in that. Why do people want bitcoin? For secrecy.“ The economist explained that the global banking system is already implementing digital payment technologies, so having bitcoin is just unnecessary. On top of reiterating his aversion for the cryptocurrency, Stiglitz also called for bitcoin to be regulated. “My feeling is that when you regulate it so that you couldn’t engage in money laundering and all these other things, there would be no demand for bitcoin,” he added. “So by regulating the abuses, you are going to regulate it out of existence.” Stiglitz was also joined by Swiss National Bank chairman Thomas Jordan, who gave a speech on why tough restrictions should be placed on bitcoin. “There is an important principle: Similar activities should be similarly regulated, and bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have some characteristics of other investment instruments,” Jordan told listeners. In a previous interview conducted in November 2017, Stiglitz condemned the cryptocurrency and said it was “successful only because of its potential for circumvention [and] lack of oversight.” Stiglitz is only one of many famous economists to be super skeptical of bitcoin. Last year, Robert Shiller, another Nobel Prize winner, described bitcoin as “the best example of a bubble” and considered its valuation “exceptionally ambiguous.” Here’s what others in the financial world are saying about bitcoin.

" Those who follow the music industry know that Curtis Jackson — better known by his stage name 50 Cent — was at one time considered one of the most successful and wealthy rappers on the planet. But little do we know is that some of his vast wealth (despite controversies surrounding his bankruptcy filing in 2015) can now be attributed to bitcoin. Back in 2014, 50 Cent became the first in the industry to accept bitcoin as payment for his album “Animal Ambition.” At that time, bitcoin was valued only around $662 per BTC. According to a report by TMZ, 50 Cent collected approximately 700 bitcoins from album sales — equivalent to about $420,000. In an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session on Reddit following the album release, 50 Cent talked about accepting bitcoin as a way to “stay with the times.” Seeing how bitcoin’s value shot up over the past year, we can probably guess how much money the rapper has made since acquiring the coins. Even at a floor price of $10,000 per BTC, 50 Cent’s coins would have a value of $7 million. Essentially, he has made millions of dollars from collecting bitcoins from his 2014 album sale. 50 Cent has been known for making shrewd investments in the past. Over a decade ago, the rapper bought a minority stake in Vitamin Water, which was subsequently acquired by Coca-Cola for $4.1 billion in 2007. 50 Cent reportedly walked away with somewhere between $60 million and $100 million from that deal. Delighted by the latest revelation, 50 Cent even posted a screenshot of the TMZ article on his Instagram feed. Commenting on the Instagram post, he wrote: “Not Bad for a kid from South Side, I’m so proud of me.”  Given that bitcoin hasn’t been doing too well lately and its price is still volatile, it might be a good idea for him to cash out while the opportunity is there, as suggested by TMZ.

Stripe product manager Tom Karlo released a gentle-yet-cutting blog post this afternoon outlining the company’s decision to break up with the world’s largest cryptocurrency. ‘Over the past year or two,’ he explains, ‘Bitcoin has evolved to become better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange.’ Not entirely useful for a payment application, therefore. Karlo goes on to explain that ‘substantially’ higher transaction times and an increase in failure rates have led to a decrease in customer desire to use the coin on the Stripe platform.

Governments have begun introducing legislation to regulate digital currency trading, causing investors to step back. But don’t start writing a furious e-mail just yet. For those of you who trade frequently with Bitcoin via Stripe, there is still plenty of time to make some last-minute transactions.

In addition, Stripe remain ‘very optimistic about cryptocurrencies overall’, and suggest that they are interested in enabling support for ‘promising’ cryptocurrency efforts in the future. So it’s not all doom and gloom. >>Proof-of-Stake Can Save Cryptocurrency Stripe, like Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL), is an online payment system whereby users can accept transfers online and in mobile apps. The Irish company have business clients around the world and handle billions of dollars per year. It isn’t the first company to decide to start and then stop accepting Bitcoin as a payment method; Valve’s ‘Steam’ gaming platform ended Bitcoin support on December 7th last year amid market volatility. Bitcoin was in the green today after yesterday’s slump, reaching a peak of $11,377.60 USD. Featured Image: Mashable",23-Jan,2018
" Most of the world at this point has formed an opinion on digital currency bitcoin (BTC). Not everyone is willing to share their thoughts with the masses, especially about something that is so new and so controversial. Is bitcoin a speculative bubble or is it not? There are different indications every day but, there are others who have pretty strong opinions. Former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair, Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller, and even JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon have all shared their thoughts. So who else is speaking out? The latest to speak out about the virtual currency is Bill Browder, the CEO of Hermitage Capital, which is an investment fund company that focuses primarily on Russian markets. In an interview with CNBC, Mr. Browder stated that he knows what the death of bitcoin will be.  There are a lot of people hoping bitcoin will fail, and there are a lot of people guessing in what way will the cryptocurrency come to the end of its life, and Browder, while not a pessimist, believes that there are a few reasons which suggest that bitcoin will one day come to an end.  In particular, Browder stated that bitcoin is “a way for bad dictators or criminals to bypass sanctions.” Translation? Bitcoin can be incredibly useful when it comes to criminal activity, while, in turn, will be “the death of it and other cryptocurrencies.”  He added that there will come a point in time where cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin, will lose all that makes them so appealing to investors right now.  Browder has a point. Bitcoin, because it is not regulated, is susceptible to money laundering and other sorts of criminal activity, which is why there are certain countries fighting for more regulation over the virtual currency.  Every day is different. Sometimes bitcoin is dropping, other times it looks like it’s making a comeback. Today is the latter.  At the time of writing, bitcoin managed to climb its way above the $11,000 mark today, after dropping marginally in the early hours of the morning.  Personally, it’s hard to say the direction that bitcoin is heading in the next couple weeks. For the sake of investors, I hope that it continues to gain momentum.

" If you’re an investor anguishing at the performance of bitcoin lately, there may be more bad news on the way. Today, Goldman Sachs issued a warning against the cryptocurrency, affirming that there is “no doubt” that bitcoin’s meteoric rise over the past year has “pushed it into bubble territory.” Goldman Sachs also compared last year’s bitcoin frenzy to the renowned dot-com era of the late 1990s and the Dutch “tulipmania” of the 17th century. The investment banking firm believes that this “bitcoin bubble” could get much bigger than its historical comparables.  Source: MarketWatch Analysts at Goldman Sachs view the extreme price volatility of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin as a big indication that a big crash could be on the cards. They also pointed out that as the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, bitcoin does not actually fulfil the role it sets out to do. In a research report issued to investors, Goldman Sachs analysts stated: “We think the concept of a digital currency that leverages blockchain technology is viable given the benefits it could provide: ease of execution globally, lower transaction costs, reduction of corruption since all transactions could be traced, safety of ownership, and so on. But bitcoin does not provide any of these key advantages.” According to the report, the difference in bitcoin prices between exchanges at the same time could reach as high as $4,000 just because a single bitcoin transaction takes a long time to process. This means a buyer could be paying 31% more for one BTC on one exchange than another. In addition to bitcoin, Goldman Sachs also gave a similar verdict on other cryptocurrencies such as ether and ripple. “While we do not know if bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency will double or triple from prevailing prices, we do not believe that these cryptocurrencies will retain their value in the long run in their current incarnation,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. However, the good news is that Goldman Sachs is still positive about the blockchain technology in general and is considering building a trading platform for bitcoin. As well, analysts do not expect a major crash in bitcoin to cause “major contagion effects on the global economy or financial markets.“ Featured Image: twitter",23-Jan,2018
" The cryptocurrency market has been in turmoil over the past few days, as governments around the world begin to enforce regulations over coin transfers. Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $10,000 USD on January 17th, for the first time since December 1st (though it is now recovering), and Coinmarketcap has been a sea of red, prompting many reports to describe it as the cryptocurrency ‘bloodbath’. Hyperbolic, maybe, but scary enough if you’ve just invested all the money you were saving up to buy a yacht with.  It’s all very interesting, but amongst all the noise it’s easy to overlook an even more concerning development taking shape within the cryptocurrency industry; one that no amount of smart trading or governmental regulation will fix if we leave it too late.  As we all know, Bitcoins do not come from out of nowhere. Like gold, oil, coal and other valuable commodities, it must be mined. In this case, using computers. And computers tend to use electricity. In fact, according to the Digiconomist’s energy consumption index, Bitcoin mining computers got through around 43.74TWh per year worth of the stuff as of today. To put that into perspective, many members of the Bitcoin community paid some attention to a research paper from UK-based Powercompare last November, which stated that at the time, electricity usage for Bitcoin mining equated to 0.13% of the entire planet’s energy consumption. This is more than the country of Ireland uses per year. It is more than Nigeria, Africa’s largest economy, uses per year. It is more than 159 other countries in the world use per year. ‘If Bitcoin miners were a country’, say Powercompare, ‘they’d rank 61st in the world in terms of energy consumption.’ All of this speaks for itself, but it’s old news. Because at the time the paper was released, Bitcoin’s energy consumption stood at 29.05TWh. That means that since late November 2017, less than two months ago, the amount of power used by Bitcoin mining has increased by 50.5%. That is an unbelievable increase in such a short amount of time, and it’s rising exponentially.  
Uh-oh. Source As of 28th November 2017, Bitcoin energy use had increased by just under 30% that past month. At that rate, it would consume the entire world’s energy supply by 2020. Considering today’s statistic, this is getting alarming.  If environmental issues don’t tend to worry you, consider that not only is this bad for the planet, it’s bad for trading. China’s recent power restrictions on mining operations is putting pressure on miners who want to continue producing coins. Bitmain, one of China’s leading mining companies, is planning on leaving the country and setting up elsewhere due to the regulations. And even if all the miners do move elsewhere, would other countries happily accommodate such high power demand for long? Okay, you get it, it’s a problem. So what do we do about it? The issue with Bitcoin’s protocol is that it uses what’s known as a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm. In essence, this means that every miner must do ‘work’ (using computing power to solve a mathematical problem in order to produce more coins and complete transactions) to add new blocks onto the blockchain system. A block is ‘solved’ every 10 minutes, and out of everyone who tried, only one miner succeeds. They then get the transaction fees and new coins as a reward. The others are informed and their work discarded, despite the colossal power that went into trying to solve the math problem first.  But there is an alternative. Other consensus algorithms, such as proof-of-stake, exist to do essentially the same thing in a different way. With proof-of-stake (PoS), one user (called a ‘forger’ in POS terms) is chosen from a pool to create the next block on the chain, instead of everyone frantically trying to solve a math problem and do it first. This saves an enormous amount of energy. Forgers are chosen based on the stake they have in the system – the number of coins they have and how long they have had them for. They are not rewarded by coins created but they are paid in transaction fees.  And it’s catching on. In fact, some well-known coins with huge market caps have been using PoS for ages. NEO, which normally sits comfortably among the top 10 cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap, currently has a cap of $7.6 billion USD, while the developer-based coin Lisk (LSK) sits on a cap of $2.3 billion USD. Both coins run on a PoS-based algorithm, and, though suffering the same general market price plummet that most cryptocurrencies are, have more value and trading volume than many PoW-based coins. Up-and-coming alt-coins have spotted the benefits of PoS, too. Philosopher Stones (PHS) coins ranked amongst the top three highest gaining coins on January 17th, while reaching a market cap of $1.63m USD later that week, a stunning increase from $459k a couple of days before. Philosopher Stones use the proof-of-stake algorithm as part of their ‘green mining’ initiative, noting that ‘the only equipment you need for minting new coins is your PC or even laptop’. Interestingly, they allow transaction messages on their blockchain network and also offer a 50% year return reward.  Coinmarketcap.com, 17/01/2018 Also, enter EcoCoin (ECO). It is smaller than PHS with a market cap of $235,161 USD but no less ambitious. It, too, uses Proof-of-Stake to validate its transactions. The coin is, in their own words, ‘a cryptocurrency and community focused on protecting and honoring our environment.’ It’s strongly unlikely that this will take the form of storming oil tankers á la Greenpeace, so don’t put off your investments just yet. Since launching, they have made a good deal of progress through their roadmap, establishing Windows and Linux wallets, listing on multiple exchanges and celebrating their website launch. Looking to become a platform for charity donations, recycling rewards, crowd-sourcing and an eco-marketplace, EcoCoin is designed to be a PoS-based coin with a huge audience.     But even if your heart is set on PoW-based coins such as Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin, there are still ways to mine them without pushing national grids to the limit. HydroMiner, an Austrian-based Bitcoin mining operation, is making use of disused hydropower reserves in the country to power their servers. In addition, equipment is cooled by the cold mountain water circulating through pipes – a more efficient alternative than conventional air conditioning. Excitingly, they are currently planning an ICO to expand outside of Austria. We also have Pylon Network, an ingenious Spanish start-up which looks to reward users in its own cryptocurrency for solar power generation. The blockchain-enabled platform will enable the decentralized exchange of green energy for Pylon-coin. In addition, validating transactions will take place with ‘green miners’; servers that are run on excess renewable energy.  It’s easy to overlook the smaller coins and ICOs that are trying to push the industry in a different direction. But it’s all the more reason to think about investing now, while prices are low. It is normal to have doubts about economic viability, but it might be time to start thinking about the bigger picture; whether the giant PoW-based coins are actually sustainable in real terms. In any case, the issue of power consumption is in everyone’s hands, and if it isn’t paid immediate attention, Bitcoin will be the least of our worries.

" It was once said that opportunity often comes disguised in the form of misfortune. Though it is one of the biggest cryptocurrency hotbeds on the planet, Nigeria’s bitcoin mania actually took off because of an infamous Ponzi scheme that roped in millions of Nigerians from late 2015 to the end of 2016. The Mavrodi Mondial Moneybox (MMM) scam, which first started in Russia and lasted as long as 30 years, promised investors a 30% return in as little as 30 days. When the Nigerian government started cracking down on accounts linked with the scheme, MMM operators were able to cut out the banks and started to require investors to use bitcoins. At the end of 2016, MMM suspended its payouts to investors, causing an estimated three million people in Nigeria to lose their money. But out of all that chaos, something fascinating happened: people realized that bitcoin was just as valuable as money — that bitcoin is the future. According to Lucky Uwakwe, co-founder of Blockchain Solutions Ltd., a cryptocurrency firm in Lagos: “It was MMM that made Nigerians understand how Bitcoin worked.” Today, Nigerians are trading about $4.7 million worth of bitcoin a week, up from about $300,000 per week a year ago. This number puts Nigeria at No. 23 globally, comparable to the volume of activity in Chinese yuan or Indian rupees. “The growth has been crazy,” said David Ajala, who runs NairaEx, one of about a dozen digital currency exchanges in Nigeria. “It took us two years to get 10,000 customers. Within the last year, we’ve added 90,000.” Because of Nigeria’s high fraud rates, online sellers do not process payments from Nigerian credit cards. This is why bitcoin has become an attractive option for consumers there. With bitcoin, there aren’t any costly chargebacks, and on the basis of transaction origin, it can’t be blocked. The majority of Nigerians keep it as an alternative asset class by using it as a store of value. In addition, as many emerging market currencies are struggling against the U.S. dollar, investors began using bitcoin as a hedge against the local currency depreciation. Bitcoin Scams are Prevalent in Nigeria MMM was just one of the many scams to flood a nation that’s notorious for criminal activities of this sort. With bitcoin quickly gaining popularity, the rise of scams involving the cryptocurrency was inevitable. Phony traders have inundated Nigeria’s cryptocurrency exchanges, messaging apps, and even the streets of every city in Nigeria, pledging fast and guaranteed returns to civilians and disappearing once they’ve taken their money. “A lot of people have had their fingers burned,” said Adeolu Fadele, founder of the Cryptographic Development Initiative of Nigeria, a group that aims to educate regulators and the public about digital currency. Most of these scams follow the same pattern: a potential victim would receive a message from a supposedly beleaguered Nigerian prince, and the target is asked to wire over money in exchange for bitcoin. In some cases, the scammer uses the ID of a real dealer and creates a trading profile on a local exchange that’s good enough to pass a cursory background check, a technique known as cloning. Others will make an offer not of bitcoin, but of “billion coin” or some other non-existent cryptocurrency. “Everybody I know has been scammed in one way or another,” says Bashir Aminu, a digital-security expert and bitcoin enthusiast in Lagos. Like in any other Ponzi scheme, the early investors in Nigeria’s bitcoin scams get paid with the money coming from subsequent investors. Since this kind of manoeuvre relies on new sign-ups, the scheme would collapse if no new investors are drawn in. To combat these scams involving something that’s not properly regulated, Nigeria has started developing informal groups of traders and follow an old-school approach to verify transactions. For instance, after seeing his friends lose thousands of dollars to scammers, bitcoin fanatic Aminu set up an informal exchange on the messaging app Telegram that would allow him and his friends to trade among themselves. Anyone else who seeks to join the group would need to go through a review procedure, where Aminu would look at their ID and banking documents and compare the papers in face-to-face meetings. Sometimes, he would even act as a trusted broker, holding a buyer’s money in escrow until the seller came through with the bitcoin transfer. According to Aminu, his group has grown to almost 800 members over the past year, and there are dozens of similar networks out there. Some networks arrange face-to-face meetings in homes, the backs of small shops, and other private places, where a buyer hands over cash and watches the seller make the bitcoin transfer over a smartphone. This kind of facilitation is pretty similar to those black market exchanges taking place all over the streets of Nigeria. As these informal networks grow and multiply, they would become increasingly populated by people who trade digital currency as a full-time occupation. Because of all of this informal trading, the size of Nigeria’s market is probably even bigger than what’s being reported. The emergence of informal networks in Nigeria has fortified the value of not just bitcoin but cryptocurrency in general to Nigerian investors, especially as the local currency continues to undergo wild swings. “For many, the potential profit is too good to pass up,” said Smart Oluwadola, a cryptocurrency peddler in Kano, a desert city in northern Nigeria. In August, a friend persuaded him to ditch a job hawking health supplements for a suspiciously pyramidal “business club” and buy a couple hundred dollars’ worth of bitcoin. His investment is now worth thousands of dollars.  “If you don’t take a risk, you can’t get anything,” said Oluwadola. “And if it’s going to be the future of currency, then you better start now.” As those living in any politically and economically unstable country could tell you, anything that leads to money entails its fair share of deceptions and unlawfulness that the government would rather turn a blind eye to, let alone fix. The cryptocurrency enthusiasts in Nigeria are doing everything possible to make sure this market is clean and absent of fraudulence — even it means following the most primitive and uninspiring method possible.

" The crypto market is in a shambles the past couple of weeks as swathes of governmental regulations give investors cold feet. After last weekend failed to reinvigorate the market, many enthusiasts will be wondering where to look for some positive news. It may be on the way… Russia is a bit of a lone wolf as far as politics are concerned. As cryptocurrencies begin to tug at the strings of national and international affairs, the country will surely be thinking carefully about how to play its hand in regards to crypto regulation. Speculation abounded last year as Russian president Vladimir Putin met with Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin as part of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. Mr. Putin allegedly “supported the idea of establishing ties with possible Russian partners,” which, though vague, sounds positive.  >>Are Institutional Investors to Blame for the Latest Bitcoin Sell Off? In addition, Dmitry Marinichev, Mr. Putin’s internet advisor, is a huge supporter of Bitcoin. Indeed, news of his huge mining operation, located in an old Soviet car factory, garnered interest last year. Russia may be an ideal location for Bitcoin mining, given the long, cold winters (great for keeping the hardware cool) and cheap electricity. People are beginning to notice. As China continues to put pressure on crypto miners in the country, many of them are starting to see Russia as an appealing alternative. According to a November 2017 report by Bitcoin News, 40 companies from China and the EU have sent applications to the Russian Association of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (RACIB) to begin mining operations in the country.  All this being said, it is inevitable that Russia will place some regulations on cryptocurrency. Even the most financially liberal country is bound to be uncomfortable with totally unregulated flows of cash, particularly where large corporations are concerned. And Russia has certainly been very sceptical in the past, going so far as to consider jail time of up to 7 years for cryptocurrency users back in 2016. And as recently as October 2017, Russia’ central bank announced plans to restrict access to online cryptocurrency exchange websites. Despite all this, nothing concrete seems to have come to fruition yet. So what’s going on?  In recent weeks, Putin certainly seems to have come to a more level conclusion on the subject. According to Russian news agency TASS, Putin last week said that some kind of regulation will ‘definitely’ be required in future, though he acknowledged that Bitcoin et al “can be a settlement medium to a certain degree and in certain situations. This is done quickly and efficiently.” >>Bitcoin or Gold? Why Investors Should Consider Both in the Current Market Evidently, Russia is staying their hand on cryptocurrency regulation for the moment, and it is no coincidence that it is reportedly developing its own in the meantime. The so-called ‘cryptorouble’ being developed by the Kremlin will likely be investigated as a way to conduct global exchanges of cash while bypassing international sanctions. In addition, the Bank of Russia last year announced that it is now working with masterchain technology. Deputy Governor Olga Skorobogatova said: “We are planning to consider the use of the Masterchain prototype as a component of the new-generation financial infrastructure in the future.” This certainly suggests that the country is seeing the benefits of cryptocurrency and the innovations it comes with. In any case, the term ‘regulation’ is getting increasingly warped within cryptocurrency circles. While it is true that market prices take steep dives every time a country introduces new legislation to control the use of Bitcoin and its rivals, it does not necessarily mean an outright ban or threat of criminal charges. Russia’s Ministry of Finance announced that it was drafting a bill to regulate, or ‘legalize’, Bitcoin trading on certain platforms last December, with Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev stating that it “supports the legalization of trade on official exchanges”, despite it not being technically illegal at the moment…  If all of this sounds extremely contradictory, that’s because it is. The Kremlin has constantly altered its stance on cryptocurrency over the past couple of years, but presently it seems as though it’s beginning to reach some kind of conclusion. Russia’s headstrong approach in world affairs may see it taking a more lax attitude to cryptocurrencies as the West mulls over tighter control. The coming months will tell. Bitcoin currently has a market cap of $173,643,993,145 USD and is currently trading at $10,323.80 USD, down -9.68% from yesterday.  Featured Image: Twitter",22-Jan,2018
" Bitcoin (BTC) continues to fluctuate. The rise and fall has been driven by regulatory concerns and analyst’s comments. A brief rally over the weekend sent bitcoin prices from below $10,000 to $13,000. However, this was short-lived; the bitcoin price collapsed again during Monday trade. Traders blamed regulatory concerns from South Korea, India, and the European Union for the latest plummet. Currently trading at just above $11,500, Bitcoin is down 11% from the previous close.  Several Indian banks have suspended cryptocurrency exchange accounts in order to control money laundering and the transfer of money from India to other destinations. The Indian finance minister, Arun Jaitley, has already denounced digital currencies and the government is now taking necessary actions to stop cryptocurrency trading. In a bid to control the massive growth in cryptocurrency prices, the European Union has signaled strong initiatives to end the bitcoin bubble. Valois Dombrovskis, vice president of the European Commission, has cited “clear risks for investors and consumers associated to price volatility”. The European Union has appointed Central bank Deputy Governor Jean-Pierre Landau to suggest ways to regulate digital currencies. In a separate report, Nordea Bank, the largest Northern European financial services group, has banned their employees from cryptocurrency trading. Although South Korea hasn’t yet announced a complete ban on cryptocurrency trading, they have implemented new taxes on cryptocurrencies. Several investors are pleased with the government’s decision of introducing taxes instead of banning the digital currencies. According to reports, the country has imposed a 22% corporate tax and a 2.2% local income tax on cryptocurrency exchanges. They have recently banned anonymous cryptocurrency accounts and prohibited foreign traders to trade virtual currencies in South Korean exchanges. The country has also frozen the opening of new virtual accounts. Despite mixed signals from the South Korean markets, investors are currently showing their concerns over India, which has completely suspended cryptocurrency trading accounts.     Featured Image: twitter",22-Jan,2018
" There have been many speculations as to why Bitcoin (BTC) has seen such high volatility in the past five weeks. Many regulations have come to light from countries that hold the majority of Bitcoin holders, such as China and South Korea. Other speculations have been centered around the unknown affect the Bitcoin futures contracts have on the market and the lastest, the effect that institutional investors have had when they flooded the market. China’s government has been active in its cryptocurrency regulations, as it recently surfaced that it will shut down mining operations due to power shortages. Many speculations have surfaced that it isn’t, in fact, the energy problem that shut down these operations but it was China’s central bank, due to rampant fraud and “money laundering” occurring within the country. As the country now focuses on attempting to cut off access to online platforms used to trade digital currencies, many of its residents are bound to find ways around these new regulations. It is a compelling speculation and one that most seem to be on board with but some are not necessarily convinced.   Source: CoinMarketCap   Futures As you can see from the chart above, Bitcoin has had higher than normal consistent volatility in its price since the first launch of its Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) futures, on December 10th. It reached a record high of over $20,000 a coin, just before the major Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures began and took an immediate bearish turn. It remains unclear by many analysts how these Bitcoin futures have affected the market, but there is no denying that they have in some way. Noelle Acheson, an author from CoinDesk, made an interesting statement before the first Bitcoin futures launched. She said: “But… it’s also possible that the institutional investors that are negative on bitcoin’s prospects (and there’s no shortage of those) may use the futures markets to put money behind their conviction. It’s much easier to sell a futures contract with a lower-than-market price than it is to actually short bitcoin. These investors may well send signals to the actual bitcoin market that sends prices tumbling.” On January 9th, there were a total of 1,907 short position contracts on the CBOE exchange and when these contracts closed, BTC was down 36 percent. Since the price of Bitcoin has since rebounded and is selling above the $12,500 mark. The largest exchange, CME, will have its futures contracts expire this coming Friday. Many will continue to monitor Bitcoin’s price, as Friday closes in. Confirmation of the effect of these futures can only be shown with time.   Institutional Investors Buy-In The most intriguing argument I’ve read to date comes from Georgy Verbitsky, managing director of Russia & CIS at EToro, claiming institutional experienced investors who entered the bitcoin market drove down the price. Verbitsky explains that many understand that the reason for Bitcoin’s price skyrocketing and the influx of the cash flow within the past few months, stemmed from mass-market and pensioners investing. He told RT:  “Experienced investors knew that the bitcoin honeymoon couldn’t last forever. Those who catch the last train are usually punished by the market. Big-time miners and institutional investors understood that they needed to diversify, that they had to get some fiat money.” Verbitsky isn’t convinced that China and South Korean are to blame for the price drop. “It was about pure greed. Of course, after they lost a third to a half of their investments, they pushed the ‘sell’ button,” he said. He goes on to make a compelling point backing his argument, with China’s ban on ICOs back in September. Verbitsky claims that was a much larger blow to bitcoin but the market remained bullish and the hit went completely unnoticed.    What Next?
Verbitsky makes a compelling speculation, one I have not heard yet. While the futures effects continue to be monitored and remain unknown, most shouldn’t worry. Any sort of investment is a gamble but you can say investing in cryptocurrency with its high volatility, is extremely risky. Most invested in Bitcoin are in it for the long haul. If you’ve invested more than you can afford and are extremely concerned, I’d say sell because the volatility isn’t going anywhere. The price of Bitcoin will continue to fluctuate but many trusted financial analysts believe that 2018, will be the year Bitcoin continues to rise. Featured Image: Snip",20-Jan,2018
" Now that we’ve seen how popular Bitcoin (BTC) has become over the past year, there is probably one question that almost every opportunistic investor is now asking: Is bitcoin worth the investment now?  The simple answer to that — of course — depends on one’s background, objectives, and wealth.  But an interesting proposition that’s been thrown around lately revolves around bitcoin becoming a topical investment that could even rival gold. Could bitcoin function in the same way as gold? Could it also be a store of value?  Coincidentally, both assets have roughly similar per-unit values at the moment. So now is a good time to ask these questions. To provide the answers, we must look at some of bitcoin’s key characteristics that make it attractive to investors. It is well documented that the bitcoin virtual currency has a limited supply — 21 million to be exact. Recently, reports came out informing the market that 80% of the world’s BTC has been mined, with approximately 4.2 million still remaining out there. In comparison, the supply of gold is said to increase by 1% to 2% annually.  Just by using the law of supply and demand, we can extrapolate that bitcoin’s value hinges largely on its demand. A perfectly inelastic supply — when all coins have been mined — signifies that any movement in bitcoin’s demand would directly affect its price without any part of the supply curve offsetting the demand-induced price movement. This is one plausible explanation (using market dynamics in economics) for bitcoin’s volatile; it is super sensitive to demand shifts. Because its supply is set at a certain amount, there is a good chance bitcoin will become increasingly valuable as demand continues to go up like it did for the past year. Remember, the global population is also growing, so the number of bitcoin consumers can only rise. Because it is a virtual currency, bitcoin is extremely convenient to buy and easy to carry around. This has both its pros and cons. On the bright side, every transaction involving bitcoin happens quickly, particularly those involving large sums of money, and its users can benefit from the anonymity of ownership, such that bitcoin can be used in all sorts of purchases. This makes bitcoin especially valuable in the black market. On the downside, because it’s virtual, bitcoin is more vulnerable to disruptions to its system (i.e. hacks), therefore potentially losing all its value. Moreover, bitcoin’s benefits can only be realized by a select group of people in the society — those who are tech-savvy. For the older generations, even the concept behind bitcoin eludes them, segregating them from the world of cryptocurrency. For the most part, bitcoin is considered a decentralized entity not subject to any government regulations. Again, this is both good and bad. While decentralization allows all members of the bitcoin community to engage in the mining and verification process, it does create problems that can only be mitigated by governing authorities. For example, without regulation, transactions in the black market, as well as money laundering using bitcoin, would be left uncontrolled. Remember the story in 2015 about the arrest of the owner of the Silk Road website and how bitcoin was involved in that ordeal? This is why some jurisdictions are pushing for cryptocurrency laws to tackle these issues. Indeed, bitcoin offers our society another choice of currency that’s both secure and easy to use with the potential to appreciate, but does that make it a good store of value compared to gold? For this, we must consider how their values would look years down the road.  Source: coindesk.com Looking at their historical prices, there’s a telling story: Bitcoin has a much higher variation over the past three years than gold, but overall it is trending upwards, while gold stayed relatively flat. This says a lot about the risks involved with these assets. Obviously, Bitcoin has a higher risk, though its value could keep going up especially as it is even rarer than gold. Also, the problem some have with bitcoin isn’t about its volatility, but how the volatility would hinder its path towards becoming real money. On the other hand, gold can be considered a relatively safer investment, especially as it has been around for thousands of years — nothing is going to hurt its status as the #1 precious metal. As an investor, you want to know your investment horizon when making a judgment. As seen over the past few months, bitcoin does fluctuate. Hence, those investing in the short term would have a higher chance of profiting from bitcoin. “For more than 5,000 years gold and silver have been tried-and-true money. They’ve lasted basically the duration of organized civilization,” said Dave Kranzler of Investment Research Dynamics. In the long run, both assets would likely go up but for different reasons. For bitcoin, its limited supply and the rising popularity of digital currency right now would certainly boost its value. As for gold, investors would always view it as a good hedge against inflation and the stock market, which was traditionally its most common use. Former PayPal president David Marcus once gave his own view on bitcoin: “I really like bitcoin. I own bitcoins. It’s a store of value, a distributed ledger. It’s a great place to put assets, especially in places like Argentina with 40% inflation, where $1 today is worth 60 cents in a year, and a government’s currency does not hold value. It’s also a good investment vehicle if you have an appetite for risk. But it won’t be a currency until volatility slows down.” The security breaches in the virtual world could be seen as the biggest fear factor for those buying bitcoin. No one can change the fact that bitcoin is a man-made entity, and anything created by humans has its own implicit uncertainties. Some also argue that bitcoin is “easy to get in but hard to get out”. In addition, interference by regulatory authorities has always caused fears in the cryptocurrency space. A government crackdown could hit bitcoin’s value depending on the nature and magnitude of change imposed. If one’s looking for a safe and reliable investment, gold would easily be one of the ideal candidates. The only major problem investors have is that it is not as transferable as fiat money, and certainly much more difficult when compared to bitcoin. Imagine you need to make a deal involving tens of kilograms of gold, someone would need to transfer that. Plus, there’s a possibility that it could get stolen on its way. So the speed in which gold can be used as a medium of exchange is not optimal in many cases. Whatever what your investment goals are, both bitcoin and gold are assets that have value in the future. In fact, as mentioned, gold can be a hedge against many things, and cryptocurrency may be one of those. This week, the market saw an influx of money pouring into gold purchases, with 30,000 kilograms sold on January 17, due to the cryptocurrency market (including bitcoin) being down for consecutive days.  Source: Bloomberg Therefore, one way to regard the “bitcoin vs. gold” argument is to see them as complements that diversify one’s portfolio.  On one hand, investing solely in bitcoin presents a “high-risk, high-reward” scenario, while putting all eggs in the gold basket is much safer but has a lower growth ceiling. This is tantamount to choosing between equity in a rising sector and bonds. In the end, the investment decision and allocation really depend on how aggressive an investor wants to be.

" Most people have an opinion on bitcoin at this point in time. But it is hard to maintain a steady outlook on the digital currency due to the fact that the price is starting to fluctuate almost at a daily rate.  It’s for these reasons that people are calling bitcoin a speculative bubble. The latest to join in on the conversation is Robert Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale University, located in New Haven, Connecticut.  In the past, Shiller has been fairly vocal on where he stands when it comes to bitcoin. In fact, several months ago, the Nobel Laureate stated that the digital currency “has no value at all unless there is some common consensus that it has value.”  Further, he also stated in September of last year that bitcoin is the “best example of a bubble.”  That being said, it seems Shiller is neither for bitcoin now nor is he against it – he seems genuinely at a loss for words when it comes to the currency. Yesterday, Shiller said in an interview with CNBC that he “doesn’t know what to make of Bitcoin ultimately.”  Shiller might be confused, and he might still believe that the currency will one day implode, like many other well-known figures believe, but he did say that whether bitcoin collapses and is forgotten, he suspects that the cryptocurrency “could linger on for a good long time,” adding that the collapse could be here “in 100 years.”  Can you imagine another 100 years of this? Another 100 years of constantly waking up to see whether or not the price of bitcoin has dropped – like it has been as of late – or if it soared.  I don’t know about you, but I’m not sure I could take another 100 years of that. Featured Image: Facebook",19-Jan,2018
" Fortunately, investors are pretty adapted with the big swings in the prices of cryptocurrencies. In fact, they believe in generating value from these movements. The movement of Cryptocurrencies remains soft in Friday trade after the dramatic last few sessions. Bitcoin pared previous losses, but the currency struggles to break the physiological mark of $12,000. Bitcoin was trading around $11,587.30, down 2.5% over the previous day. There were a lot of optimistic and downbeat news’ surrounding the market in Friday trade; traders are eagerly waiting for the final announcement from South Korea. Morgan Stanley’s (NYSE:MS) move of clearing the Bitcoin futures has raised trader’s sentiments, as this move will permit institutional investors to take part in the cryptocurrency trading. After the move, Morgan Stanley joined Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in legitimizing bitcoin futures. However, Morgan Stanley’s management hasn’t yet completely explained their plan whether they are going to take custodial responsibilities or market making. Analysts have a mixed opinion over the Morgan Stanley’s move. Although clearing bitcoin futures would be a low-risk action, but bitcoin’s volatile nature of making huge swings in a single trading session combined with its unregulated status could craft noteworthy systemic risks for the institutions involved. On the other hand, Bitcoin traders are waiting for the news from South Korea to make their future trading strategies. South Korea is the third largest cryptocurrency market. Thus, any new from Korean markets could lead big movements in prices as we have seen in the last two weeks. The renewed concerns amid the potential ban have wiped off almost $200 billion from the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrencies on Wednesday. Bitcoin has hit $9,402.29 on Wednesday, the lowest level since last November. “It’s impossible to ban Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading because the more you regulate, the more it will become popular,” declared Francesco Nazari Fusetti, CEO of Aidcoin and CharityStars. Regulating bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies appear to be a priority for several countries, due to the threat of money laundering, particularly in South Asian emerging markets. Indonesia, which is among the fastest growing south-east Asian country, has recently warned their citizens from cryptocurrency trading. Featured Image: twitter",19-Jan,2018
" Most people have an opinion on Bitcoin at this point. Considering it took both this year and last year by storm, it would be hard not to form an opinion on the virtual currency, whether you are interested in it or not.  But it’s not just enough for the general public to speak out about their opinions on Bitcoin, because, let’s face it, we only really listen to credible and authoritative sources.  Therefore, today we are going to look at what some of the most well-known Bitcoin bulls and bears are saying about the cryptocurrency.  Before we begin, let’s do a little recap on where the digital currency is sitting as of right now and how it has been performing over the course of the past couple of weeks.  After dropping below the $10,000 mark on Tuesday, and then plunging as low as $9,199.59 in early trade yesterday, Bitcoin has now moved back to the $12,000 mark today, which indicates a growth of more than 20% when compared to the previous close.  Taking into consideration the past couple of weeks, today’s move is pretty significant, and I’m sure anyone who is pro-bitcoin is reasonably happy, but I can’t help but wonder if the price of bitcoin will ever move past $19,000 like it did on December 10 of last year.  As mentioned, we like to listen to credible sources when it comes to our financial decisions. The problem when it comes to bitcoin is that it seems that these sources are divided into two parties: those who are for bitcoin, and those who are against it.  For this article, we are going to be looking at what each party has been saying as of late.  First, we have Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat, who just opened up in an interview with CNBC on Thursday in which he stated that he forecasts that bitcoin will hit $25,000 by the end of this year.  This is pretty significant considering Lee had initially forecasted that the currency wouldn’t reach this market until the year 2020.  Another credible source that has spoken publicly about bitcoin is Peter Thiel, entrepreneur and investor, who stated back in November that anyone who is criticizing bitcoin is “underestimating it,” adding that bitcoin is a “reserve form of money,” comparing it to gold and stating that “it’s just store of value” and individuals don’t “need to use it to make payments.”  Last but not least, we have James Gorman, CEO of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), who stated last year that the digital currency is “something more than just a fad,” adding that the entire concept of “anonymous currency is very interesting.”  As mentioned, there are plenty of people hoping – and perhaps praying – for bitcoin to fail. Here are three public figures who have spoken out about bitcoin in a negative tone:  Saudi Arabian billionaire Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal stated in November, “I just don’t believe in this bitcoin thing.” A criticism in its simplest form.  The Prince went on to say that he believes the currency will “implode one day,” and that it doesn’t make sense to him that “this thing is not under control” and “not under the supervision” of a central bank.  Second, former chairman Ben Bernanke stated in November of last year that he doesn’t believe bitcoin will end up being a success because it is a clear “attempt to replace fiat currency and evade regulation and government intervention.” Last but not least, we have Joseph Stiglitz, who is a Nobel Prize-winning professor of economics, and someone I personally look up too.  Stiglitz announced last month that bitcoin should be “outlawed,” stating that it “doesn’t serve any socially useful function.”  Personally, I find it difficult to choose a side when it comes to bitcoin. Some days I think this digital currency is going to continue to climb, and other days I believe that it is just a speculative bubble. At least I’m not alone, however. It seems that most of the world, including our financial leaders, are experiencing the same confliction. What do you think? Yay or nay for bitcoin?  Featured Image: Twitter ",18-Jan,2018
" After the dramatic two days selloff, Bitcoin not only pared earlier losses, but the digital currency generated healthy gains in Thursday’s trade. Bitcoin moved back to the $12,000 mark in Thursday’s trade, signifying a growth of more than 20% compared to the previous close. Bitcoin hit as low as $9,199.59 in early trade on Wednesday. The price pared losses in the evening session and bounced back to the level of $11,188.84 at the end of the day.  Source: CoinMarketCap Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile in nature, evident from the latest sideways movement. Due to the volatile nature, governments all around the world are planning to make strict regulatory requirements for bitcoin and other digital currencies. After a long controversy, there is depressing news’ coming out of South Korea today. In a national policy committee meeting on Thursday, Choi Jong-ku, who is the head of South Korea’s Financial Services Commission said, “The government is considering both shutting down all local virtual currency exchanges or just the ones who have been violating the law.” Along with China, South Korea is leading other global players over crypto regulation, as several countries have already shown their strong concerns over the money laundering with the help of cryptocurrencies.        Answering to reporter’s question, Lee Ju-yeol said, “cryptocurrency is not a legal currency and is not being used as such as of now.”    China is also one of the countries that are making strict regulations for the virtual currency trading. The country is now looking to completely ban any type of centralized trading of digital currencies. South Korea has yet to make clear their stance on cryptocurrency trading. However, Bitcoin and the other digital currencies are moving higher in Thursday trade. There are some analysts who believe in the strength of cryptocurrencies and they see regulations as a favorable step for digital currencies in the long run. “These large drops, usually between the 25-40 percent range, generally find a bottom that is a consolidation of a previous-time high. When this bottom is found, the pattern continues with demand causing a new upward bounce,” said Nolan Bauerle, director of research at CoinDesk. Overall, the short-term future of the cryptocurrency is highly correlated to the final decision of South Korea.   Featured Image: twitter",18-Jan,2018
" Remember Tom Lee? The managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, who once said last year that Bitcoin could reach as high as $25,000 in five years, reiterated his bullish stance on the cryptocurrency in a publication today, stating that even though it plunged by 34% in just two days, Bitcoin’s recent price action can be seen as “normal”. Explaining his rationale, Lee evidenced that the market had seen similar fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price for the past two years. He also pointed out that since mid-2016, there have been six rallies of more than 75% and six sell-offs exceeding 25%.  Source: Business Insider According to Lee: “What happens in years in equity markets is months in the crypto world.” Bitcoin’s price action since mid-2016 (as shown above) has shown that it is able to recover from the kind of drops we’ve seen for the past few days. This chart also resembles those of various tech stocks that have had tremendous growths over the past decade, but as Lee pointed out, any significant movement for Bitcoin happens in much shorter intervals compared to stocks. Based on this, Lee sees now as a great opportunity to “buy the dip” because he believes Bitcoin would eventually reverse back to its previous highs and test new resistance levels. “We think the best way to think about sell-offs is to look at it through the lens of retracements — how much of the prior rise is given back,” Lee wrote. “We view this $9,000 as the biggest buying opportunity in 2018 — and we would be buyers at levels around here.” Coincidentally, Lee’s “prophecy” has come to fruition to some extent, as Bitcoin rallied by approximately 20% as of Thursday morning. But like we’ve noticed with cryptocurrency, this could change at any moment. Beyond Bitcoin, Lee also added that he is extremely bullish on cryptocurrency in general, forecasting that this market could exceed $1.2 trillion. Featured Image: twitter",18-Jan,2018
" Due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, they have a habit of making enormous swings during a single trading session. Cryptocurrencies fell dramatically during early trading on Wednesday, wiping off almost $2 billion from the total market capitalization. At the top of the selloff, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization plunged to $450 billion, sharply lower from an all-time high of above $800 billion. In early Wednesday trading, bitcoin dipped below $10,000 for the first time since early December.  However, bitcoin pared some of the early losses in the evening session, currently trading close to $11,000, lower only 2% from its previous day price. Its price hit the highest level of $20,000 mark on December 17. Discussing the longevity of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Dick Kovacevich, the chairman of Wells Fargo told CNBC: “I think it’s a pyramid scheme. It makes no sense. I’m just surprised it isn’t even lower. I never called it a fraud because there’s no fraudulent thing going on… the fundamentals make no sense.” During Wednesday trading, ethereum price also declined below $800 for the first time since the start of this year. Ethereum was among the best performing virtual currencies since the start of this year, amid its wide acceptance and unique features compared to bitcoin and ripple. The concerns related to the potential ban on cryptocurrency trading in South Korea have jolted its price in the last two sessions. After an early selloff in Wednesday trading, ethereum price recovered the majority of what it had lost. The digital currency is currently trading around $984, down only 1% from the previous close. Traders’ concerns related to strong regulatory requirements have burst cryptocurrency prices in the last two trading sessions. China has already taken strict actions against cryptocurrency trading, while South Korea is preparing a bill to impose tough regulatory requirements. The option of completely banning the cryptocurrency trading is still open, the South Korean minister said in an interview. Although prices recovered late in Wednesday trading, analysts have a bearish outlook for digital currencies.      Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Violka08",17-Jan,2018
" Bitcoin extends the dramatic selloff in Wednesday trade, declined below $10,000 mark for the first time since November 28. The broader selloff was observed in cryptocurrency markets in the last two days, amid concerns over regulators.  Bitcoin lost more than half of its value since hitting the highest level of $20,000 on December 17.  Currently trading around $10,010, bitcoin lost more than 30% of value in the last two days alone.  Other major cryptocurrencies, including ripple (xrp), ethereum (eth), and bitcoin cash (bch) dived at a high double-digit rate in the last two days. Bitconnect was the worst performer, losing more than 95% of price since the start of this week, due to the announcement that it is closing its exchange indefinitely. Digital currency traders all over the world are shorting their positions, while others are sitting tight on the side to see the impact of regulatory uncertainty on prices. The price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies started falling last Wednesday after South Korean minister hinted the potential ban on cryptocurrency trading. Digital currencies have experienced a big blow this week on Tuesday when South Korean minister re-established their tough stance on cryptocurrency trading. In addition, South Korea has already banned creating anonymous cryptocurrency trading accounts. “South Korea will make a decision on a proposed ban on cryptocurrency exchanges after sufficient consultation and coordination of opinions,” the South Korean Minister said on Monday. Although global markets are accelerating on how to regulate cryptocurrencies, China has officially banned every kind cryptocurrency trading. They have also blocked trader’s access to offshore trading platforms that offer cryptocurrency trading. “There is a lot of panic in the market. People are selling to try and get the hell out of there,” said Charles Hayter, founder of Cryptocompare, which owns cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, France, Germany, and Indonesia are planning crackdowns on cryptocurrencies trading in the following days. Governments all over the world fear that crypto markets are turning out to be a haven for money launderers and terrorists. On the whole, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are tumbling on the fears of government’s crackdown along with a wave of selling. Analysts and fund managers are suggesting traders adopt the wait and the see strategy.   Featured Image: twitter",17-Jan,2018
" Avid tech entrepreneur and NBA Dallas Maverick’s owner, Mark Cuban, just tweeted that next season the organization will accept both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) as a form of payment for ticket sales. This all started with a fan asking him on the social media platform when fans of the National Basketball Association would be able to purchase tickets with Bitcoin. However, the Dallas Mavericks won’t be the first NBA team to accept cryptocurrency as a means of payment for tickets. The Sacramento Kings started accepting Bitcoin back in 2014 for promotional products as well as ticket sales. In an interview with Coinbase, Cuban confirmed that they are currently looking into accepting other cryptocurrencies with their new crypto payment ability. Cuban said: “We will also look at accepting tokens from companies we have traditional business relationships with as a way to expand our customer base.” The ABC “Shark Tank” investor is a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space. Back in June of last year, he called Bitcoin a “bubble”, but within months was on the crypto train. Cuban has now invested in a digital currency hedge fund and an ICO (which raised $31 million) and, in August 2017, also launched the Ethereum-based cryptocurrency Mercury Protocol. In October, he was cited as calling cryptocurrencies and blockchain the “future”. In a video named “How To Get Rich” he gave a tip that you should invest 10% of your life savings into Bitcoin and Ethereum. As the entire cryptocurrency market seems to be going through a rough patch these last two weeks, the fact that big-time tech investors such as Mark Cuban and Zuckerberg see prospects of digital currency gives a glimmer of hope. With any market, corrections will occur as well as technical issues, but investors that have been in the game long don’t seem too concerned. Featured Image: dallasnews",16-Jan,2018
" Cryptocurrencies continue to take a beating in China and South Korea – two major markets – as preventative legislation is ramped up to combat what they see as tax evasion and excessive speculation. China has today announced the banning of centralised trading of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies amid an ongoing crackdown, targeting websites and apps that offer trading services. This follows earlier steps such as the banning of ICOs – a form of fundraising whereby new cryptocurrency startups sell their coins – and plans to implement power usage restrictions to mining operations. Since it is now illegal for Chinese residents to engage in any centralized cryptocurrency trading, the only option they have are private over-the-counter exchanges. Meanwhile in South Korea, cryptocurrency traders and investors may face fines if they do not attach their identity to currently anonymous virtual trading accounts, according to a Yonhap news report. This deals a low blow for enthusiasts, many of whom see anonymous finances as a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency ideology. Other preventative measures include: So why are these two countries so determined to tackle cryptocurrencies compared to the countries in the West, where residents and institutions have pretty much free reign to use and trade as much as they like? China is set on ensuring as much money stays within the country as possible. Digital currencies not only provide a channel for money to exit China, but one that is almost completely anonymous and very hard for an external observer to keep track of. Couple this financial control with harsh digital regulation (including, but not limited to, their extreme internet censorship), and it’s not entirely surprising. Ironically, China is not inherently anti-cryptocurrency, having developed coins of their own in the past. Similar to South Korea, they just want to control it.  South Korea’s tightening control is more startling. Crypto trading there is arguably more frenzied than anywhere else in the world. The extent of this is such that prices here often are higher than elsewhere. Though the measures are certainly less rigorous than in China, investors will be feeling the heat as the government mulls over even tighter restrictions.  So what does all this mean for crypto values worldwide? Certainly, knee-jerk reactions to the news caused a slump last week as Bitcoin fell 14% in response to South Korean regulations on January 11th. But the real effect may be more apparent in the long-term, as mining crackdowns begin to squeeze the supply of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. It’s worth considering the deflation effect that this may have.  Featured Image: twitter",15-Jan,2018
" Bitcoin price reversed some of the earlier losses in Monday’s trading, currently trading above the 14,000 level thanks to the trading strategy of buying the digital currency after the dip that some people use. Bitcoin lost considerable value last week, amid uncertainties related to the Chinese and South Korean governments. However, Bitcoin price jumped more than 6% in Monday’s trading, repairing some of the losses it generated last week.  Source Image: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin was standing around $17,468.90 on January 6. However, by January 13, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was selling for $14,237.70, marking a significant loss in price value. Although uncertainty regarding the regulatory authorities continues to impact investor sentiments this week, the majority of cryptocurrencies are still trading in the green today. Bank Indonesia has warned investors about trading in cryptocurrencies. The bank has taken a strict attitude against cryptocurrencies, urging investors to avoid buying, trading, or selling digital currencies. Early this month, Bank Indonesia also imposed a ban on all financial technology companies that were using cryptocurrencies for their transactions. They haven’t entirely banned cryptocurrency trading yet, but they have issued a new warning about it. On the other hand, the South Korean authorities have been silent over the threat of a potential ban since last Thursday. Last week, the South Korean justice minister announced that the government is preparing a bill to ban anonymous cryptocurrency trading. South Korea will make a decision on the proposed ban of anonymous cryptocurrency exchanges after “sufficient consultation and coordination of opinions” has occurred, said the country’s government on Monday. The broader rally was observed in crypto markets after the latest statement from South Korea Bitcoin price has soared above $14,259 in Monday trading after an early selloff. Bitcoin’s market capitalization is now hovering around $239 billion. Last week, Bitcoin lost almost 18% of its market capitalization but seems to now be in an upswing.   Featured Image: twitter",15-Jan,2018
" Bitcoin has gained significant price appreciation last year with few shortfalls, hitting the peak of $19,343 in mid-Dec. However, bitcoin price started tumbling since then and fell to around $12,000 level at the end of the last year. It is currently trading just below $14,000. The price of bitcoin declined more than $2,000 compared to a month ago level, up more than 1,600% over the same period last year.  Source: coinmarketcap.com Several factors added the big swings in bitcoin prices over the last two weeks. Initially, reports of strict regulations and higher taxes on bitcoin miners in China negatively impacted cryptocurrencies.  Moreover, concerns related to the potential ban on cryptocurrency trading from the South Korean government increased the volatility. Although the bitcoin history suggests big swings in a short-time, Warren Buffett expects a bad end for the cryptocurrencies. Investors and analysts seriously fear that the bitcoin bubble could burst anytime. Several major fund managers and renowned investors have been suggesting that investors avoid trading bitcoin, while the Securities Exchange & Commision has informed people to “exercise caution” and be wary of scammers. Buffett said the recent growth in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could have a bad end. On the other hand, John Rogers, the CEO at Ariel Investments, said the price of cryptocurrencies and bitcoin could decline sharply lower in the next five years.  Source: Wall Street Journal Bitcoin is a blockchain technology and it has only an online presence. Moreover, investors don’t have the authority to reverse transactions, making it an eye-catching option for cybercriminals. Several institutional investors are also taking short positions on bitcoin, signifying their bearish outlook. Overall, it appears that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are experiencing obstacles in wider adoption and their use in the real world. Goldman Sachs has also presented similar stance on bitcoin. Goldman Sachs says it is quite difficult for bitcoin to prosper as real money. The substantial volatility and swings in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies prices also suggest that it cannot work as money. Therefore, investors should remain cautious when trading bitcoin and other digital currencies.    Featured Image: twitter",12-Jan,2018
" Ever wanted to buy oceanfront real estate in British Columbia? It will currently cost you around 200 bitcoin today but tomorrow, it might cost you 250. Camilla Stephan-Heck and her husband have decided to accept the highly volatile cryptocurrency in exchange for their beautiful Vancouver Island home. Calculated in dollars, the couple is seeking $2.7 million CAD for their 5 bedroom oceanfront mansion. The dentist and lawyer bought their dream property back in 2001. They listed the home back in November but hadn’t started advertising on cryptocurrency websites until this month.  Mrs. Stephan-Heck said: “We dabble in cryptocurrency ourselves, we’re fairly diversified in our investments, bitcoin was gaining notoriety and we started doing some research. We’ve done reasonably well on it. It’s enough to have fun with.” The couple would accept either a full or partial Bitcoin payment but the real estate agent they’ve decided to use, expects the couple to be paid in CAD. The property is paid in full and the couple are currently waiting for the right offer. There are a dozen other Canadian homes listed for sale on the Bitcoin Real Estate website, including a farm and luxury condos. There is one buyer on the site that is looking for a home in Calgary and is willing to spend $450,000.  However, this isn’t new in the United States as many homes have already been sold in exchange for Bitcoin from Florida to Washington State. Many car dealerships have even begun accepting Bitcoin for luxury vehicles. Newport Beach California’s Lamborghini dealership has accepted payments in Bitcoin since late August of 2017.  It was inevitable that cryptocurrency would be adopted into goods, as many investors found it to be the most frustrating aspect of the digital currency. As returns continued to grow as the cryptocurrency market skyrockets at the last half of 2017, individuals grew frustrated that they were unable to spend their wealth on goods.. VISA and Mastercard have teamed up with projects and there are now cryptocurrency debit cards, that are accepted wherever these major card companies are accepted. The company does the conversion of the transaction and it is no hassle to the retailer. As cryptocurrency continues to grow, we could see more and more goods being bought in digital currency.

" That’s right, you can now buy KFC’s fried chicken with bitcoin in Canada. The fast-food chain is now accepting the cryptocurrency for a limited time for customers to buy a Bitcoin-themed chicken bucket called the “Bitcoin Bucket”. At the same time, KFC will also place a Facebook-based live tracker of the bucket’s price corresponding to the bitcoin-dollar exchange rate. To solve the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, the company has pegged the price of a Bitcoin Bucket at $20, which will be converted into fractions of a bitcoin when a purchase is made. In case you’re wondering how you can walk into a Canadian KFC location and purchase the Bitcoin Bucket, well, you can’t, at least physically. Instead, it is bought online using Bitpay as one of the payment options and the bucket will then be delivered to the customer’s address (though a $5 shipping fee will be charged). Currently, the Bitcoin Bucket is sold out (unfortunately). With this publicity stunt, KFC now joins a fast-growing list of companies to hop on the cryptocurrency bandwagon. The company’s social media team has been updating constantly on Twitter on the status of its mouthwatering Bitcoin Bucket. It has also suggested that other cryptocurrencies may be accepted as well in the future. Regardless of what these crypto-related marketing campaigns do for the profitability of companies, they open up a yet-to-be explored territory for both marketers and consumers that would cause a lot of excitement. We are now seeing bitcoin become mainstream. Featured Image: twitter",12-Jan,2018
" Last year, Jamie Dimon, who is the current CEO of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), disclosed that he was not on board with the hype surrounding the cryptocurrency market, going as far as saying that he will fire any trader involved in trading digital currencies. However, all of that changed on Tuesday, January 9. On Tuesday, Jamie Dimon gave an interview with Fox Business in which he stated that even though he is still skeptical of Bitcoin, he regrets labeling it as a “fraud.”  For those who don’t know, Dimon has been CEO and President of JPMorgan since 2005.  Considering bitcoin was immensely popular throughout 2017, Dimon received a considerable amount of backlash after he made the “bitcoin is a fraud” comment back in September of 2017. Then, in October, just to spite those calling him out for his opinion, Dimon came forward and that he was not going to talk about the virtual currency anymore. That did not last long, however, as he was soon reported as saying that anyone who invests in bitcoin will eventually “pay the price.”  Now Dimon might come across as a little pessimistic when it comes to cryptocurrency, but he has been known for giving praise to blockchain technology, which is essentially the mastermind of bitcoin.  It seems Jamie Dimon is not the only person who feels this way; it seems anyone who is wary of bitcoin has no problem admitting that blockchain, on the other hand, is not a fraud. He told Fox Business on Tuesday that blockchain technology “is real.”  As we move further into 2018, it will be interesting to see if Dimon makes any more changes regarding his opinion on the cryptocurrency market.  What do you think? Do you think it’s true that bitcoin might not be a fraud, but one should still try to stay away from getting heavily involved in the sector? Let me know!

" Bitcoin has extended the selloff in Tuesday’s trade after a sharp decline in the earlier session, amid concerns over the future of digital currencies after the new regulations from the Chinese government. The price of bitcoin has dropped sharply in the early trading session on Tuesday. However, its price gains some momentum in the afternoon session and currently trading just below the $15,000 mark. Although bitcoin declined in the last two trading session, it is still showing strong improvement compared to the level it has seen two weeks ago. Its price declined 4% in the last thirty days, but the price is up 1,545% in the last twelve months. Bitcoin has touched the highest level of $19,850 in mid-December but declined sharply in the next few days to the level of $12,000. Bitcoin has made big swings in the last couple of weeks on the back of mixed reports. The latest volatility in bitcoin prices was the result of strict policies from the Chinese government. According to Reuters and Bloomberg, China seeks to reduce electricity supply to bitcoin miners. China, which is a home for several miners, decided to impose hard regulations on bitcoin and other miners through, taxation, electricity pricing environmental regulations and property laws. Moreover, comments from JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts have also impacted bitcoin prices and traders sentiments. JPMorgan Chase CEO, Jamie Dimon, said bitcoin was a ‘fraud’. Furthermore, the decline in bitcoin’s price over the last two sessions was also supported by CoinMarketCap, which lists cryptocurrencies prices and valuations. The CoinMarketCap has removed data from South Korean exchanges, as the site has witnessed discrepancies from global prices at exchanges in South Korea. Several analysts and market pundits are showing their concerns over the sudden rise in bitcoin value and they expect this bubble to burst anytime in the days to come. On the other hand, the SEC has suggested investors to “exercise caution” and be wary of scammers.  Nevertheless, some investors have a positive view of the future fundamentals of bitcoin. For instance, Eric Lonergan, a macro fund manager at M&G, said big banks will jump on the bitcoin bandwagon and adopt digital currencies like Ripple and ethereum. Featured Image: twitter",9-Jan,2018
" Bitcoin (BTC) has had a rocky 30 days since its futures contracts launched on Wall Street. Despite that, there’s no denying that it was a phenomenal year for the world’s first digital currency.  Source: coinmarketcap.com At press-time, Bitcoin is trading at $17,372.10 a coin, up 13.06% for the day. The digital currency has stayed under the $17,000 mark, for the past two weeks. For the month, BTC is up 44.5% and is up a staggering 1599.59, for the year.  Many analysts predicted that Bitcoin’s surge would come to a halt once its futures rolled out and they were correct. At one point in December just before the first launch of the contracts, Bitcoin was growing over $1,000 a day. Just recently, Bitcoin seems to have gained some steam. Back on Tuesday, the coin was selling at lows of $13,293.80 but seems to have grown $4,000 in just a matter of days, mimicking old habits.  Since Bitcoin’s decline, many altcoins have gained some serious momentum. Ripple (XRP) is now the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap and has just passed the $3.00 mark. Just today, Ethereum (ETH) hit all-time highs selling above $1,000 and is sitting comfortably at the #3 spot.  Tron (TRX) is the latest the make the biggest splash, when it comes to the altcoins, as it is up nearly 9000% in just 30 days. A game was just announced similar to Ethereum’s cryptokitties, called TRON dogs and there has been tremendous buzz since. The Chinese year of the dog is slowly approaching and it seems Chinese investors can’t wait to get there hands on these dogs. Earlier in 2017, if Bitcoin suffered mostly all of the other altcoins suffered. This does not seem to be the case anymore and there’s been much talk around the cryptocurrency space, as to which altcoin will reign supreme in 2018 and take Bitcoin’s place. What do you think?

" Despite the many successes they have experienced this past year, cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin especially, have seen their fair share of controversy. We’ve seen hacks that have lost people a lot of money, stock prices becoming inflated thanks to blockchain investments, fake digital currencies, and who could forget the huge plunge the original cryptocurrency took from near-$20,000 to below $13,000 at the end of December? Now, we bring you the next level – Egypt has banned Bitcoin. Bans on cryptocurrencies have happened before; a country deciding it’s against Bitcoin is nothing new. However, in this particular case, the Egyptian Grand Mufti who ordered the ban hasn’t just declared Bitcoin illegal for the country, he’s declared it as a direct transgression against Islam. According to the Egyptian Grand Mufti, as well as several other prominent Islamic leaders and their backers, Bitcoin is against the entire religion. This makes perfect sense once you listen to the reasoning behind this claim. Participating in the trading of cryptocurrencies is akin to gambling, which is strictly forbidden in Islam as it can directly cause the financial ruin of investors. Bitcoin, of all the cryptocurrencies, portrays this the best. It is extremely volatile, as is evidenced by the slide it experienced in December, and so it is certainly capable of causing a lot of financial ruin. People are saying that the preeminent coin is beginning to recover now (it is currently selling for $15,174.90, according to CoinMarketCap), but who is to say there won’t be another huge slide like the one witnessed at the end of 2017? A thing can only grow for so long. Egypt has declared Bitcoin a dangerous prospect and, frankly, this may not be the worst stance to get behind. Cryptocurrencies can be fun to play around with, much like gambling, but also like gambling, I think I’d prefer to watch from the sidelines. Featured Image: twitter",3-Jan,2018
" Just how many Bitcoin billionaires are there in the world? Nobody knows for sure, but recent speculations have the number pinpointed to somewhere between 35 and 200 – a far cry from the two everyone thought back in December. The Winklevoss twins were the first publicly verified Bitcoin billionaires, holding around 91,666 Bitcoin, which at the time would have equaled about $1.063 billion. The keyword there, however, is “public”. We knew about the twins; they weren’t keeping their wealth a secret. But not everyone wishes to be a public figure, for any number of reasons (which will be discussed below), so the likelihood that the twins were the only Bitcoin billionaires was pretty slim. Why is it so difficult to figure out how many people hold a certain amount of Bitcoin? Well, for one, the very nature of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is to provide an anonymous source of currency. There are some who are exceptions to the rule, such as the Winklevoss twins, but there are many more people who fall into the rule, keeping their identities secret. Bitcoin makes it very easy to remain anonymous as well. Those that are smart will keep their funds in a digital wallet. Those that are really smart (and those that hold large fortunes of Bitcoin) will keep their funds in multiple wallets. We may be able to see how much is in this or that wallet, but we have no way of knowing if this or that wallet is owned by the same person or group – especially if those wallets don’t link to one another in a traditional way. Why would someone want to keep their Bitcoin ownership a secret? For one thing, hackers. If a hacker knew exactly who they needed to target, I would imagine it would be easier to target them. Those that were publicly out as Bitcoin billionaires would also be among the few cryptocurrency investors who would be hit hard with taxes and regulations that government agencies aren’t able to throw at Bitcoin due to the complexity and anonymity of the cryptocurrency world. That alone is certainly enough for someone to want to keep their billionaire status secret. In all likelihood, most of the Bitcoin billionaires, however many there are, are probably made up groups of people. exchanges or hedge funds. There are probably fewer individual billionaires as the rose-tinted glasses would like to have us believe. But any way you slice it, the Winklevoss twins are definitely not the only ones out there.

" There’s no denying that 2017 was a great year for Bitcoin. It started the year going for under $1,000. It started making some waves in the summer when it hovered in the $4,000 range. Then, in the early part of December, it almost hit $20,000, a phenomenal record that blew practically everyone away. Bitcoin made a lot of strides in 2017. Beyond just its amazing growth, the cryptocurrency hit a lot of milestones that would make any cyber mamma proud. Its growth also came with a growing acceptance into the mainstream – if you hadn’t heard of Bitcoin before 2017, you probably heard about it in 2017 – and Bitcoin also began to get integrated into everyday business, with payment platforms, companies, and even some financial giants taking up the cryptocurrency. It opened the door not just for itself but also for other digital currencies, some, that are seeing immense growths now, like Ripple. Blockchain, although somewhat more relatable to the cryptocurrency Ethereum, also grew in relation to Bitcoin. In the beginning of December, the preeminent coin saw not just one, but two launches for future trading contracts on the largest futures exchanges in the world, CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (NASDAQ:CBOE), which opened up the trading of cryptocurrency to a broader scope of investors on Wall Street. So where is it headed to now? The latter half of December actually saw a slight burst in the bubble that had investors everywhere panicking. The cryptocurrency dropped from its whopping near-$20,000 point to below $13,000 in a matter of only a few days, and it has yet to show very many signs of recovery. Currently, it is trading at $14,021, according to coinmarketcap.com (see chart below).  Source – coinmarketcap.com Bitcoin has started the new year with a decline, something which hasn’t happened since 2015 – a tough blow for some after all the highs in 2017. The top cryptocurrency is also losing its dominance of the market. According to coinmarketcap.com, Bitcoin’s dominance is now below the 40% mark, at 35.8%. What does this mean for Bitcoin? Is it the end of the cryptocurrency? In all likelihood, no. Many analysts, including the one who predicted 2017 climb, believe that Bitcoin is going to bounce back. It may not continue to grow at the immense rate of 2017, but it also seems doubtful that 2018 is going to bring a complete downfall of Bitcoin either. The coin still holds the largest market cap of all the digital currencies, with more than a $100 billion gain over the second highest cryptocurrency market cap, Ripple. It may be a rollercoaster of a ride, but Bitcoin is still going to be making headlines this year. Featured Image: twitter",2-Jan,2018
" As we approach the end of the year, now is the time to reflect on all that happened in 2017 – and there was a lot. But, if you had to take a wild guess, what topic would you think was the most searched for on Google? President Donald Trump? North Korea and its nuclear program? Facebook and fake news? Or, would you guess that people spent a good amount of the year searching for news about digital currency Bitcoin? If you guessed the latter, you’re right. Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) just recently posted a series of data which details what the top searches in 2017 were. Bitcoin took second place in the “Global News” sector.  Since Bitcoin took the market by storm this year, it isn’t entirely surprising to hear that the currency made it on a list that looks at the top searches in 2017, but what is surprising is that news on the cryptocurrency surpassed news that covered events such as the 2017 Solar Eclipse as well as the horrendous Las Vegas massacre that took place across from the Mandalay Bay.  It’s almost comical that Bitcoin ranked number two, and was sought after on Google for the entire year, but then days leading up to 2018, the digital currency found itself in a slump.  What do I mean by a slump? Well, let’s just look at Bitcoin’s track record for the month of December. On December 10, the virtual currency hit an all-time high, moving past $19,800, but then found itself declining 12 days later to hit $10,400 on the popular U.S. Coinbase exchange. Since then, Bitcoin has struggled to stay above $11,000 but found itself sitting around $15,750 on December 27, and then back down to $14,000 on December 28.  Further, Google disclosed that “How to buy bitcoin” came in at third on its “How to…” search list.  It will be interesting to see if Bitcoin can keep its head above the water next year and if it will maintain its spot on Google’s top searches for 2018.  Featured Image: twitter",29-Dec,2017
" On December 26, just one day after Christmas, a leading analyst for the Bitcoin exchange Exmo, was kidnapped as he was leaving his office, located in Kiev’s Obolon district, which is an urban district in Ukraine.  It has now been reported that Pavel Lerner, 40, was returned by his abductors on Friday, but is suffering from stress, and will not provide any comment on what happened in the forthcoming days. The exchange was founded back in 2013 and has since grown to become a respected exchange in the cryptocurrency sector, obtaining a presence with a number of developers from Russia, Thailand, and Spain, and financial advisers from the United Kingdom.   The news shocked the cryptocurrency community, both local and international, as Lerner is a well-known Russian blockchain expert, and as many know now, blockchain technology is what supports the virtual currency Bitcoin.  Exmo announced Friday that Lerner is safe and was returned with “no physical harm inflicted on him.”  Apparently what happened was that Lerner was leaving his office on Boxing Day when a group of “unknown masked people” approached him and threw him into a black car.  It’s unclear as to where Lerner was kept, or the reasons behind his kidnapping, but Exmo did confirm that Lerner was “thrown out on a motorway” by his kidnappers on Friday.  With more than 94,955 active users trading currencies on the Exmo exchange, it’s unnerving that such a thing could happen to this company. According to a spokeswoman for the company, authorities are looking into the matter.  Also this week, Exmo disclosed that it had suffered a cyber attack on Thursday. We do not know if the two cases are connected.  Featured Image: twitter",29-Dec,2017
" Another day, another Bitcoin price drop. It never used to be like that, in fact, for a while, it was the opposite; but over the past couple weeks, it has become more and more obvious that the digital currency – and a number of other cryptocurrencies – is in a slump.  Here’s what’s been going on as of late:  On December 10, Bitcoin reached an all-time high, moving past the $19,800 mark. However, 12 short days later, the digital currency dropped to $10,400 on the Coinbase exchange, which, for those who don’t know, is an extremely popular U.S. cryptocurrency exchange.  It doesn’t stop there, however. For the days following the drop from the all-time high, Bitcoin has struggled to stay above the $11,000 mark but managed to climb yesterday so it could sit at around $15,750. That was until today, when Bitcoin continued its decline, dropping below the $14,000 mark.  So, what happened? Is it just because people are losing faith in the world of cryptocurrency? Maybe. I definitely have; in fact, I predict that Bitcoin will drop to $9,000 by February of 2018 – but this isn’t about what I think.  Thursday’s drop in price came after South Korea announced to the public that it is thinking about shutting down exchanges. To no surprise, most cryptocurrencies dropped on the news, with Bitcoin down as much as 10%.  Commenting on the drop, Robert Watson, who is the head of asset allocation at Mercer, said that he does believe Bitcoin to be just a speculative bubble and that it is inevitable that the digital currency will “more or less” collapse in the near-future. That being said, if you are still interested in cryptocurrencies, but you are pivoting away from Bitcoin, Ethereum (which is down more than 7%), and Litecoin (down more than 10%), you might want to think about trading your cards in for Ripple, which has been increasing for the past two days straight, trading over 26% yesterday and 3.86% Thursday.   Featured image: Twitter",28-Dec,2017
" Virtual currency Bitcoin and President Trump have made most of the headlines in 2017, both of which have either sparked outrage or extremely strong support.  While some people are die-hard Bitcoin fans, others believe it is just a speculative bubble. For a while, it seemed that the digital currency wasn’t going to slow down at all, hitting an all-time high on December 10, but all of that changed very quickly when the virtual currency plunged on December 22 and has not gone past its all-time high since.  On Wednesday trade, Bitcoin was sitting at around $15,000 but has been struggling to stay above the $11,000 mark for the past couple days. This might be why William Galvin, who is the secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, announced today that Bitcoin is “entirely speculation,” and that it does not pass the “smell test.”  To some investors surprise – not mine though – Galvin announced that there is no product when it comes to the preeminent cryptocurrency, and it is all just speculation. He added that Bitcoin is so volatile because no is able to explain it or control it.  This isn’t entirely shocking to hear that Galvin feels this way considering he said two weeks ago that Bitcoin is a “worthless product,” providing a number of reasons to back up his statement.  It’s not just Galvin who feels this way, however. A number of people have come forward calling the virtual currency the new Ponzi scheme, with others saying it is going to drop to $8,000 next year. On December 11, Jay Clayton, Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange, posted a statement which described the dangers of investing in virtual currencies.  What do you think? Are you going to continue to invest in cryptocurrencies next year? Featured Image: twitter",27-Dec,2017
" Taking into consideration the past couple weeks Bitcoin has endured, I’m not entirely surprised to hear that DataTrek Research co-founder Nick Colas forecasted on Wednesday that the digital currency will experience more price fluctuations in 2018 as well as four more market crashes.  Looking back on 2017, one cannot deny that the preeminent crypto coin took the market by storm. It seems to be that people either love it or they hate it; either people are going to put all of their eggs in the cryptocurrency basket or they are going to argue that it is just a speculative bubble. Based on the latest couple of weeks, I’m going to say that it is the latter.  After hitting an all-time high on December 10, soaring well above the $19,800 mark, the digital currency plunged on December 22 to a low of $10,400 on the Coinbase exchange, which is one of the most popular digital currency exchanges in the United States. On Wednesday, in morning trade, the price was sitting at around $15,750. Bitcoin is definitely in the midst of a slump, and it is starting to affect a number of organizations in the sector. In fact, just last week, after Bitcoin fell more than 5% in 24 hours, both Riot Blockchain Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) and Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCMKTS:GBTC) shares plunged almost 20%.  Mentioned briefly, on Wednesday, December 27, Nick Colas, who has been covering Bitcoin for the past four years, stated that Bitcoin is in for a “wild ride” next year. Even though the digital currency has increased almost 1,600% over the course of the past year, Colas wholeheartedly believes the coin is going to experience a tremendous amount of volatility in the forthcoming year.  Elaborating further, Colas stated that in 2018 Bitcoin could be trading within a range of $6,500 to $22,000.  Meanwhile, others have come forward and said that the cryptocurrency is just another Ponzi scheme, or another Dutch Tulip Bulb Market Bubble, while others believe Bitcoin could drop to $8,000 next year. Personally, I am forecasting that Bitcoin will drop to $9,000 by February of 2018.  What do you think? What are your predictions for Bitcoin next year?

" Bitcoin, along with many of the other cryptocurrencies, has witnessed a dramatic price drop Friday, with Bitcoin losing almost 50% at its lowest compared to the $20,000 high it had achieved at the beginning of the week. Currently, the coin’s price has readjusted to $14,860 since falling, so already it looks to be in a recovery phase – and this is what many analysts are focusing on and using to keep the calm among the crypto investors. Many analysts are encouraging investors, especially new-to-the-block investors, not to panic about the price drops and to hold onto their coins. A correction was bound to happen eventually; a thing can only go up so much before it needs to come back down a little, and these types of things happen all the time with market trading. This isn’t the first time the digital currency has dropped in market share (and it will no doubt be the last); at the end of the summer, the cryptocurrency saw a dip after increasing for many weeks. Many analysts, including Alan Silbert, who has long been versed in the crypto-sphere, believe that this is the correction that was expected, but that cryptocurrencies will recover. What could be causing the drop right now? It could have something to do with the launching of the Bitcoin futures contracts. Through those contracts, investors are able to short on Bitcoin, meaning they can bet against it essentially. On December 10, Cboe (NASDAQ:CBOE) launched its futures contracts, which was followed a week later on December 17 by CME (NASDAQ:CME) in its launching of its Bitcoin futures contracts. Both did exceptionally well, with the Cboe launch pushing Bitcoin 19% higher. Initially, the future contracts would cause Bitcoin price to increase, as an extremely high amount of people are trading or betting on it, but as that slowly begins to wear off, and people sit back to wait and see where their bets will land, Bitcoin’s price is going to be affected. That looks like what we’re seeing a bit of now. It could also be the time of year. ‘Tis the season, but maybe not for Bitcoin. Featured Image: twitter",22-Dec,2017
" Now that Bitcoin’s price has dropped to $15,463.20 when it was previously above $19,000 just 5 days ago, there have been a lot of speculations on why it’s currently dropping after gaining so much this past year and on where Bitcoin will go next. One of the main reasons behind the current Bitcoin drop, experts say, is because of the high transaction fees that Bitcoin is subject to at the moment. According to Erik Voorhees, the CEO of ShapeShift (private) – a company that offers global trading on a variety of digital assets through web and mobile platforms – the average Bitcoin transaction fee has increased to $40 per transaction over the past 12 months. That’s a rate that is even higher than most bank wires. Higher Bitcoin transactions fees could be a reason behind Bitcoin’s current price slump (the high fees could be deterring some people from wanting to trade as much in Bitcoin), but another reason that has been given to the slump, which has declined another 5% as of Thursday, is linked to Ethereum, along with other altcoin cryptocurrencies in general. Bitcoin used to have the dominant share of the cryptocurrency world, but that share has dropped before, and this week it dropped again. Bitcoin now holds slightly less than 44% of the crypto market, which is the lowest that it has seen since August. The main factor behind this is that Ethereum has upped its share in a gaining price rally, as have several other altcoins such as Ripple. Ethereum increased its market share to 13%, effectively helping to lower Bitcoin’s share, thus reducing Bitcoin’s worth. Despite the slump, many analysts are saying not to panic. A drop like this is normal after the extreme growth Bitcoin saw this year (the last month alone saw Bitcoin soar from $8,000 to $19,000). Also, the slump certainly hasn’t been dissuading investors from speculating on Bitcoin’s future price. Just recently, an unknown trader, or group of traders, put up a million-dollar bet declaring that Bitcoin will reach $50,000 by the end of 2018.

" The New York Stock Exchange has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow the NYSE to list two Bitcoin ETFs. ETFs are exchange-traded funds. The NYSE wants to list two ETFs that will use futures contracts to track the price of Bitcoin. If approved, traders would be able to bet on how the Bitcoin future contracts will perform. Adding an ETF to the trading of Bitcoin future contracts would add further legitimacy to them. The ETFs, which the NYSE filed with the SEC on Tuesday, December 19, is a follow up from when ProShares, the leading provider of ETFs, filed for them in September. At the time when ProShares filed them, the ETFs, ProShares Bitcoin ETF and ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF, were refused review by the SEC. The SEC claimed that the reason for this was because the underlying assets, in other words, the Bitcoin futures didn’t yet exist. The refiling of these particular ETFs has occurred now that Bitcoin futures contracts do exist and are currently being traded on the CME (NASDAQ:CME) and Cboe (NASDAQ:CBOE) exchanges. There has been no word from the SEC as of yet on the standing of the ETFs and whether or not they will be approved. The consensus among experts, however, is that they will be, or at least one of them will be. Both the CME and CBOE have been having success from their launches of the Bitcoin futures contracts, and the transition has been smooth so far. The likelihood that the NYSE will soon be able to list its ETFs is strong. If SEC does approve the ETFs, it could mark a huge moment for the cryptocurrency world, possibly being the thing to finally push Bitcoin into the mainstream financial world, making it accessible to more people. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $15, 572.60. Featured Image: twitter",21-Dec,2017
" Kevin O’Leary, Shark Tank investor and well-known businessman, offered warning and encouragement to Bitcoin investors on an interview on CNBC. Mr. O’Leary gave a stiff warning to those that don’t understand Bitcoin stating that investing in something you don’t fully understand could be potentially disastrous. However, he offered some confidence stating that the digital currency is definitely an asset, if not a usable currency. He said, “I’m quite sure that 99 percent of the people that own Bitcoin do not understand how it works. That always is a cocktail for disaster. You should never invest in something you don’t understand.” O’Leary was clear in expressing his view of Bitcoin not being a sufficient currency at this time for transactions. He pointed out a specific instance in which he was unable to seal a $200,000 transaction due to the other parties’ concern of the high volatility. However, the investor views the digital currency as one of the most successful assets in the world. In his conclusion, he compared Bitcoin more to gambling than an investment and advises investors to only put in how much they are able to afford to lose, saying, “I just think it is a wonderful entertainment, just like a slot machine is, or putting chips on a roulette wheel. Right now it is fun, exciting, entertaining. As long as you can afford to lose everything you put into it, go with it.” Featured Image: CNBC",18-Dec,2017
" One year ago, Aaron Shamo was arrested in Utah on multiples drug charges after being involved in a drug ring. At the time authorities seized almost $500,000 of Bitcoin. According to Time Magazine, Shamo was involved in black market synthetic opioid fentanyl sales. Since the seizing, the cryptocurrency has skyrocketed in price and is now worth over $8.5 million and the US Attorney’s Office for Utah wants to sell it off. The court papers cite the reason for the sale as being due to Bitcoin’s high volatility. Historically, the authority that investigates these cases are the ones to keep the funds from the seized assets. The defendant pled not guilty and his attorney is not contesting the sale of the Bitcoins that were seized. Earlier last week, Bulgaria had seized a substantial amount of Bitcoin from a criminal investigation. The country seized over 200,000 Bitcoins which equates to around one-fourth of the country’s national debt or around $4 billion dollars. It remains unclear what the country will do with the cryptocurrency but this might become a trend of central authorities. Featured Image: depositphotos/meepoohyaphoto",18-Dec,2017

When officers stormed his home they found $1.1 Million of cash inside. As many already know, Bitcoin is a digital currency and has gained monumental mainstream attention this year and is currently selling at $18,695.20 a coin. Although Bitcoin isn’t a physical form of a currency, it hasn’t stopped some from taking advantage of the misinformed, selling various counterfeit bitcoin “gold” coins to make a profit.

" The Alexander Vinnik case in Greece has just taken an interesting turn. As we reported back in November, the Russian cybercrime suspect was awaiting his fate as the U.S and Russia battled for his extradition. Vinnik was arrested back in July when the U.S requested that he be arrested as he was on vacation with his family. He is said to have laundered $4 billion USD worth of Bitcoin through BTC-e.  Vinnik had appealed his extradition to the U.S because his home country, Russia, held him on ridiculously lower charges of laundering 667,000 ruble which is around only $11,500 USD.  Greece’s Supreme Court has now upheld the US request and is supporting the extradition to the North California courts. Vinnik’s lawyer said in an official statement following the ruling stating, “The Supreme Court has in essence accepted that our client should be sent to the United States.” It is now up to the justice minister to decide his ultimate fate, as the two options present radically different legal punishments.   Featured Image: twitter",15-Dec,2017
" Tom Lee, who co-founded the Fundstrat market research company, has publicly stated that the price of Bitcoin will only continue to increase.

" Jordan Belfort, the guy that the ‘Wolf of Wall Street’ was based on, has recently voiced his opinion on Bitcoin and the Initial Coin Offerings.  In an interview this week with the Financial Times on CNN, Belfort discussed his thoughts on the world’s first digital currency and the issues he finds with it.  While, he believes there will be further implementation of the digital currency more mainstream he doesn’t see the value of it, due to its limited supply. Belfort talks about the “shorting” that is currently occurring with the Bitcoin futures and believes it will catapult the price and the demand. However, he doubts with the limited supply and due to the possibility of regulations from various places, the digital currency will fall sharply.   The major issue he has with cryptocurrency is the fundraising tactics of initial coin offerings, calling them a “gigantic scam” that will eventually blow up in investors faces. He made a statement pretty profound, as he was found guilty of fraud to stock-market manipulation but he adds that ICOs are, “far worse than anything I was ever doing.” He essentially doesn’t see anything wrong with digital currency or even the fundraising but says that the majority of people don’t have ill intentions but the small amount that do, will ruin it for everyone. He is alongside a lot of individuals comparing the Bitcoin rise to the “Tulip Bulb” crisis in Holland back in the 1960s, pointing out that once people started trading futures of the commodity, it came crashing down.  He does believe that people are able to make some money on this cryptocurrency frenzy but need to be able to “pull” out and not enter again. Ultimately, he believes due to human nature this entire thing will blow up in everyone’s face and gives a clear warning of this. He states that it won’t affect these billionaire investors but will be devastating to the ‘middle-class’ average joes that place their bets on the market.

" Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Prime Minister, published a video over the internet on Tuesday expressing his views on our current traditional banking systems. He believes that they will eventually become obsolete and that Bitcoin would replace them entirely. Netanyahu bases his entire claim based on blockchain technologies’ trustless nature and the growth the cryptocurrency has seen within the last year.  In the video, the Prime Minister states that banks will eventually become outdated and easily replaced, saying, “Is the fate of banks that they will eventually disappear? Yes. The answer is yes. Does it need to happen tomorrow? And do we need to do it through Bitcoin? That’s a question mark.” The head of the Israeli state also spoke on the roles of banks explaining that their primary reason for existence was to ensure transactions between two people are secure and valid. He also states that the banks control how money is spent and benefit from having that control, at the cost of the transacting parties. Blockchain technology allows users to communicate directly and secures and validates transactions more quickly, in comparison to the traditional banking infrastructure currently.

" Scott Cutler, eBay’s (NYSE:EBAY) senior vice president, recently announced that his company is seriously considering accepting the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, as a payment method. On the platform itself, there is an array of items that have to do with cryptocurrency from various apparel with bitcoin emblem’s placed on them, mining contracts, hardware wallets and even mining computers. The one major thing missing, is being able to purchase goods in the cryptocurrency.  According to Cutler, the company is not quite there “yet.” This move would be a massive step towards the adoption of the digital currency. However, Steam, an online game retailer, just announced they will no longer accept Bitcoin as a means of purchase on their platform due to time it takes between the customer’s purchase and the company actually receiving the funds.  The difference between Steam and eBay’s platforms is that eBay is a marketplace, and it wouldn’t matter to them which currency is used as long as they receive their fee per transaction. The acceptance of the payment model wouldn’t be that much of a hindrance for the company, as it was for Steam so it’s adoption seems promising.  Craigslist just started accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment on-the-low but didn’t announce its new features to the public. For now, the eBay collaboration is in the idea phase, but with the holiday’s knocking on the door it might happen sooner rather than later. Featured Image: twitter",13-Dec,2017
" Craig Wright, the self-proclaimed creator of Bitcoin, claims that 2018 will be the year of Bitcoin Cash. Wright tweeted that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) had everything to gain in 2018; it will have more security, and what it will be capable of achieving will be limitless. He said that 2018 will bring “secure threshold systems to make even web wallets secure.” There will also be an improvement in privacy by making transactions blind, and there will be improved mixers. Wright further said that the BCH team would be spreading the cryptocurrency around the world, getting more people using it and thus driving the price up. When asked if the 2018 roadmap was well planned, Wright tweeted back, “It is well planned. There are many things coming. We are interested in delivering cash to the world. Not a bank settlement system. So, it is all about whether you believe in PayPal 1.5 in BTC or global cash in BCH.” Wright is asking users to come up with merchant solutions to help with the progress of BCH and is expecting a higher user rate of the cryptocurrency with the many new services and businesses climbing on board. The mining pool ViaBTC will be launching a crypto-to-crypto exchange platform that will have a focus on BCH, and there will also be a Bitcoin Cash Visa debit card coming out. Only time will tell whether the new year will bring a new spring to Bitcoin Cash’s step. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© PromesaStudio",13-Dec,2017
" Co-owner of the Golden State Warriors and founder of the Social Capital, Chamath Palihapitiya, has just voiced his opinion of the potential growth of Bitcoin in an Interview with CNBC yesterday. The business head invested in the world’s first digital currency back in 2012 and believes the cryptocurrency will rise exponentially in the next twenty years as it more adopted mainstream. His price analysis isn’t far off from many other investors and tech leaders, who have predicted the price of Bitcoin to reach close to the $1 million level. In his interview Palihapitiya explains his predictions as such: “This thing has the potential to be comparable to the value of gold…This is a fantastic hedge and store of value against autocratic regimes and banking infrastructure that we know is corrosive to how the world needs to work properly…I think this thing is a $100,000 a coin in the next 3-4 years, and in the next 20 years will be $1 mln.” The founder’s main argument is that the digital currency offers a cover against the massive problems that could be potentially caused by the world’s current banking structure. If the banks were to fail, like the housing crisis back in 2008, Bitcoin is entirely disconnected from the platform and that’s the exact reason why the digital currency was created in the first place. He ended the interview with the advice to put at least one percent of what you invest into Bitcoin because he believes, it may “save us all.” Featured Image: Depositphotos/© yamabikay",13-Dec,2017
" Ron Paul, who is a former Republican Congressman and known gold standard supporter, has announced that he is shocked to hear that roughly half of his Twitter followers would choose to invest in bitcoin over gold.  According to CCN, Ron Paul designed a poll on his Twitter in which he asked his followers where they would invest a $10,000 gift that they could not touch for roughly 10 years. In the poll, Paul let his followers choose from Bitcoin, Gold, Federal Reserve Notes, or 10 year U.S. Treasury Bonds.  The results? More than half of respondents (70,513 users voted) said they would rather invest in bitcoin, while 36% said they would rather invest in gold.  In an interview with Kitco News, Ron Paul disclosed that he was “surprised” by the results that the poll showed. However, he felt a bit better that the majority of people would not entrust their $10,000 investment to a government-connected financial instrument.  Here’s what Paul had to say:  “Of course, bitcoin is very exciting, and it’s booming, but [bitcoin investors] don’t have a long-term perspective. What’s it going to be like in 10 years? Nobody knows. But we have a pretty good idea of where gold will be, in a general sense.” Keep in mind this poll was not scientific, and it was also posted on Twitter, which usually has a young demographic – just like digital currency investors.

" On Sunday, CBOE (NASDAQ:CBOE) started trading futures on Bitcoin, and on Monday, CBOE’S chief executive called out critics who have said that the exchange’s newly-launched bitcoin futures market was rushed.  Edward Tilly gave an interview to Financial News in which he said that the issues he has received about the futures market, such as those raised by the Futures Industry Association last week, were completely “uncalled for” and that in no way does it reflect the reality of the regulatory approval process.  Here’s what Tilly had to say, “I think letters like that and cheap shots to our regulator, the CFTC, are uncalled for to make it seem this was an overnight self-certification without the proper amount of CFTC involvement. This is just irresponsible. I respect all the concerns that the industry has but when it’s articulated in the way the FIA did, not so much.” For those who don’t know, FIA’s chief executive Walt Lukken said last week that a number of members were worried about the fluctuation surrounding the digital currency’s prices. He also attacked the process that led to CBOE’s futures market launch yesterday evening.  “I think letters like that and cheap shots to our regulator, the CFTC, are uncalled for to make it seem this was an overnight self-certification without the proper amount of CFTC involvement. This is just irresponsible. I respect all the concerns that the industry has but when it’s articulated in the way the FIA did, not so much,” Lukken said. It’s not just Lukken who raised objections either. In fact, a number of issues were raised by Thomas Peterffy who founded Interactive Brokers. Featured Image: twitter",11-Dec,2017
" There’s no doubt that the Bitcoin phase has blown up, but now it’s starting to really get out of hand. According to securities regulator Joseph Borg, people have started going as far as taking out mortgages in order to buy Bitcoin. And this, says Borg, is a huge mistake, “This is not something a guy who’s making $100,000 a year, who’s got a mortgage and two kids in college ought to be invested in.” Most recently, Bitcoin was trading at $16,700 on Coinbase. But it’s a volatile industry, its price constantly changing, up and down. There’s not going to be anywhere to hide if the bubble bursts, which some people believe could happen at any moment. That’s not a place you want to be in, especially not with a new mortgage on the line. The Bitcoin craze, increasing since the beginning of the year, might finally be getting out of hand if this is how far people are willing to go to get a piece of the action – and it’s probably going to go even further.

" Kay Van-Peterson, Saxo Bank’s global macro strategist, has recently stated that he anticipated Bitcoin to reach “$50,000 – $100,000 between the next six to eighteen months.” He spoke to Bloomberg recently and explained that the new influx of large institutional money will be the “catalyst” that pushes Bitcoin’s price higher.  Van-Peterson also believes the other cryptocurrencies could benefit and “do better” in regards to price growth from this. The strategist sees Ethereum being the next candidate for EFTs and the next ‘contender’ in the cryptocurrency arena.  He added, “The astonishing thing – mindblowing if you will – is that you take a step back and look at the price appreciation… a lot of this has happened without traditional institutional money, and that’s basically going to be coming on board over the next six to 18 months.” Bitcoin has had a monumental year, passing most financial analysts predictions for its short-term growth and many are now pondering what could be next for the digital currency. Even Van-Peterson’s prediction back in May of Bitcoin hitting $100,000 within the next ten years, is now less surprising as he has now altered his timeframe for the digital currency. Bitcoin’s price has recovered over the weekend as CBOE’s futures launched successfully, as it is currently selling around the $16,700 mark as it dropped below $13,000 during the weekend.

" Bitcoin has made its way into mainstream news within the last months and while it launched back in 2009, a new wave of adoption and understanding has catapulted its price in the year of 2017 over 2,000 percent.    Despite the new adoption and influx of investors, the core Bitcoin users remain to be a tight-knit small group. These early adopters, who happen to be a mix of technology devotees and bold entrepreneurs, hold a large majority of the sway of the cryptocurrency.  The holders of large amounts of bitcoin are called “whales” and according to bloomberg, only 1,000 people currently hold 40 percent of all the existing 16,734,762 circulating Bitcoin supply. So, how much control do these 1,000 people really have over the entire Bitcoin market? What happens if one day they decide to cash out, simultaneously or decide to join the futures route? The world’s largest cryptocurrency, recently saw a dip after a monstrous rally as it’s two biggest exchanges went offline after record-breaking traffic. Bitcoin hit around the $19,000 mark before crashing to nearly $14,000 in mere hours, over a 20 percent drop. The reason for this dip was due to fear and others cashing out for bigger profits.  This example of a minor market manipulation shows how just a few thousand coins can make the market move, should large groups decide to buy/sell. Also, this particular manipulation is not exactly coordinated and just all a part of the process but what is there was a coordinated move? Back on November 12th, an undisclosed individual moved almost 25,000 bitcoins, which was worth $159 million at the time, to a specific online exchange. The news broke throughout the community and many traders feared the owner selling that large amount at one time. It never occurred but many within the Bitcoin community feared the potential ramifications of selling of such a large amount of the cryptocurrency at once. Many fear the high volatility of Bitcoin, which is inevitably the only thing that is predictable with its market. There are many, though, that welcome the dip in the cryptocurrency and see it as an opportunity to buy up “discounted” Bitcoins. Thus emphasizing the issue, a coordinated sell-off between the whales could potentially cause a “flood” in the market and the move would manipulate it to a lower price. There have also been rumors of a trader with unlimited money who was personally manipulating the Bitcoin market. There has been no sign of a coordinated strike between these whales, yet. Who knows if they even understand the magnitude of their alliance or if they even know who each other are. Entering this week though, there are dangers lurking as the first round of Bitcoin futures have launched on CBOE. CME is set to the launch their futures contracts on Sunday and NASDAQ in their Q2 in 2018.  These futures allow different sets of Bitcoin investors to enter the market, which could completely make the current Bitcoin whales almost insignificant with the amount of money that could be potentially dumped in. However, with futures trading, there is a protection for a big price drop, and also a big opportunity to profit from either a drop or a rise. This means big incentives for investors to manipulate Bitcoin’s small market, with large amounts of money. Will these Whales also jump on these futures and manipulate its price to gain profit?  We shall see. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Christian",11-Dec,2017
" Tomorrow, a hard fork is set to initiate on the Bitcoin blockchain, thus creating Super Bitcoin which its developers claim will “Make Bitcoin great again.” Super Bitcoin, is part of a group of forks that are set to emerge from Bitcoin’s core chain in the month of December. Tomorrow’s fork comes from a Chinese group that is looking to optimize the blockchain with the Lightning network and plans on increasing its block size to 8-MB. The new chain is set for block 498,888, which will occur sometime on Monday, December 12. Developers on the project state their launch was due to the ideas in the Bitcoin community and have expressed on their website, “please remember: this is just an experiment.” The website reads, “We are merely implementing the proposals recommended by the Bitcoin community. Only when we put these talks into actions that we can make Bitcoin great again.” Super Bitcoin will supply 21,210,000 coins which will include 210,000 pre-mined coins.  According to current lists, f2ppol and BTCC will support the fork on their mining pools and 21 exchanges are set to trade the new currency. Featured Image: twitter",11-Dec,2017
" Bitcoin has now landed on Wall Street, with a bang.   Source: CoinMarketCap The CBOE Global Market Exchange Inc. launched its Bitcoin futures last night and the world’s largest cryptocurrency saw a 26 percent increase upon the debut. The initial volumes that came into the exchange exceeded expectation and CBOE’s website traffic was pushed to its limits causing major delays and brief outages. Unlike the outages that occurred last week on the Coinbase system, the CBOE outage didn’t cause Bitcoin’s price to fall.   Source: Bloomberg What are Bitcoin futures exactly? Futures trading has been around since the 19th century and it allows two parties to exchange an asset, at a specific price on an agreed upon date in the future. When this contract settles the buyer of the contract receives their payment in the product itself or in cash. These exchanges will halt for brief periods, if the price of the cryptocurrency spikes more than 30 percent, as you can see displayed on the chart above. CBOE and the upcoming CME futures, ill be settled in cash. This is appealing to mainstream investors because they can bet on the price of Bitcoin, without having to hold on the cryptocurrency what-so-ever.  CBOE’s Chief Strategy Officer Jon Deters, told Business Insider, “People will be able to settle in cash. So you can take a speculative position without touching bitcoin itself, which helps make it more attractive to all sorts of folks.” The arrivals of these futures is a huge milestone for the digital currency, as it was once only associated with drug dealing and other illegal activities, by investors.  These futures are anticipated to bring down the high volatility of the cryptocurrency as major institutions and high volumes of money, are involved. Still, the futures and their impact are still a big unknown – as the week progresses and CME launches their contracts next Sunday, we will know soon-enough. Featured Image: twitter",11-Dec,2017
" With little information on the fork, experts are calling Bitcoin Platinum a scam, created by a South Korean teenager. Despite Bitcoin Platinum’s official Twitter feed claiming there has been a group of miners, developers, investors, and users ready to hard fork the Bitcoin protocol at block 498,577, little further information has been provided. Bitcoin Platinum has had a vague description from the start. It claimed to use “Satoshi’s original vision of Bitcoin as decentralized electronic cash.” Subsequent tweets from the account have looked to be informal and poorly constructed, offering little information beyond “[Bitcoin] shorting very good.” It has been revealed since that the owner of the Bitcoin Platinum account is a South Korean teenager, who later admitted on Twitter that it was, indeed, a scam. No doubt due to this and other cryptocurrency scams, the South Korean government will begin to regulate the South Korean crypto market. Featured Image: twitter",11-Dec,2017
" On December 11, New York-based VanEck, an ETF fund provider, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to develop Bitcoin ETF products that are eligible to trade in cryptocurrency derivatives.  However, this is not the first ETF fund provider to do this. On December 8, Connecticut-based REX filed its own application.  According to the SEC public filing system, neither REX nor VanEck plans on holding onto bitcoins directly. Instead, both firms will trade futures contracts as well as other derivatives products in order to allow potential investors to profit from the fluctuations bitcoin tends to see in price.  While the SEC tends to deny, or just not bother to look at applications from ETF fund providers to develop Bitcoin ETFs, CBOE (NASDAQ:CBOE) just launched their bitcoin futures market on Sunday, and LedgerX just rolled out a number of other derivatives products.

" On Sunday evening, Bitcoin prices surged as soon as the Cboe Futures Exchange commenced trading futures on the digital currency. The Cboe exchange rolled out the futures under the stock ticker symbol ‘XBT’. As of 6 p.m. New York time, bitcoin was at $14,890 and then proceeded to jump to $15,500.13 as of 7:17 p.m. on the Coinbase exchange. In early trading on the Cboe, the new futures were at $15,860, which is up 2.6%. Even though things turned sour around 7 p.m. New York time, the digital currency quickly made a comeback. Here’s what JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, had to say about Sunday’s news: “So far, trading has been smooth. I think that was the biggest worry for people. We’ve been trading for about an hour and more than 700 contracts have been traded. So, I’d say this is a successful launch.” Up until this point bitcoin had been primarily owned and traded by entrepreneurs, but now, the launch allows for institutional investors to buy into the digital currency space.

" On Friday, a parcel bomber in Germany asked for a ransom of €10 million. And the bomber wanted it to be paid in the form of digital currency Bitcoin.  The bomber reportedly sent a message to a pharmacy located next to the Potsdam Christmas market in which he used the worldwide delivery company DHL to demand the €10 million ransom.  German Police are on the lookout for witnesses to the bomb threat, and already investigating it as both a bomb threat and an extortion case. According to the German police force, there is speculation that the package bomb was dropped at the local packing station in Potsdam. They are currently looking for suspects close to the Berlin area.  To no surprise, the entire police force throughout Germany is on high alert. They have asked the public to remain watchful as they continue their investigation into what really happened on Friday, December 8.  This is not the first time someone has asked for their ransom to be paid in the digital currency. In fact, it seems to be a popular route to take for blackmailers in Germany.

" According to the Winklevoss twins, the market value for bitcoin has the potential to exceed trillions of dollars in the forthcoming years.  Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss told CNBC that bitcoin properties allow the digital currency to act as a premier store of value in orders of magnitude. Cameron Winklevoss explained in the interview that:  “We’ve always felt that bitcoin, given its properties, is gold 2.0 — it disrupts gold. Gold is scarce, bitcoin is actually fixed. Bitcoin is way more portable and way more divisible.”  Additionally, Cameron noted that if the currency can continue to disturb the gold market, it is on the path to reach a trillion dollars in a very small time frame, seeing as the market value for the currency is already verging $300 billion.  Not only that, but the twins stated that other cryptocurrencies don’t stand a chance against the virtual currency and are not a competition in any way. “Bitcoin is not competing with those other currencies. It is competing with gold. Bitcoin is the oldest, it has the first mover advantage and there’s tremendous liquidity.”  For those who don’t know, this digital currency has transformed the financial industry around the world. If the market can maintain this growth over the course of the next few years, there is a good chance it will move into the gold industry. Featured Image: twitter  ",9-Dec,2017
" Andreas Antonopoulos, who has spent a great deal of his life informing the public about bitcoin, has been given more than $1.6 million by the bitcoin community.  Let me explain further:  For years, Andreas Antonopoulos has been present at conferences and events in the hopes of informing the world about bitcoin, a digital currency. And just last week, Antonopoulos revealed that while he might be an influential figure in the cryptocurrency sector, he is still dealing with debts in US dollars.  “My small savings that I do have are invested in bitcoin. 100 percent [of it]. I actually have a tiny debt in US dollars that I’m still trying to pay off so it is more than 100 percent in bitcoin. Now, I’d like to emphasize again, that is not a recommendation to invest. Because I haven’t invested by money in bitcoin, I invested my career, my intellectual capacity, my creativity energy, my passion, and my work in bitcoin. The money is the least of the investment that I have made in bitcoin and I could lose everything of it and I’d still have everything else,” he said.  Then, on December 5, investor Roger Ver stated that if Antonopoulos invested $300 five years, he would be a millionaire today. Antonopoulos simply responded:  “I did invest, Roger. Then I sold in 2013 to pay my rent. I didn’t have disposable income to work for two years without pay and invest at the same time. I should’ve gone into more debt, but that would have been irresponsible towards my family who I supported.” As a result of Ver’s statement, the bitcoin community asked bitcoin supports to show their loyalty and support to Andreas Antonopoulos, the man who helped get the virtual currency the recognition it deserves. Within 48 hours, the community raised over $1.6 million for the highly respected public figure. Featured Image: twitter  ",9-Dec,2017
" Alan Greenspan, the former US Federal Reserve chairman, recently was in the news for stating that Bitcoin can be easily compared to a very early form of money in the US called the “continental currency” that was started back in the mid-18th century during the American Revolution. This form of money was introduced to the US back in 1775 and eventually was deemed completely worthless by 1782. Greenspan spoke to CNBC recently and made claims that the Bitcoin, the world’s first digital currency, is irrational and feels it will have the same fate as the Continental currency did. During that time, the currency was not supported by any sort of commodity. Even though the currency has no apparent value, it was still used to create goods and services. The former chairman urges that this is the current state of Bitcoin. He said, “Bitcoin is really a fascinating example of how human beings create value and is not always rational … It is not a rational currency in that case.” The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value has gained thousands of dollars in value over the last few days. As per CoinMarketCap and at press-time, Bitcoin is selling at $15,919.30 up over 20 percent in just 48 hours.  The monumental trajectory of Bitcoin’s price this year has caused many senior financial officers to speak up, such as JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon who has called Bitcoin both a “fraud” and a bubble. Dimon also has said, “It’s worse than tulip bulbs. It won’t end well. Someone is going to get killed.” Featured Image: twitter",8-Dec,2017
" Back in May, Bulgarian’s law enforcement seized 200,000 bitcoins as they cracked down on organized crime in their country. Their government is now sitting on $3.5 billion USD, at today’s Bitcoin price. Back on May 19th of this year, a press release was sent out by the Southeast European Law Enforcement Center (SELEC) stating that a total of 213,519 Bitcoins were seized that month. The regional organization that seized these digital coins were composed of 12 states including Bulgaria. During the seizure, 23 Bulgarian nationals were detained and had been apart of an alleged customs fraud scam.  According to CoinMarketCap and at press-time, Bitcoin is selling at $17,551.10 per coin.  Per the press release, authorities stated, “The offenders choose the bitcoin way of investing/saving the money, because it is rather difficult to be tracked and followed.” The added that those that were involved hacked into Bulgarian customs with a virus, skipping paying the fees to import goods into the country. Government agents were bribed by the perpetrators and the virus was uploaded by them.   Overall, they dodged paying 10 million leva (Bulgaria’s currency) which is world nearly $6 million USD. At this time, what remains unknown is what the Bulgarian government is doing with the Bitcoins that were seized. According to Bivol.bg, the government declined to disclose further details on the subject due to the ongoing investigation.

" Valve will no longer be accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment on Steam. The company claims that the cryptocurrency has become “untenable” due to its extremely high transaction fees and the high level of instability in its value. Valve explained its decision, “In the past few months we’ve seen an increase in the volatility in the value of Bitcoin and a significant increase in the fees to process transactions on the Bitcoin network. For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled Bitcoin). These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of Bitcoin itself drops dramatically.” Bitcoin value goes through extreme fluctuations over the course of very little time, making transactions difficult and irritating. If a transaction is ongoing at the time of a change in Bitcoin’s value, the amount required to complete the purchase may reflect something different at the end of the transaction than what the user originally started with. With the recent surge of Bitcoin increasing $1000 in 24 hours, Valve has seen more and more customers getting stuck in this scenario. When this happens, Valve either refunds the overpaid amount, or the customer is required to pay additional funds. In either scenario, the customer is faced with an additional Bitcoin transaction fee from the original one connected with the purchase. “With the transaction fee being so high right now, it is not feasible to refund or ask the customer to transfer the missing balance (which itself runs the risk of underpayment again, depending on how much the value of Bitcoin changes while the Bitcoin network processes the additional transfer),” commented Valve. Valve has decided the hassle isn’t worth it anymore, and that it is affecting user experience, so Bitcoin payment will no longer be a part of its gaming experience. Valve has said that it may reintroduce Bitcoin as payment later on in the future, if the cryptocurrency ever stabilizes, but for now, Bitcoin is out. Featured Image: twitter",7-Dec,2017
" Wall Street banks are saying ‘no’ to the Bitcoin futures contracts, claiming that the finance system isn’t ready for continuing rising prices. Two Bitcoin futures will be launching in December: the Chicago-based exchange, Cboe Global Markets on the 10th, and CME Group on the 18th. Nasdaq won’t be far behind, already planning a launch for the beginning of 2018, while the Tokyo Financial Exchange has also reported that it will be launching its own Bitcoin derivatives futures product. These announcements have been met with criticism from the major brokers. The Futures Industry Association, which is made up of banks including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), claims that the implementation of Bitcoin futures contracts “did not allow for proper public transparency and input.” The fact that Cboe and the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) have agreed to function under a self-certified regime for their contracts has led to little satisfaction, due to that fact that a self-certification regime for “these novel products does not align with the potential risks that underlie their trading and should be reviewed.” The main issue for members of the Futures Industry Association is the reliability of prices underlying the Bitcoin futures contracts. Bitcoin price is constantly fluctuating, and while it has moved up quickly this past month, more than 50%, the qualms are that it would also be capable of falling just as quickly and drastically.

NiceHash has not confirmed the total amount of Bitcoin that was stolen, however, CoinDesk has reported that as much as 4,736.42 in Bitcoins were stolen, which at the time of the report was worth over $62 million. With the jump that Bitcoin price has recently taken, the total amount of Bitcoin stolen could be as much as $70 million now, if not more. There have been several fingers pointed at a particular Bitcoin wallet address that, when it opened on Tuesday at 9:07 pm, went from a balance of 0.01 Bitcoin to a balance of 4,655.25 Bitcoin in just ten minutes, with over 3,000 transactions made by the user – and the number has climbed since. Confirmation has been made by RT America after looking into the suspicious activity reported by the users claiming to have been hacked, and it looks like their money was indeed transferred to the mysterious Bitcoin wallet address. NiceHash has commented that they have begun an investigation into the matter, and that “relevant authorities and law enforcement” have been notified. They are “co-operating with them as a matter of urgency.” NiceHash head of marketing Andrej P. Škraba has said that the hack was “a highly professional attack with sophisticated social engineering.” Despite this, the company assures its users that it is “fully committed to restoring the NiceHash service with the highest security measures at the earliest opportunity.” However, how the company will be able to rectify matters if total compensation is unable to be achieved remains up in the air. In the meantime, NiceHash is encouraging users to change their passwords, both on their NiceHash accounts as well as on other services. Featured Image: twitter",7-Dec,2017

" Bitcoin has now reached the $13,000 mark early this morning, and many analysts are still looking into why the digital token continues to break its own records. The results may have nothing to do with the cryptocurrency itself but more so about the latest nominee at the Federal Reserve (The Fed). Marvin Goodfriend, has been called the ‘worst Fed nominee in History’ and a visionary by various news sources. However,  Still, the newest addition to the Fed may be contributing greatly to the rise of Bitcoin. Goodfriend’s anti-cash views are the first of its kind, from a person in his position.  The new representative had voiced his opinions that paper money puts financial freedom in the hands of the people, a plot that he does not like if a crisis were to occur. During such crisis, the Fed usually lowers interest rates for individuals, in order to increase the borrowing power for consumers and small businesses. The issue is that if the Fed were to lower interest rates to something close to zero on checking and savings accounts, people now have the power to simply withdraw physical money from their accounts to stop the potential of them losing money. Goodfriend, does not like this freedom to protect the value of money and believes that cash is the limiting factor that holds back the power of the Fed from controlling the economy.  This rigid monetary stance might be the cause of the recent spike in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Should such stiff government policies come into existence, digital currencies might present a better method for trading and interact with currency that would be completely out of the Federal Reserve’s control. This is the exact reason why Bitcoin was created in the first place, back in 2008.  Obviously, there have been other factors in the rise of Bitcoin but Goodfriend’s remarks and opinions may have boosted its price unintentionally.  Featured Image: Depositphotos/© tanarch",6-Dec,2017
"   The UK native superstar, Lilly Allen has been topping the charts since back in 2006 and hasn’t let off the steam since. Although she has become somewhat of a singing legend, she still has her regrets just like you and me. It turns out that the 32-year-old once turned down a performance where she was offered hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin, for her to sing. She tweeted back in 2014, calling herself an “idiot” for turning down the gig back in 2009. If you’ve seen any of the headlines, Bitcoin has grown to phenomenal amounts this year and is now selling at £9,810.10 ($13,127 USD), per coin. If she would have accepted the gig and held onto the cryptocurrency, her digital wallet would be worth over £1.68 billion.

" As Bitcoin gains popularity all over the world, more individuals are now starting to sell their more lucrative items in exchange for the digital currency.  The rental housing market and now even airlines have begun accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment method. It seems now that this is being applied to collector‘s items, such as luxury automobiles. A car owner in the U.K has now listed his Gold Ghost Rolls-Royce for sale on the major website Autotrader but is only selling it in Bitcoin and not in pounds. If you were to buy a brand new Rolls-Royce from the dealership it would cost you over £230,000 but with only 35,000 kilometers, this 2010 would only cost you £117,000 in Bitcoin. The owner told the Daily Mail, “Why not trade in Bitcoin? I treat it in exactly the same way as normal currency these days. It’s safe, convenient and incredibly valuable right now so, to me, it makes sense to trade my car this way. It’s the future.” This Ghost model will also come with a personalized number plate, for an additional fee. It comes with a 6.6-liter engine and the Gold car has all the luxurious specs to match its price tag. At the beginning of 2017, if you would have invested just £12,000 and kept it, you would now be able to purchase this beautiful Rolls-Royce. As Bitcoin futures are just around the corner, the demand for the cryptocurrency is almost certain to grow. Whether or not people decide to invest long or short term in the digital currency, once the futures hit the market in full force a flood of new investors are anticipated to flood the market.  As the demand continues to grow, everyday transactions with the digital currency will become more of the norm. Featured Image: autotrader",6-Dec,2017
" Back in 2009, James Howell entered the cryptocurrency space and was able to accumulate 7,500 Bitcoin. Eventually, his girlfriend made him give it up, as the blockchain mining hardware was far too noisy for her liking. At the time, it wasn’t a huge loss. The British IT worker ended up selling most of the mining equipment for scraps after he accidentally spilled lemonade all over them. Howell did, however, keep the hard drive with the keys to his digital wallet for a few years before eventually throwing it in the trash, yikes.  Currently, one bitcoin is now trading for just under $13,000 USD which would’ve made him up a ‘mere’ $96 million. Now, the money just sits in a random landfill somewhere. Howell joked about digging it up back in 2013 to the Guardian but is now making plans to dig it up.  “A modern landfill is a complex engineering project and digging one up brings up all sorts of environmental issues such as dangerous gasses and potential landfill fires. It’s a big, expensive and risky project.” Howell is not certain which trash mound holds his long-lost fortune and who knows, it may not even be salvageable if he does find it but he intends on trying.

" Max Levchin, co-founder of the worldwide online payment system PayPal, announced his views on Blockchain technology Sunday in Silicon Valley as ‘revolutionary’ but is still unsure about Bitcoin.  The famously successful entrepreneur remains open to it but is still unsure about the long-term stability of cryptocurrency. Based off this interview, Levchin clearly expressed the power that blockchain technology holds and how far it will reach but he doesn’t see a certainty with Bitcoin. Levchin said, “I invest in things that I have a strong, long-term point of view on and Bitcoin I’m still trying to figure out.” Many others have been in the new praising the underlying blockchain technology but knocking the cryptocurrency that runs on the blockchain. Huge financial leaders such as the president of Mastercard have implied of the bright future of the technology of the blockchain but don’t necessarily include Bitcoin in the mix. Levchin also added, “I think a form of a Blockchain technology, Bitcoin or otherwise will be essential and will not go away. Not only that, it will continue advancing and being used in many different industries from financial technology to medicine. But it’s not clear to me whether Bitcoin itself is the great long-term investment.” Despite the negative comments against the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin continues to break all-time high records and is now selling over $11,800.

" If you’re an owner of Bitcoin and get into traffic issues in South Africa, fear not, because the country now lets you pay your traffic fines with Bitcoin. The South African traffic fines administrator, Fines4U, allows clients to pay any outstanding fines in Bitcoin. However, there will be no POS system or direct QR payments; rather, this is an example of a business looking to accumulate Bitcoin without risking the direct investment in it. Fines4U is the intermediary between companies and individuals who need to pay the fine and the government agency charging the fine. Fines4U gets the money from one to the other, managing traffic fines for about 500 companies and 8,000 individuals. Cornelia van Niekerk, the founder of Fines4U, has personally invested in Bitcoin, so her new plan is to accept Bitcoin payments from clients and have the Bitcoin be deposited into her own personal wallet. Then, she will pay the fines through the business using local currency, and deposit money back into her business from her own finances. In this way, she gets the Bitcoin directly from the clients, and her business keeps its income through her personal finances. For clients wishing to take advantage of this offer, the outstanding amount of their traffic fines will be calculated, and then they will be presented with the amount in Bitcoin, which will be valid for a limited period.

" Bitcoin has been going back and forth between the praisers who claim that Bitcoin will only continue to rise and doubters who believe the market’s going to crash. It’s hard to tell who is going to be right, but if it is the doubters, there are a lot of people who are going to lose a lot – unless of course, something was to warn them of any impending crash. That’s the intention of the Bitcoin Bubble Burst app. The app was developed to scan Bitcoin markets, news, and social media platforms and to signal the user if any of these platforms indicate a potential market crash in the future. The app provides real-time price change alerts to users by using algorithms based on Bitcoin price change data. Could this really be the saving grace investors are looking for? Maybe, but it’d be best to view it with a grain of salt and investors may not want to use it as their main decision maker in regards to Bitcoin and its future. Any number of things could go wrong with the scanning or reporting system, and a large number of bad news reports could trigger sell-off messages on the app, and others like it, which could actually cause the very situation they are trying to predict. However, developers are optimistic: “Utilizing sentiment analytics we can get a numeric picture of the current event. Our model learns which patterns are ‘odd’ and when to contact you via notification.” If nothing else, the app and its counterparts will be useful in monitoring real-time data from a broad domain of exchanges and the worldwide trade of Bitcoin, and it will be good to have a regulated system for monitoring the very quick value changes of Bitcoin.

" Surf Air will be accepting both Bitcoin and Ethereum payments for its monthly membership and charter services. Users of the airline can pay for their seats with either cryptocurrency through a mobile app, and their monthly membership program, which allows members to fly as many times as they want, will also be accepting crypto payments for its monthly fee. Coinbase will be handling all the payments for the company. CEO Sudhin Shahani said that the move to accept Bitcoin and Ethereum is a part of their wider efforts to disrupt air services. “Digital currency has been on our radar from the very beginning and we are excited to provide our members with another quick and seamless way to do business with Surf Air,” he said. There are many other small airlines that are doing as Surf Air has done, some taking it even further by looking into the applications of blockchain and how they may be beneficial to ticket disbursement and maintenance tracking.

" This past month major Bitcoin future contracts have been approved on two large exchanges and as a result, Bitcoin’s price has reached all-time records. According to a few cryptocurrency analysts, this addition may produce a platform for a large pending ‘short’ market. As Bitcoin has high volatility and the potential to fall, it could lead to a massive number of certain investors taking those ‘short’ positions.  In a recent article published by Bloomberg, hedge funds may force some massive pressure and begin to take advantage of what they see as potentially the “greatest shorting opportunity in history.” Lou Kern, a Flight VC partner and long-time cryptocurrency investor stated:  According to cryptocurrency investor Lou Kerner, a partner at Flight VC: “[It may be] one of the greatest shorting opportunities ever. You have a lot of zealotry, and a lot of people, including me, who think it’s the greatest thing to ever happen in the history of mankind. You have a lot of people who think it’s a bubble and a Ponzi scheme. It turns out both of them can’t be right.” The addition of Bitcoin futures into the market will have major impacts into bringing mainstream investment money into the cryptocurrency space, where it’s long or short. Regardless of the price, Bitcoin’s overall ecosystem should begin to stabilize considerably with the influx of investors. If a large amount of money were to move into the short position and Bitcoin’s price was to rise, the results could become the largest ‘short squeeze’ of all-time. So what’s a ‘short squeeze’, you ask? This squeeze takes place when a densely shorted stock rises in price, which then forces short contract holders to “squeeze” out of their short positions at a loss and thus driving the price father up with heightened pressure.

" Bitfinex is the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, with a $657 million daily trading volume, but recently there have been some false allegations floating around the crypto world against Bitfinex – and they are finally taking action against the firestarters. The exchange intends to sue. The exchange’s in-house counsel Stuart Hoegner has said that there were some “bad actors” spreading “false information” to “agitate the cryptocurrency ecosystem.” “To date, every claim made by these bad actors has been patently false and made simply to agitate the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As a result,  has decided to assert all of its legal rights and remedies against this agitator and his associates,” said Hoegner. The identities of these false information spreaders have been withheld, but Bitfinex public relations executive Ronn Torossian has said of the matter, “I think you can infer who.” Torossian further commented, “In recent months, certain parties and their associates have made false and unsubstantiated claims against Bitfinex, engaging in potential market manipulation activity that is dishonest and unlawful.” The inference we are meant to make, it would seem, is Bitfinex’ed, as they released a statement claiming that the lawsuit against Bitfinex will be defended. “I am officially seeking donations to defend myself against Bitfinex’s frivolous lawsuit, rather than showing their numbers they seek to silence me,” wrote Bitfinex’ed.

" Bitcoin can’t occur without Bitcoin mining, and mining can’t occur without electricity – 31 terawatt-hours worth of electricity. With Bitcoin surging to $11,000, the demand on the power supply caused by mining has also surged. It has been estimated that Bitcoin and Bitcoin Gold, combined, has had 31 terawatt-hours climb in annual electricity consumption. In November, with Bitcoin’s climb towards record-breaking numbers, Bitcoin mining power consumption increased by almost 30%.

" Miners who once thought Bitcoin hydro mining and mining via phone was new and exciting have now just been proved wrong, the owner of a Tesla S is now mining Bitcoin’s from his vehicle’s free supercharger. How achieved this, was installing a Bitcoin mining computer in the trunk of his car and is charged by the car’s battery while it mines the cryptocurrency. This is a new and innovative way to mine Bitcoin that has never been done before and what makes it so lucrative is that the there is no cost to mine the cryptocurrency, as energy bills have said to be pretty expensive. The only cost associated with this process would be the car itself and the equipment to do the mining. New creative methods of mining will continue to arise as the world’s largest cryptocurrency, continues to increase in its price. While the use of the superchargers in the electric vehicles could be an awesome workaround to paying the high electricity bills associated with mining, owners could face potential issues with their cars.  Among one of the biggest concerns would be that the mining computers produce an abundant amount of heat and that could potentially damage the car’s internal parts over an extended period of time. Also, the car’s battery remains untested and could become damaged when it’s used continuously for a period of time, during the mining process. Despite the good amount of profit that could be made with the mining, Tesla owners should weigh the potential effects it may have on the performance of their not-so-cheap cars. Those wanting to save some money mining the digital currencies are encouraged to explore alternative methods such as renewable energies and they could use solar panels instead.

" Bitcoin’s price just surpassed the $11,700 mark, and yet, billionaire Ken Griffin has decided to join the conversation that compares the digital currency’s price increase to the Dutch Tulip Bulb Market Bubble, which ended in 1637.  In an interview with CNBC, Ken Griffin declared that bitcoin is as popular as it is in our modern world because society is confusing it with blockchain technology, which, according to Griffin, serves more purpose and has merit.  Based on Griffin’s take on the matter, blockchain technology is likely to have overpowering social implications in the forthcoming years. Additionally, Griffin stated that blockchain technology takes away the need for third parties as it creates safe, fast, and permanent transaction records.  The problem, to Griffin, is that people don’t know the difference between blockchain technology and bitcoin, which is causing individuals to purchase the digital currency without a clue as to what they are actually buying.  Unlike other financial experts, Griffin does not believe bitcoin is a fraud, but he does appearing to be sticking to the fact that bitcoin is a bubble that will inevitably hurt society. This, of course, is not the first team bitcoin has been referred to as a ‘bubble’.  For those who don’t know, Ken Griffin founded the Citadel hedge fund management firm, which now holds over $27B in assets. Currently, according to Forbes, Griffin’s net worth sits at around $8.6B.

For those who don’t know, McAfee is the latest addition to the MGT Capital Investments team, and he joined as chief cybersecurity visionary right as the MGT Capital made their transition into the world of the blockchain.  The former Libertarian presidential candidate tweeted the following about the currency:  “When I predicted Bitcoin at $500,000 by the end of 2020, it used a model that predicted $5,000 at the end of 2017. BTC has accelerated much faster than my model assumptions. I now predict Bitcoin at $1 million by the end of 2020. I will still eat my dick if wrong.” While it is quite the statement, one cannot help but wonder if he is correct in his prediction. Meanwhile, others are wondering if McAfee should have even increased his bitcoin price target in the first place, considering others have claimed the currency is just a bubble. Over the course of the past few months, McAfee has become much more vocal about the digital currency, even stating that he forecasts BTC and BCH fighting for the “Bitcoin” name.

As one might have guessed, Sunday’s recovery proves just how volatile bitcoin can be. Don’t believe me? Check out the currencies stats from this week: on Tuesday, bitcoin crossed the $10,000 figure, and on Wednesday, the digital currency surpassed $11,000, only to drop $1,000 in a matter of hours. It seems most people have their own opinion on the cryptocurrency but no one really knows the direction it is heading in. On November 27, former Fortress hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz said the currency could hit $40,000 at the end of next year, only to change his mind on Tuesday and say that bitcoin is “going to be the biggest bubble of our lifetimes.” Regardless of where Bitcoin is heading in the future, today’s new high gives investors worldwide a reason to celebrate.  Featured Image: depositphotos/Syda_Productions",3-Dec,2017
" Currently, the United States Senate Judiciary Committee is dealing with working out the kinks of the proposed bill S.1241. The aim of the bill? To criminalize the deliberate suppression of control or ownership of a financial account.  Additionally, bill S.1241 will modify the definition of both ‘financial institution’ and ‘financial account’ to include cryptocurrencies and their exchanges. According to Senator Dianne Feinstein, bill S.1241 is essential in order to update existing AML laws.  As mentioned, the proposed bill will alter the definition of ‘financial institution.’ The definition will be changed in Section 53412(a) of title 31 to include:  “An issuer, redeemer, or cashier of prepaid access devices, digital currency, or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency.” If things go as planned and bill S.1241 is passed, it will likely have effects for anyone using cryptocurrencies in the United States and out of the country.  There are a number of industry experts who have raised their opinions on bill S.1241. In fact, Tone Vays has said that he forecasts there to be a faceoff between the holders and users of Bitcoin and the United States government.  “It’s bad…I think it’s gonna end in a very confrontational way between Bitcoin—even Bitcoin holders and users—and the US Government.” Further, there have been a couple reports that have surfaced which suggest that the White House is monitoring digital currencies. While some might not be too worried about those reports, others believe this is yet another attempt at maintaining control over the decentralized system.

" Think you’ve got problems? Well, here’s another one: the White House is keeping a close eye on digital currencies – and that includes bitcoin. Do you know why this is a problem? It’s because this means the White House is trying to find a way to control the decentralized monetary system. On Thursday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, White House Press Secretary, announced during a press conference that bitcoin is “something that is being monitored by our team.” Her statement comes after a Buzzfeed reporter asked her whether or not Trump believes the currency should have more regulatory attention from the government.  Sanders added, “In terms of specific briefings and announcements on it, I don’t have anything that I can share with you right now.”  She also said Homeland Security has talked to President Trump about the matter recently. “Tom Bossert, with the Homeland Security team, an advisor to the president, has brought this up in a meeting earlier this week,” Sanders said.”I know this is something he is keeping an eye on.” When asked about Sanders’ press conference, billionaire hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz told Fox Business that “Ms. Sanders probably had prepared for the question and I’m sure Homeland Security is looking at it, the Treasury has looked at it, the Fed has looked at it.” While Trump has never actually talked about bitcoin publicly, we do know that he has a few pro-bitcoin contacts in his black book.

" On Thursday, Dr. Joseph Stiglitz said cryptocurrencies – more specifically bitcoin – should be banned. The following day, Robert J. Shiller opened up on the subject of the digital currency. And it’s not pretty.  Shiller believes that bitcoin will inevitably crash, and when it does, it will bear a resemblance to what happened to the stock market after the Great Depression. Additionally, the economist likened the appeal of the currency to a “mystery movie.” What does that mean? Well, because it has a certain appeal to it; it attracts anyone hoping to pull a fast one on the system.  For those who don’t know, Shiller was the recipient of the Nobel Prize in 2013. Plus, he predicted the housing bubble and the dot-com, so it’s no wonder people listen to him.  During a conference in Lithuania this week Shiller stated:  “Bitcoin, it’s just absolutely exciting ( …) You’re fast. You’re smart. You’ve figured out nobody else understands. You’re with it. And bitcoin has this anti-government, anti-regulation feel. It’s such a wonderful story. If it were only true.” He also noted that he doesn’t know if, when, or where bitcoin is going to end.  With that being said, despite having spot-on predictions in the past, Shiller might be wrong about bitcoin as there doesn’t seem, thus far, to be any sort of data that supports a crash. I mean, it wasn’t that long ago that Bitcoin surpassed the $11,400 mark, right? Featured Image: twitter",2-Dec,2017
" The much-awaited news was confirmed this Friday morning, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commision has finally approved Bitcoin futures trades on three different exchanges. In a statement released by the CFTC this morning, they announced the CBOE Futures Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange self-certified their new contracts for Bitcoin futures. Also, the Canto exchange has self-certified a contract for Bitcoin binary options. To clarify what the means, the ‘futures’ make it available to bet on Bitcoin’s price without having to buy the digital currency. Both exchanges have confirmed that their futures will settle in cash. Bitcoin has grown over 1,300 percent this year, due to growing interest from a wealthy manager and big retail traders. If these futures run smoothly, it could open the door for wider adoption among Wall Street.  The decision made by the CFTC this morning also came with a warning, they cautioned others due to the market being highly unsupervised. CFTC’s Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo said in the statement,  “Bitcoin, a virtual currency, is a commodity unlike any the Commission has dealt with in the past.”  Since the announcement, CME rose 1.7 percent and reached an all-time high this Friday morning. However, CBOE’s stock trades have changed very little today. From it’s original launch date of December 11th, CME has announced today from their website that they will begin on Monday, December 18. CBOE has yet to announce a specific date but a spokesperson from the exchange told CNBC that it will “probably” happen before the end of the year. The person states, “We are operationally ready and we will be announcing a launch date shortly.” There has been various reports lately that Nasdaq has plans of launching their own Bitcoin futures around June of 2018. A spokesperson from the exchange told CNBC that it would “base its price off of 50 Bitcoin sources from around the world.” CME is only using four sources and CBOE is only using one source, for their futures. If December 18th goes well, it could become a rat race for larger exchanges to adopt these futures.  Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Victor_DVA",1-Dec,2017
" Bitcoin broke $10,000 this week, in what seems like a skyrocketed advance from its $1,000 milestone at the beginning of the year. So what caused Bitcoin to jump that much? How did Bitcoin reach $10,000? One of the reasons, experts say, is due to institutional money. Investments from anywhere from hedge funds to pension funds to corporate businesses have been pouring into the cryptocurrency market and the fact that Bitcoin is now being supported by so much institutional money is a big reason for its advancement. Accounting firms and banks from around the world are supporting Bitcoin now when they weren’t before and this marks a major shift. Bitcoin is being adopted into the mainstream. Both those who have done research on the market, as well as investors unfamiliar with cryptocurrency, are putting money into Bitcoin right now. There are new streams of people getting involved with Bitcoin every day, and the more people supporting it, the more news about Bitcoin is generated, the more Bitcoin grows. Even at these levels though, only an estimated half-percent of the global population uses digital currency, meaning that there is still more room for Bitcoin to grow if it can keep its market going. Sol Lederer, Blockchain Director at LOOMIA has said of the growing cryptocurrency, “Bitcoin’s future is still uncertain; it faces the same serious technical challenges it has for years and faces stiff competition from newer, more sophisticated Blockchains. But even if it were to crash, it’s apparent that Bitcoin is here to stay. Whether it trades at $10,000, $5,000, or $500, it’s not going away.” Featured Image: twitter",1-Dec,2017

As you can see from the chart above, Bitcoin hit a record high of $11,488.60 at 14:09:10 UTC and dropped to a staggering $9,669 at 19:54:13, down a staggering -16 percent in just a matter of hours. There were various reports of exchange issues when buyers/traders flooded the systems when both BTC and Ethereum, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency, hit their record highs almost simultaneously. Coinbase, the largest online exchange had to undergo various updates as their system crashed and users were completely locked out of their account. The next day, however, they underwent full system upgrades to accommodate more users being on their site and are now full systems go. Another exchange, Gemini, claimed they were “undergoing maintenance” mid-day Wednesday and completely shut down their website but got their exchange up and running that night. Bitcoin is no stranger to high volatility, it has dipped over 20 percent in its value already on three different occasions this year. With the news breaking of the upcoming BTC futures to be traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, you can expect definite price fluctuations leading up to this release.

" Nobel Prize Winner Joseph Stiglitz declared on Bloomberg TV that cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, should be prohibited. The reason? Because Stiglitz believes the market for Bitcoin is driven primarily by its potential to get around certain government organizations.  In Stiglitz’s statement – which appeared to be more of a rant – he added that the Bitcoin market will fluctuate for a while, and then eventually hit a wall, leaving hundreds of investors injured. For these reasons, Stiglitz believes cryptocurrencies should be banned. He also added that Bitcoin does not have a “socially useful function.”  It’s not just cryptocurrency that Dr. Stiglitz is reportedly looking to take down. He might also want to ban the FANG stocks, which stands for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).  Some might be shocked by that, while others might have wanted the same ban to occur. If consumer protection is your goal, then FANG stocks are extremely risky and could be worthy of a ban.  Dr. Stiglitz might be onto something, but until the nature of Bitcoin changes, the digital currency might be near impossible to ban. It seems governments are just going to have to deal with the cryptocurrency.  Featured Image: twitter",30-Nov,2017
" One of the world’s largest accounting firms, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), has accepted its first ever bitcoin payment. PwC accepted bitcoin as payment for its advisory services, as it is currently working with multiple startups that deal in bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry. PwC has also started to advise clients about various cryptocurrency related options, such as funds and investments, exchanges, and ICOs. “This decision helps illustrate how we are embracing new technology and incorporating innovative business models across our full range of services,” said PwC Asia-Pacific chairman Raymund Chao. “It is also an indication that bitcoin and other established cryptocurrencies have now developed into more broadly accepted forms of settlement.” PwC is not the first accounting firm to accept bitcoin as payment for its services. Ernst & Young (EY) in Switzerland accepted bitcoin for its auditing and advisory services at the beginning of 2017. EY also set up a Bitcoin ATM among its offices, providing its employees with a digital bitcoin wallet within its in-house EY wallet app. Accepting bitcoin as payment was essential for EY’s strategy of “digitizing itself.” Featured Image: twitter",30-Nov,2017
" Turkey has reportedly declared Bitcoin not “compatible” with Islam because the government is unable to have control over it.  Based on a statement from a meeting of the state Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet), lawmakers strongly believe Bitcoin has a “speculative” nature which makes purchasing and selling it an ‘inappropriate’ act for Muslims.  Here’s the translated statement:  “Buying and selling virtual currencies is not compatible with religion at this time because of the fact that their valuation is open to speculation. They can be easily used in illegal activities like money laundering, and they are not under the state’s audit and surveillance.” For those who don’t know, Diyanet put the guidance into action on November 24, which means it was only a couple days before Bitcoin’s latest bull run.  After Turkey’s banning of PayPal, the transcontinental country has since been a target of Bitcoin startups, however, conditions over there have continued to be unstable.  In the statement, Diyanet noted that the “unsuitability” principles also apply to Ethereum.  Featured Image: Depositphotos/© yamabikay",30-Nov,2017
" CEO of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Lloyd Blankfein, claims that bitcoin is a “vehicle to perpetrate fraud” and has been outward about his distrust of the cryptocurrency. “Something that moves up and down 20 percent in a day doesn’t feel like a currency, doesn’t feel like a store of value,” said Blankfein. Bitcoin hit its all-time high on Wednesday, reaching $11,441, but skeptics like Blankfein aren’t jumping to get in on the action, perhaps for good reason. Since this record-breaking level, bitcoin has been struggling to maintain the $10,000 threshold it had been working itself towards all week, most recently trading at $9,577 — almost $2,000 off its recently achieved high. Blankfein has no plans to start pursuing bitcoin, personally or professionally. “If it works out — and it gets more established, and it trades more like a store of value, and it doesn’t move up and down 20 percent, and there is liquidity to it — we’ll get to it.” But Blankfein doesn’t see that happening anytime soon. “When do I have to have a bitcoin strategy? Not today,” Blankfein stating, showing his lack of interest in the cryptocurrency. “Bitcoin is not for me. A lot of things that have not been for me in the past 20 years have worked out, but I am not guessing that this will work out,” he concluded. Featured Image: twitter",30-Nov,2017
" The Bitcoin Gold wallet repository and download files weres hacked last week, putting users at risk of having funds and personal data stolen. A “Critical Warning” was posted by the Bitcoin Gold’s development team on November 26, stating that anyone who downloaded the official Windows wallet from the Bitcoin Gold website or GitHub repository between November 21-25 will have also received two suspicious files of unknown origin. The assumption is that these files were created to steal user funds or information. Developers are urging those who downloaded the Windows wallet client during this time period to proceed with caution. Some have even suggested fully wiping any machines that downloaded the infected files, in order for users to protect themselves and their funds. “Anyone who downloaded the Windows Wallet file between November 21, 2017, 09:39 UTC, and November 25, 2017, 22:30 UTC, should not use the file in any way. If the file was used, the computer on which it was used should be addressed with extreme caution; the file should be deleted, the machine should be thoroughly checked for malware and viruses (or wiped clean), and any cryptocurrencies with wallets accessible on that machine should be moved to new wallet addresses immediately,” the team wrote. Numbers of those affected by the security breach and how many, if any, have subsequently lost funds have still yet to be determined. The Linux file was not affected by the breach, and the GitHub repository has now been secured to prevent any future breach from occurring. However, users should still verify that the updated wallet download checksum matches the checksum listed on the Bitcoin Gold website. Bitcoin Gold has dropped nearly 25% since the hack was announced, and is currently trading at $305. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Frank-Peters",30-Nov,2017

" Sir Jon Cunliffe has officially declared that digital currency Bitcoin is no threat to the economy, nor is it a threat to financial organizations. This, of course, differs from what Nobel Prize Winner Joseph Stiglitz had to say about the leading cryptocurrency.  The Bank of England Deputy Governor gave an interview to BBC Radio 5 Live in which he stated that Bitcoin was far too small to show any signs of a threat to the global economy. Cunliffe noted that it is important for investors to do a thorough analysis of the currency and the reasons behind its success in order to avoid risks.  “This is not at a size where it’s a macroeconomic risk to the global economy, but when prices are moving like that, my view would be investors need to do their homework. This is not a currency in the accepted sense. There’s no central bank that stands behind it. For me, it’s much more like a commodity.” Over the course of the past few weeks, Bitcoin has seen a number of novel price hikes. To no surprise, this led various analysts and experts to debate on whether or not the currency will continue to grow in the future.  That said, well-known billionaire Mike Novogratz has estimated that Bitcoin will hit the mark of $40,000 in the next 13 months.  Featured Image: twitter",30-Nov,2017

Bloomberg has reported that the southern Ukrainian shipper is in talks with a client for its first Bitcoin transaction. If all goes as planned, Varamar Ltd. will accept the cryptocurrency in future transactions.  As mentioned, this is significant news as the shipping industry tends to be known for not adopting new technologies. But, Bitcoin and Bitcoin transactions seems to be solving a crucial process that has affected the modern shipping sector for years.  Here’s what Varamar founder Alexander Varvarenko had to say about the matter: “Paperwork for transactions is a complicated issue with banks, and Bitcoin payments will help solve that by being faster.” Now that Varamar has made the first move, other industry shippers are starting to tune in.

Zimbabwe has been plagued with years of devastating hyperinflation and just recently the citizens forced the resignation of their long-time president Robert Mugabe, further adding to the financial uncertainty of the country. This partnership has claimed to have found a reasonable solution for Zimbabwe to provide some stability and aid in their collapsing economy.   CEO Sheffield Clark of Coinsource made a statement about the partnership stating:  “Dash’s entrance in Africa will significantly improve the lives of thousands of people in Zimbabwe, who will enjoy access to a better form of currency, outside the failing fiat, failing USD-pegged bonds, and dirty dollar bills. From 1980 to 2017, under the rule of President Mugabe, Zimbabweans became an average of 15% poorer – it’s humbling to know that one of our industry peers has the ability to turn that around, and affect so many people in such a positive way.” As this partnership advances and the other major cryptocurrencies continue to rise, DASH’s price should continue its bullish momentum.

" More and more people are looking to ‘buy bitcoin with credit card’, according to Google Trends, which has captured this phrase being typed into the search engine at increasing numbers ever since the cryptocurrency hit record highs. Bitcoin has increased almost 10-fold in this past year alone, and this past weekend the cryptocurrency breached the $9,000 barrier. Already, it is nearing the $10,000 mark, so it’s hardly surprising that so many people would be curious about the topic and interested in getting into the market through the use of a credit card. There are those who remain wary of the cryptocurrency surge, though. Ken Griffin, Citadel hedge manager, told CNBC that “these bubbles tend to end in tears,” while Mitchell Goldberg, head of ClientFirst Strategy, says “we’ve entered the final and stupidest part of the bull market.” Regardless of these warnings, the combined crypto market has reached a record $309.9 billion. To give that some perspective, Visa is worth $254 billion, and the Bank of America sits at $277.3 billion. Bitcoin isn’t without its enthusiasts. Billionaire investor and hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz has said “Bitcoin could be at $40,000 at the end of 2018. It easily could.” Analyst and founder of Standpoint Research Ronnie Moas believes a more conservative route is in Bitcoin’s future, reaching $14,000 in 2018.

" According to a recent analysis that looked primarily at supply and demand, the Bitcoin bull run will come to an end only because of the plethora of supply, and not because of a lack of buyers, which is what everyone forecasted. Essentially, the supply will come via new ways of trading Bitcoin, a digital currency, and from Bitcoin hard forks, which is a term used to describe a radical change to the protocol that makes previously invalid transactions/blocks valid. Back in the late 1990’s, there was a dot-com bubble, which is where this analysis comes from. If you were a company that had .com in your name during the dot-com bubble, then you would receive a major market increase. That said, the dot-com bubble came to an end after a large number of new .com initial public offerings took over the market. There was a time when the market absorbed them, but eventually, the market saw the problem and corrected it, which pulled the rug out from the majority of those businesses and like Darwin said, only the strongest survived. Perhaps one of the most important aspects of Bitcoin is its limited supply. If you were to ask anyone familiar with Bitcoin, they will tell you that only 21 mln Bitcoin will ever exist. So, the question that remains is: with such limited supply, how could an oversupply of the cryptocurrency occur? This is not a simple question to answer as it varies depending on how you look at it. To begin, Bitcoin hard forks are now developing new derivatives from the original currency. Take Bitcoin Cash for instance: this hard fork has caused a brand new Bitcoin with a market capitalization of $26 billion. According to the analysis, “…as the river of ways to invest in cryptocurrencies widens, the flood that has lifted the price of the Bitcoin will surely recede, and, as always, much faster than people expect.” Featured Image: twitter",28-Nov,2017
" Bitcoin has been making major worldwide news headlines for the past week, smashing its own records and now has broken over the $10,000 mark.  The biggest unsolved mystery with the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value is who exactly Satoshi Nakamoto is. The white paper launched by the alias name was back in November of 2008, after the large housing/stock market crash.  No actual person or group since then has come forward and claimed the rights to inventing this idea and technology.  Recently, a software engineering intern at SpaceX by the name of Sahil Gupta wrote a post on the website, with the suspicion that Nakamoto is Tesla’s CEO and SpaceX’s founder, the one and only Elon Musk.  What kind of evidence does this intern have for this claim? Nothing definite but his logic is relatively fair. The original white paper written back in 2008 was by someone with “a deep understanding of economics and cryptography,” which Gupta knows that Musk has. He claims that Musk is an expert of the coding language C++, and that is the code Bitcoin was written in. Gupta discusses Mr. Musks’s drive towards his self-taught polymath that he built his rockets on for SpaceX and could have invented Bitcoin. Gupta goes on explain why Musk would have created Bitcoin back in 2008, saying: “It was 2008 (Great Recession), and he may have been motivated to solve the lack of trust in banks by creating a currency that doesn’t need them.” Back in 2014, a tweet was uncovered from Musk was in which he admits coyly that he is Satoshi.  Source: Twitter  He ends the article by personally thanking Musk, “Elon – if you are Satoshi, thank you. If not, well, thanks for the Tesla Roadster.” What are your thoughts?

What saved the original blockchain, however, was the fact that Bitcoin Cash’s difficulty protocol caught up with it and the miners began mining the original blockchain once more. At its peak on November 12th, BCH reached a high of $2306.15 but now, at press time is trading at $1571.58. Despite its past issues with Bitcoin, it still reigns supreme when it comes to all the digital currencies on the market, with its market cap three times the size of the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum. It has seen its fair share of difficulties over the years but still has managed to rebound quickly and break record-after-record. Back in the middle of October, a Wall Street strategist by the name of Tom Lee predicted that Bitcoin would reach $25,000 by 2020. At the time, everyone thought he was crazy but now, it doesn’t seem that far off. As the Bitcoin’s developing team continues to work on SegWit2x, the block size limitations still remain. As BTC’s price continues its climb, we will see how much the block sizes actually affect transactions and what its dev team will do next. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© nevarpp",28-Nov,2017
" Bitcoin Gold (BTG) may not be living up to its hype, despite its recent successes. Bitcoin Gold was meant to make mining more democratic and has jumped to being the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It reached a high of $413.74 on November 24, doubling its prices since November 19. However, despite these notable jumps, not everyone feels it is worth it. Social media comments show that some investors think BTG is overvalued and that there are few apparent use cases. This makes the $400 gains speculative unless traders are otherwise anticipating use cases to appear in the future. This looks like it may not be the case though, as price analysis indicates a correction is what the future actually holds. BTG may end up dropping to $250 levels in the short-run. But it could also go up to $480 levels. The next 12 hours will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin gold is worth it or not. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© Merlinus74",27-Nov,2017
" As Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new record high for the third week in a row, there have been some speculations in the financial industry that institutional investors might seek a safe haven in digital currency in the future. Max Keiser ‘s prediction last week of BTC eventually reaching $100,000 doesn’t seem so far off now, as its price begins to climb and top financial heads, have begun to jump on board.  Mikhail Mashchenko, EToro analyst, spoke to RT and states, “financial institutions could look to Bitcoin if major financial crash hits global markets.” He added: “The demand for Bitcoin is growing as the crypto market has become less volatile, and an increasing number of professional investors see it as insurance.” The stock market is currently in its second-longest bullish streak in history, currently at 104 months, Wall Street is gearing up for its inevitable shift. The longest streak in history was after the year 2000 where it made a 113-month run. If Maschenko’s predictions are correct, Bitcoin will have some sort of play in all of it. In the financial sector, it seems that there have been competing opinions on the cryptocurrency space. Just last week, JPMorgan announced that they will be offering Bitcoin futures set to launch in two weeks on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Many of the major European banks have been on opposite spectrums when it comes to supporting or bashing Bitcoin. What’s most exciting about this the current JPMorgan news is their CEO, Jamie Dimon, has been consistently in the news for slamming Bitcoin calling it a “fraud” but now his company, will be participating in the upcoming futures trades. When and if the stream of institutional investors start dipping their toes and invest large amounts of capital into cryptocurrencies a few of those predictions could be made true. Tom Lee, a 25 year Wall Street strategist, predicted back in August that Bitcoin would reach $6,000 by mid-2018 and in five years would reach $25,000. When a lot of regulations hit at the beginning of September, he held his ground on predictions despite being widely criticized. Lee’s prediction of $6,000 back in August now seems extremely conservative, whereas Mashchenko’s belief now is that Bitcoin will reach $10,000 by the end of 2017. “We could see a Bitcoin at $10,000 in a month or so. However, such a surge will be based on emotions, not on fundamental factors. So, further growth of the cryptocurrency will require something more than euphoria.”  Source: CoinMarketCap His predictions do not seem far off, seeing as Bitcoin has surged in price over $1,000 in just a couple of days. At press-time Bitcoin is trading at $9714.02 and up 3.78% for the day. At the rate of its current growth, Mashchenko prediction could happen within the current week.

" Bitcoin’s “mining” network uses more electricity in a year than the whole of Ireland, according to statistics released as the currency broke $9,000 for the first time.  According to Digiconomist, the estimated power use of the Bitcoin network, which is responsible for verifying transactions made with cryptocurrency, is 30.14TWh a year, which exceeds that of 19 other European countries. At a continuous power drain of 3.4GW, it means the network consumes five times more electricity than is produced by the largest wind farm in Europe, the London Array in the outer Thames Estuary, at 630MW.  As such, at those levels of electricity consumption, each individual Bitcoin transaction uses almost 300KWh of electricity- enough to boil around 36,000 kettles full of water. Although power consumption of other payment networks is harder to isolate, one of Visa’s two US data centers reportedly runs on about 2% of the power required by Bitcoin. Between them, those two datacenters conduct around 200m transactions a day; the Bitcoin network handless fewer than 350,000.  As the price of Bitcoin surges, so does the value of the reward, entailing that more miners put more computers to the task of running the network. But since the price of Bitcoin doesn’t necessarily rise in step with the number of transactions, that disconnect means the currency uses a significant amount of power per transaction in period of high prices.

" Bitcoin will be showcased on another TV show this upcoming Thursday, the 30th on the American Network CBS. The Big Bang Theory (BBT), will base its entire episode around Bitcoin as its cast will find a laptop full of the cryptocurrency. The BBT is currently airing its 11th season and is one of America’s most popular sitcoms. The show is centered around a group of friends who lean more on the ‘geeky’ genius side that reside in Pasadena, California. CBS’s top-rated show is infused with comic book collections, video games, and endless scientific humor.  Thursday’s show will be called “The Bitcoin Entanglement” and will expose millions of viewers to the world of cryptocurrency. For those familiar with the show, the BBT cast will find a laptop belonging to an ex of Penny’s that hold Bitcoins. The group is surprised that a single Bitcoin costs $5,000 USD and remembers that they “mined” some a while back. They all join in on a conversation as to how they would spend their Bitcoin money but decide to remove the show’s main character, Sheldon, from the investment split. Sheldon decides to mess with the gang, who discovers that the Bitcoin wallet is empty but Sheldon’s the only one that knows where these funds are stored. Bitcoin investors should be pretty enthusiastic to see their beloved cryptocurrency on a popular television sitcom showcasing the cryptocurrency, mining process and its wallets. BBT holds a current 8.3 rating on IMDb and should have close to 12.6 million viewers this coming Thursday.  Lately, Bitcoin has been debuted on other popular tv shows such as ABC’s Grey’s Anatomy. Airing two Thursday’s ago, a hacker held the tv’s show’s hospital system ransom, in exchange for 5,000 Bitcoin, which would be worth $200,000,000, as per the show. Bitcoin has also been previously mentioned on other popular TV shows such as Mr. Robot, The Simpsons, Jeopardy and the Good Wife. The BBT’s show was filmed a while back when Bitcoin’s price was around $5,000 per BTC but now it’s pushing almost double, at around $9,700 and has a $160B market cap. This week’s episode is certain to bring more users to inquire about the cryptocurrency market. Featured Image: twitter",27-Nov,2017
" As of November 27th, bitcoin price achieved a new all-time high for the second time in the past 24 hours, surpassing $9,771 and moving closer towards $10,000.  Yesterday, on November 26th, CNN noted that the price of Bitcoin saw a new all-time high at $9,060. Within 24 hours, the price of Bitcoin increased from $9,060 to $9,771, by nearly $700 overnight.  Since then, bitcoin price has stabilized in the $9,550 region. Short-term indicators such as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) reveal strong short-term momentum for Bitcoin.  Billionaire investor Mike Novogratz predict that Bitcoin price will surpass $10,000 this year.  The CME Group Bitcoin futures exchange launch is imposing a similar impact that the Bitcoin ETF had on the global Bitcoin market in March. The difference between the March Bitcoin ETF anticipation and the CME Group Bitcoin futures exchange hype is that the latter is guaranteed, given that another Bitcoin options exchange in LedgerX has already been approved and regulated by the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Further, the adoption of Bitcoin as a store of value and as a payment method is increasing at a rapid rate. In countries like Japan, major retailers and businesses like Bic Camera, Peach Airline, and Capsule hotels have already started to accept Bitcoin through strategic partnerships with cryptocurrency exchanges.  If Bitcoin’s current preference as a payment method continues to surge throughout 2018, its price will very likely reach the $10,000 mark. Featured Image: twitter",27-Nov,2017
" Iran has been allowing Bitcoin into the country, but not without managing it. Here’s a look at what sort of combative efforts they are making towards the cryptocurrency, and some reasons behind it. The High Council of Cyberspace (HCC) is the authority deciding on the entry of Bitcoin into the country, and so far, they have welcomed it, so long as it is controlled. HCC secretary Abolhassan Firouzabadi explains further, “We [at the HCC] welcome Bitcoin, but we must have regulations for Bitcoin and any other digital currency […] Our view regarding Bitcoin is positive, but it does not mean that we will not require regulations in this regard because following the rules is a must.” Bitcoin, in Iran, has been used as payment methods in both financial services and startup companies. Firouzabadi stated, “many in Iran are dealing with Bitcoin, be it purchasing, selling or mining it, and even dealing with it in exchange shops, creating content and establishing startups.” Due to this, the HCC, as well as the Central Bank of Iran, have begun to study cryptocurrencies to better understand the benefits and drawbacks of them. One of the main reasons behind Iran’s welcoming stance on cryptocurrency is a result from when, in 2012, Iranian banks were removed from the SWIFT payments network, subsequently removing Iran from the global banking system. This lasted four years. It’s possible that Iran is trying to get ahead of the curve on cryptocurrencies, and by regulating them, they hold better control.

" Square’s Cash app, that features payments between friends, recently granted users the use of Bitcoin. The company’s CFO and operations lead Sarah Friar indicated that this move is about Square’s own innovation and not Bitcoin’s validation.  Square recently beat out Venmo as one of the most downloaded financial apps because of its usability. Its shares jumped over 4% when the news broke, as it signals Bitcoin trading for mainstream traders. The app has its limitations, however. Currently, users can not complete transactions in the cryptocurrency. Credit Suisse analysts also pointed out that Square is well positioned to allow cryptocurrency transactions at the point of sale. According to CNBC, the institutions recently elaborated its comments, adding that Square can add millions in annual revenue by supporting the cryptocurrency.  Credit Suisse estimates that Square can add 10 million bitcoin buyers over two years, which would drive its revenue up by $30 million. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© merznatalia",27-Nov,2017
" In 2009, a man by the name of James Howells mined 7,500 Bitcoins with his laptop. He later had to take his laptop apart, and the hard drive containing the Bitcoins ended up in a drawer, which, three years later, ended up being cleared out and the hard drive was tossed. The 7,500 Bitcoins have gone from being worth $600,000 to $5 million to its current worth today of $72 million. The hard drive and its rich contents have long been lost in a Newport landfill, and there has been much speculation recently about whether or not it will ever be retrieved and what this retrieval could mean for Howells. The funds to dig through the landfill were too much for Howells, and he has since stated, “I’m at the point where it’s either laugh about it or cry about it. Why aren’t I out there with a shovel now? I think I’m just resigned to never being able to find it.” Other speculators looking to get their hands on the valuable hard drive won’t find the task so easy. Beyond the landfill being off-limits to the public, a Newport council spokesperson has said that if the hard drive were to be found, it would be returned to Howells as the rightful owner. If the hard drive does still exist and hasn’t deteriorated away within the landfill, then it will be the most expensive and sought-after piece of junk anyone will have ever seen.

" With the success of Bitcoin comes the success of GPU manufacturing firms, Nvidia and AMD. Specifically, Bitcoin has risen $2,000 in the past few weeks and has indirectly given a 2% increase to companies like Nvidia and AMD. Why would a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin have any sort of effect on GPU manufacturers? Well, that has a lot to do with the form of the cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is online money, which means that to be involved with it in any way, you need to have access to a computer. From amateurs looking to get into mining to the more serious investor involved with cryptocurrency-related businesses, a graphics card is going to be bought in order to process it all. That means the more people getting into Bitcoin, the more graphics cards are required for them, the more money companies like Nvidia and AMD make. The rising stock in GPU manufacturers also comes from the recently announced upgrade to Ethereum’s Blockchain. The upgrade requires workers, who require GPUs, increasing demand for them further.  So long as cryptocurrency remains online, which is, at its core, the whole point of cryptocurrency, then GPUs will be needed to process everything cryptocurrency-related, and so, companies producing these valuable items will flourish.

" Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has rallied back above the $1500 mark today as its lead developer pronounced Bitcoin (BTC) “dead.” Tuesday on Twitter, Deadal Nix, tweeted while Bitcoin started its bullish climb, the August hard fork that created BCH meant that Bitcoin already no longer existed. Deadal Nix’s tweet said, “Bitcoin is dead. It was split in two. There is Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin Core/Legacy. Deal with it.” Bitcoin’s core community responded immediately, Charlie Shrem was the first noting that “Nix” publicly calls himself “shitlord.”  Source: https://twitter.com/CharlieShrem/status/933533015292211200 The tension begins to rise as BCH is on a current track of doubling its low Nov 17th value of $975. At Press Time Bitcoin Cash is trading at $1548, up 17% in just 24 hours.  BTX is currently trading just under $8,200 breaking its own records mere days ago. Two weeks ago when BCH made its bullish climb they flipped and Bitcoin dropped substantially. Bitcoin ended up rebounding within a few days and crushed its own record.

" While most cryptocurrency prices continue to ascend, Bitcoin’s price implies that it still reigns supreme, when it comes to digital currency.  Russia Today’s host, Max Keiser, just projected that one day Bitcoin will reach around $100,000. Bitcoin’s price hit a record high over the weekend, pushing past the $8,000 mark and defeated all cryptocurrency skepticism when it’s scheduled upgrade SegWit2x didn’t occur. On Monday and Tuesday of this week, Bitcoin was pushing the $8,400 mark breaking previous record highs.   Keiser’s belief is centered around Bitcoin’s ability to withstand multiple changes, proving it to be the most “dependable” and sturdy of the cryptocurrencies.  He said: “Bitcoin will dominate and lead crypto going forward. Hundreds of obituaries have been written about Bitcoin and none of them have come true and none will. Fact is, Bitcoin is a gift from God to help humanity sort out the mess it has made with its money.” While this new declaration from Keiser sheds a positive light on Bitcoin, it doesn’t change the fact that the network still needs room to grow. While the upgrade was postponed, for now, the issues it aimed at solving are not going away. The increasing amount of transaction on the original blockchain is putting a major strain on the network’s capacity and the accumulation of backlogged transactions makes Bitcoin’s blockchain burdensome while being used as a payment method.  Keiser believes that Bitcoin’s focus should be on its role as “digital gold” and leave the payments to other blockchains. He said:  “Dash is emerging as the crypto payment rail while Bitcoin asserts itself as Gold 2.0. I suggest those frustrated by the Bitcoin scaling debate to embrace Dash for payments and leave Bitcoin Core alone to continue working on Gold 2.0.” Many major investors appear to be responding positively to the story of Bitcoin being digital gold. There has been talk circulating about the potential of institutional investors bursting into the market with billion-dollar investments. It seems like the news about the upcoming launch of CME’s Bitcoin futures seems to be affecting the market positively.  Keiser’s forecast of Bitcoin doesn’t seem so far off now given the popularity it’s been getting in the mainstream market. He even went so much as to compare Bitcoin to Apple: “I remember when I bought Apple stock in the late 1990’s when it was valued for less than $100 million, Michael Dell publicly said that Apple should shut its doors and stop the embarrassment of being in business. Twenty years later, it’s approaching a $1 trillion market cap, and nobody talks about Michael Dell anymore.” Featured Image: twitter",23-Nov,2017
" Tobam, a French asset management firm which has $9 billion in assets, announced today that it will launch Europe’s first Bitcoin centered mutual fund. Their alternative investment fund illustrates the latest bid to attract investors to Bitcoin. The Financial Times reports that their fund has been approved by France’s financial regulator the Autorité des Marchés Financiers, was audited by PwC, and Caceis is going to be holding custody of the cryptocurrencies that are tied to the funds. Tobam’s President, Yves Choueifaty, said in a statement: “This first move in the world of cryptocurrencies showcases our dedication to remaining ahead of the curve and to provide our clients with innovative products in the context of efficient (i.e. unpredictable) markets.” The president also told the publication that they have “found some investors to launch the fund” and they have has “a lot of interest” when it comes to Bitcoin.  It is unsurprising that some investors want some exposure to the digital currency market, as Bitcoin has surged 5,000% against the dollar. There was now 55 dedicated cryptocurrency hedge funds and the CME Group is set to launch their bitcoin futures contracts next month.  It still is unknown if Tobam’s products will strike even more interest but with the most recent news and push towards the cryptocurrency it definitely seems that there will be.

" Over the weekend, a hacker hit Sacramento Regional Transit (SacRT) and deleted around 30 million files. These erased files contained the important programs the city uses for dispatching and planning the bus routes, along with their bus driver assignments.  It started on Saturday when the hackers took over the website and completely defaced it with a note stating, “I’m sorry to modify the home page, i’m good hacker, I just want to help you fix these vulnerabilities. This is one of the loopholes, modify the homepage.”  After the company was notified by residents, out of safety they took the entire website down, along with the credit card processing system.  The hacker then demanded a single Bitcoin, worth now over $8,000 USD, in order to stop the attacks and allow the IT team at SacRT to get the system back and running. Their exact note stated, “Hello, I will always attack your website, we are hackers. We can do everything. Pay us now to stop attacking.” They have not paid the ransom and are working diligently to get the system up and running. A representative told FoxNews that they back up their files “every day” and are restoring it via backup. The hack and ransom are extremely odd due to the size. By comparison, other hacks this year ranged from $250,000 to over $80 million. HBO and Equifax are the most notable companies that were hacked on a larger scale. It is still unclear as to why the ransom was so small, in comparison to the disruption it caused to the city of Sacramento.  Featured Image: twitter",21-Nov,2017
" Tether, a startup that offers dollar-backed cryptocurrency, announced on Monday that its system was hacked, with more than $30 million US dollars worth of Bitcoin stolen. In the removed post from the company’s website, Tether blamed a “malicious action by an external attacker” for the heist. Tether, which was originally called Realcoin, is a platform that serves as a proxy for USD that can be sent between various exchanges. The company said it is moving quickly to make sure the exchanged money does not trade and reintroduced into the digital currency economy.   Tether wrote a statement saying: “$30,950,010 USDT was removed from the Tether Treasury wallet on Nov. 19, 2017 and sent to an unauthorized bitcoin address. As Tether is the issuer of the USDT managed asset, we will not redeem any of the stolen tokens, and we are in the process of attempting token recovery to prevent them from entering the broader ecosystem.” They are planning on releasing a new version of the software client Omni Core, which Tether runs on top of, to tie up the stolen currency. If all the nodes in the bitcoin network accept the new software, it would completely blacklist the stolen address and would trigger an emergency hard fork to hold the funds. Employees at Omni Core are hoping to release their new software in the days ahead, in hopes of retrieving the stolen Bitcoin.  Cryptocurrency investors took to twitter to voice their speculations on the entire situation, as it related to Tether and their level of control over their own software and the blockchain. In one particular thread, an investor said, “The level of control they exert over this blockchain is unusual, to the point where it could trigger regulation.” Following the announcement of the hack, other exchanges that grant order-book trading on Tether, like Huobi and OKCoin, immediately took steps and froze their trading.

" With the Chicago Mercantile Exchange set to launch its Bitcoin futures in three weeks, Bitcoin’s price has seen records highs, something that one Capital Management founder has taken note of. Despite the rocky week, Bitcoin had last week with the cancellation of its upgrade, SegWit2x, it seems the cryptocurrency has made a comeback and then some. At press time, Bitcoin has reached a record-high of trading at $8332.84. With the slump in the price reaching almost $6,500 last week, it left a lot of investors or those thinking of investing on the fence. However, the founder and chief investment officer of Morgan Creek Capital Management, which carries $3.7 billion in assets under its management, is still confident in the cryptocurrency and has predicted it will reach $400,000 in the long-run. Mark Yusko has been a senior investor for almost 25 years and invested in Bitcoin back in 2011. He regrets taking the “picks and shovels” method of investing and wishes he would’ve invested more. The Capital Management founder acknowledges why most financial higher-ups have such a negative reaction when it comes to bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies and believes the physical financial institution will one day become obsolete. Yukso states, “It is extremely natural to expect banks to be dismissive and skeptical because this is a disruptive technology. This will change the supply and demand equation for banking. It is that big. I’m not surprised at all that bankers, financiers and Saudi Princes are coming out against it. This is a truly disruptive technology.” He also added further to his statement of banks becoming obsolete, saying, “If you think about it why do we need a giant building to have a bank? We don’t.” In his eyes, money is digitized now. Yukso explains, “One of my greatest fears or nightmares is that I may wake up one morning and the bank says I have no money. How would I prove that I do? I don’t have physical records anymore, I don’t have a statement that says you have X dollars. So I think Bitcoin and blockchain and Ethereum too – are exciting new technologies.” The hedge fund manager compared the blockchain and bitcoin, to the internet thirty years ago. Noting that it has the complete capacity to “change everything” and that internet of money is real and just as crucial as the internet was in the 90s.

" In a group of reports on Monday, the Russian Minister of Communications and Mass Media Nikolai Nikiforov, made a statement that it is highly unlikely that Russia will ever legalize Bitcoin.  Nikiforov prompted that Bitcoin would remain completely outside of legality but the technology it’s founded upon, the blockchain, is “entirely possible.”  He said, “Bitcoin is a foreign project for using blockchain technology, the Russian law will never consider Bitcoin as a legal entity in the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation. However, I think that it is quite possible to use blockchain technology and the use of various digital tokens.”  The minister’s comments add even more to the confusion of Russian lawmakers stance on cryptocurrency. Many of their senior figures in the past have given off many different conflicting notions as to how Russia will act on this new cryptocurrency sensation. Early in October of this year, it was reported that the Russian ministry had submitted a document to the government enclosed with details of cryptocurrency adoption.  At that time, Nikiforov said, “We have submitted a draft decree regulating the legal adoption of cryptocurrency. That is why I think we should go ahead from the technological viewpoint, providing such instruments. It is hardly possible to get anything via restrictions amid digital economic development.”  Ultimately, the minister states the final decision is in the hands of the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Russia. However, some feel an outright ban of cryptocurrency across Russia is most likely inevitable. Featured Image: twitter",20-Nov,2017
" Still pending regulatory approval, CME has just announced on their website their plans of launching Bitcoin futures on December 10th and trading set to begin on December 11th.  The world’s largest options exchange first announced its plans of offering the futures opportunity, at the end of October. At that time, CME’s Chairman and CEO, Terry Duffy, stated: “Given increasing client interest in the evolving cryptocurrency markets, we have decided to introduce a bitcoin futures contract — As the world’s largest regulated FX marketplace, CME Group is the natural home for this new vehicle that will provide investors with transparency, price discovery and risk transfer capabilities.” CME has already released its Bitcoin future market specs on its website and is gearing up for the approval of the launch. The futures will be listed on Clearport, CME, and CME’s Globex central standard time, with set limits on 1,000 contracts.  Source: http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_contract_specifications.html Each contract will be based on the price of BTC per USD and each one will have a unit of five index points, which constitutes 5 BTC. As shown in the graph above, the minimum price fluctuations are set at a total of $25 each and the monthly contracts are listed for the nearest 2 months in the March quarterly cycle.  Bitcoin enthusiasts and some speculators assume these futures will bring about less volatility in the Bitcoin spot markets. The company’s contracts will be issued for $25 USD but according to further information provided on CME’s website, will not swing more than 20 percent on the previous settlement price.  Unfortunately, with so much unknown and this being the first cryptocurrency trading on a grand scale, this “taming” is a theoretical concept.  The Bitcoin community and its investors seem excited for the weeks to come, as it could be monumental for the digital currency. Featured Image: twitter",20-Nov,2017
" On November 15th, Square Inc announced they would begin testing the support of Bitcoin through its Cash payments app. According to Paul Condra of Credit Suisse, Square can add tens of millions to its revenue with their Bitcoin exploration. In a note to his clients Monday, he stated: “While we are positive on Square’s strategy, to the extent it confers legitimacy on Bitcoin and prompts adoption by other providers (i.e., PayPal) the biggest beneficiary may be the crypto-asset industry. We estimate that if Square can accumulate 10m bitcoin buyers over two years (tracking Coinbase’s growth), this could drive an incremental $30m in revenue” That figure stems from the belief that Square will charge a fee of 1.5 percent each transaction and on average, Condra estimates a customer would spend around $200 annually on bitcoin purchases. The Credit Suisse analyst echoed his neutral rating and increased his price target from $37 to $31. Following this report, Square’s shares closed at just under a 3 percent increase.

" According to various news sources, the first atomic Bitcoin Litecoin swap on a Lightning network testnet has been deemed a success.  Why is this so important, you ask? The swap is monumental due to it being ‘off-chain’ which means the ownership of the coins switched hands but there was no recording of it on either blockchain.  These swaps are a form of a smart contract and allow a frictionless decentralized exchange of cryptocurrency between two compatible networks. This could be deemed as a solution for decentralized exchanges and could create “families” of coins that would allow different functionalities.  Charlie Lee, Litecoin’s founder, states: “Previous atomic swaps that I have done were on-chain, and had the on-chain limitations of slow [transactions] and high transaction fees. Off-chain atomic swaps are significantly better. They are instant, [have] low fees, and better protect one’s privacy.” This method would allow users to pass different cryptocurrencies to other people without having to wait for on-chain confirmations and would have substantially lower fees. This could deem as a simple solution for scalability for bitcoin, as well as produce much faster transactions.  Another benefit to these particular transactions is they are completely and fully anonymous, due to leaving no trace on either chain. They are entirely complete transactions but untraceable.

The original coin has seen a remarkable “comeback” from its record lows just a week ago, near the $5,600 mark. Since its lows on Sunday, it has rebounded 30 percent. According to CoinMarketCap, the coin’s market cap, or the total value of the digital coins that are currently in circulation, went from $92 billion to just at $133.5 billion.  Source: CoinMarketCap.com   The crypto’s crazy weekend was the result of a cancellation announcement made on the morning of the 8th, in regards to the network upgrade, SegWit2x, that was set to launch November 16th. This upgrade was aimed at improving the transaction speed on the blockchain, that has slowed down a substantial amount over the years. If the upgrade took place, it would have been by way of a “hard fork” which would have resulted in miners mining the old blockchain resulting in a new bitcoin spin-off formed. The coin has already had two hard forks, earlier this year that was the result of the creation of Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold. Cash made headways this weekend towards their push to become the reigning cryptocurrency when miners started dumping Bitcoin’s blockchain and started mining Bitcoin Cash. The miners’ incentive to do this was the result of the difficulty protocol set on the blockchain network that made Bitcoin less profitable to mine and its off-shoot profitable. Eventually, Bitcoin Cash’s difficulty protocol ended up getting in the way when miners started flooding the system and ended up severely slowing down mining, which resulted in miners switching back to the original blockchain. The investor community has been slowly warming up to the idea of moving their money out of bonds and equities and into bitcoin. Projected for mid-December, the CME Group will be launching their bitcoin futures listing. As well as cryptocurrencies most popular wallet, CoinBase, announcing just yesterday that they are soon to launch a product for institutional clients. As the price of the cryptocurrency has shown in the last week, the market seems to be taking this news fairly well. Featured Image: twitter",17-Nov,2017
" Two new Bitcoin futures projects are set to launch soon. Vontobel and Leonteq Securities AG, Swiss asset management firms, will not allow their customers to bet against the price of Bitcoin. According to Reuters, Vontobel is launching these futures on the SIX Exchange today. This includes two mini-futures products, that only represent a fraction of the value of standard futures.  Eric Blattman, Head of Public Distribution of Financial Products, states their products have a goal to satisfy the urge of investors for more options, specifically cryptocurrency trading.  Blattman said, “We have seen big demand for our long tracker certificate from investors interested in playing the upside potential of Bitcoin and now they have also the possibility to hedge their position or go short.” As reported by Bloomberg yesterday, Leonteq Securities AG is working on a separate project that only has a two-month maturity. Manuel Durr, head of public solutions at Leonteq, stated: “the initial feedback has been extremely positive, clients do very much appreciate the possibility of choosing between a long or a short investment in bitcoin.” This big move in Switzerland is in the middle of growing interest in cryptocurrency among typical institutional investors.  In about a month, The U.S’s major CME Group is set to launch their new bitcoin futures. Also, a New York-based startup, LedgerX, has already begun offering cryptocurrency future trades and in their first week, $1 million was already traded.  Featured Image: twitter",17-Nov,2017
" How high do Bitcoin’s prices have to reach before the typical Bitcoin investor sells it? According to a newly published survey from LendEDU, very high at $196,165 per bitcoin which is 30 times the currencies current market value. They conducted this survey earlier this month, with 564 Americans who have invested in Bitcoin. With the extremely small size of the group that was asked these questions, the findings should be read with reasonable caution.  Michael Brown, a Research Analyst with the Survey company LendEDU, had an interview with Fortune and confirmed the data results, “Believe it or not, that number and statement is true according to our polling data.” So, what would it take to actually reach that number? When the tech-savvy younger generation spends Bitcoin, in all their everyday transactions and it steadily replaces the national currencies. Current Bitcoin investors envision that it will potentially reach that price point with the help of time and the younger generation jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon. Once that occurs, the cryptocurrency world will draw in “older” investors who were not previously sold on the concept’s potential.  Brown continued:  “As it stands today, the price of cryptocurrencies is rising rapidly yet many of the most influential, older investors are still not sold on Bitcoin and believe it will collapse. Just imagine when younger Americans develop more spending power and attempt to bring Bitcoin into the forefront of the U.S. economy? At that point, the price of Bitcoin will skyrocket.” How long exactly would this take? Possibly, a whole era.  In order for Bitcoin’s price to rise 30 times what it currently is, a generational transfer of power would need to occur. Millennials are going to need some time to establish wealth and build their presence in the economy before Bitcoin can be brought fully mainstream.  Featured Image: twitter",16-Nov,2017
" It was an exciting weekend for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), reaching an all-time high of $2,446.31 on November 12th. At press-time, it is now selling at $1017.79, a 58 percent decrease from its high this Sunday.  Source: CoinMarketCap During BCH’s high its rival, the original cryptocurrency Bitcoin dipped below $6,000. It’s pretty clear that this highly anticipated “flippening” of the two cryptocurrencies, that some Bitcoin Cash enthusiasts predicated is now nowhere in sight. Although it had definite momentum, Bitcoin Cash’s own difficulty protocol is what halted this from actually happening.  Source: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin, as shown in the graph above, had a rollercoaster of a weekend in conjunction and connection with Bitcoin Cash’s rise. Bitcoin’s hash rate drastically fell this weekend close to 50 percent, as Bitcoin miners dropped mining Bitcoin and jumped over to Bitcoin Cash due to the monetary mining reward potentials. As mentioned earlier, Bitcoin Cash’s own difficulty protocol was its own demise, as it made Bitcoin Cashless profitable to mine and users switched back to mining Bitcoin.  At press time, Bitcoin has broken its own all-time high record from back on Nov. 8 and is now selling at $7756.28 and is up 7 percent. A lot of this Bitcoin momentum stems from the major CME Group announcing Bitcoin future tradings launching the second week of December.  Featured Image: twitter",16-Nov,2017
" Morgan Stanley Chairman and CEO, James Gorman, had a lot to say about Bitcoin in an exclusive interview with CNBC.  Gorman states that despite it going up 700 percent this year the cryptocurrency is the definition of a “speculative investment and anyone thinking it might be stable is deluding themselves.”  Despite not sounding like a digital currency or bitcoin advocate, he did recognize the increasing adoption of it and its usability meant it was not going away “from one day to another.” Gorman goes on to describe Bitcoin as “not even close to a safe investment.” The CEO’s comments weren’t the most confident when it came to Bitcoin but it was a lot less harsh than other peers of his. JPMorgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, has had plenty to say on the world’s largest cryptocurrency and claims it to be a ‘fraud’ that will eventually blow up. The most notable comment he made recently was, “If you’re stupid enough to buy bitcoin, you’ll pay the price for it one day.” You can hear James Gorman’s full statements here.

" Russian cybercrime suspect, Alexander Vinnik, has been held in Greece since July when the U.S requested him to be arrested while he was on vacation with his family. He is directly tied to the obsolete BTC-e bitcoin exchange and is wanted by both the US and Russia for laundering Bitcoin.  His extradition hearing was set for today but was postponed because they are waiting for two witnesses to attend the hearing. It has been rescheduled for Dec. 6th. He is currently at the center of a judicial battle between the U.S and Russia, who is seeking his extradition on lesser charges. The U.S seeks to prosecute Mr. Vinnik for $4 Billion USD worth of laundered bitcoin through BTC-e, whereas Russia only accuses him of 667,000-ruble ($11,500) of fraud.  Athens courts have approved the extradition requests of both countries, but Vinnik is only appealing his extradition to the U.S. He is denying all charges on both sides but is not contesting being extradited to his home country. He has acknowledged working for BTC-e but strongly declares his innocence. Coincidentally, BTC-e has relaunched after their domain was confiscated by law enforcement and they deny any involvement with the suspect, Vinnik.   One of Vinnik’s lawyers, Alexandros Lykourezos, explains the reason for the postponement of the hearing by saying:  “We asked the court to postpone the hearing today of the U.S. request for the extradition of Vinnik so that two essential witnesses can come who couldn’t unfortunately come to Athens today. These witnesses will be able to testify and help the court understand the essential issues that arise from this case.” The suspect is being indicted by a grand jury in North District of California, as reported by the U.S Justice Department, and is facing charges of engaging in unlawful monetary transactions, money laundering, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. In the U.S these charges combined hold a maximum sentence of up to 20 years in federal prison. On December 6th Greece’s justice minister might have to make the final decision if Greece’s Supreme Court upholds the lower court’s order. Featured Image: twitter",15-Nov,2017
" I’m sure all of you at some point have made a purchase and the retail attendant used that tiny white square on a smart device to process a payment; Well, Square Inc has now jumped into the cryptocurrency space. This payment giant is letting a number of its users on its Square Cash app purchase Bitcoin. Square Cash, a main competitor of Venmo, allows its customers to send peer-to-peer payments and store money without the need to connect to a bank account.  Square has been making huge waves on Twitter, which I’m sure has made Jack Dorsey thrilled, as he is the CEO of both companies.  “First Square Cash. Then major banks,” one user wrote, via twitter.  Another wrote, “Bomb of the year: Buy Bitcoin with Square Cash. As easy as 123. Goodbye Coinbase.”  In an email statement sent Wednesday morning a Square Cash spokesperson states: “We’re always listening to our customers and we’ve found that they are interested in using the Cash App to buy Bitcoin. We’re exploring how Square can make this experience faster and easier, and have rolled out this feature to a small number of Cash App customers. We believe cryptocurrency can greatly impact the ability of individuals to participate in the global financial system and we’re excited to learn more here.”  Source: twitter Currently, the app only has the capabilities of letting its users buy, sell and hold Bitcoins but lacks the capability of making peer-to-peer payments with the cryptocurrency. Making payments to peers is the app’s primary use, and the company sees this as being the primary function to roll-out in the future.  Credit Suisse’s AG analyst Paul Condra had some positive things to say about the company. In a note to clients today,  he said, “Given Square’s tendency to move judiciously into new technologies, we expect it will do the same with bitcoin purchases. The upside could be significant if cryptocurrencies become more mainstream.” Both Bitcoin and Square have grown exponentially this year.

Back in 2014, Jack Dorsey let its e-commerce merchants accept Bitcoin but didn’t see much activity. He’s hoping for more activity with the cryptocurrency this go around.  Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#charts Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, has had a monumental year as well, as its value has soared up 7 times what it was since January 1st. Bitcoin now sits at just over $7200 a coin. It has the highest market cap, $113 billion, among thousands of other cryptocurrencies, and it speculated to continue its bullish climb despite a few bumps throughout the year.  With both Square and Bitcoin having monumental years, it’s easy to see why Dorsey and the Square Cash team are making moves towards Bitcoin. The main users of his app are the younger generation and he said in a statement that he sees digital currency especially appealing to this generation. He also recalls someone once telling him that, “Gold is a stupid rock.”  Venmo is owned by Paypal and is Square Cash’s largest competitor. They are also in a great position to offer bitcoin services. However, the company has announced no moves in this direction yet. The New York Times Reported back in October that Square Cash had passed Venmo as being the most frequently downloaded financial app on both Apple and Android phones.  With how hot cryptocurrency has become this year, maybe their Bitcoin buying/selling offering will make the app that much more appealing. Featured Image: beat.10ztalk.com",15-Nov,2017
" The British hedge fund founded in 1783, Man Group, is patiently waiting on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to launch their bitcoin futures scheduled for the second week of next month. Man Group’s CEO, Luke Ellis, told Reuters that his firm has plans of adding Bitcoin to their “investment universe” once CME’s futures contracts are approved and listed for trading.  The CEO stated: “Conceptually digital currencies are an interesting thing. It’s not part of our investment universe today – it could be. If there is a CME future on bitcoin, it would be.” Ellis believes that there are many hurdles cryptocurrencies still need to overcome to achieve mainstream adoption despite not having government backing, but he doesn’t believe that it currently makes them non-investable. He also told Reuters: “There is a big difference between a digital currency and a traditional currency…Traditional ones are supported by governments who have armies and tax men that can make people follow their rules, and digital ones don‘t,” he continued. “But that doesn’t invalidate digital currencies at all.” He did not state specifically if their firm will explore directly with the cryptocurrency markets or trade CME’s specific futures. Despite the uncertainty, this announcement is additional confirmation that mainstream investors are observing a way into the bitcoin environment. CME’s exchange is going to have “bumpers” to prevent the market from shifting too far one way, due to it being traded in the typical regulated environment. Trading can also be paused during times of high volatility. CME’s chairman, Leo Melamed, made a statement recently expressing his beliefs that using this framework will “tame bitcoin into a mainstream financial instrument.” Analysts are highly anticipating that after CME’s futures launch large figures of capital will flood in from Wall Street, minimizing Bitcoin’s volatility and aiding it in its maturity as an asset class.

" For years, finding ways to prove a person’s identity with 100 percent accuracy has been an extremely complex task. Iris scans, fingerprint cards, and cards such as a passport are used currently as proof of identity.  Unfortunately, most of these biometric systems demand large amounts of infrastructure and are costly, while the cheaper alternatives are not as secure. However, one thing may change that; Blockhain Digital Identification. Canada is now welcoming a new cost-effective identification platform that is based solely on blockchain technology and gives Canadian citizens the opportunity to prove who they are in an instant, with 100 percent accuracy. Blockchain technology is the underlying structure of this completely definitive and cost reducing solution. Individuals would store all of their personal encrypted data and information on a personal phone.  When they would need to share their identity at, let’s say an airport, they would give their private key to this institution in order for them to access this information. They would access this information through the blockchain and it would be made available to this specific institution only.  This option gives consumers a simple solution if they don’t want their information stored in various databases, making it more accessible for hackers to obtain such data. SelfKey, a similar startup, is now offering very similar solutions for those outside of Canada and are launching their token sales soon. The shift of moving personal data onto individual storage devices would keep more data secure as these large hackers wouldn’t be able to obtain large chunks of personal information in just one sweep. The most recent Equifax hack wouldn’t have occurred because each person’s data would be safely stored on their own individual devices with their own private keys. This blockchain identity system is set to launch in Canada in early 2018. Featured Image: twitter",15-Nov,2017
" Although it was a whirlwind weekend, it seems that Bitcoin is on the rise. At press time, it is up 10% in just 24 hours and its price is sitting at $7228.11. Starting Friday, the digital coin sat under $7000 up until this morning.  Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#charts The competitor that gave Bitcoin a run for its money this weekend, Bitcoin Cash, is currently down 8% in the last 24 hours and is sitting at $1227.31. Many predicted that after this weekend’s events there would be a complete swap of the two and the off-shoot would take over the entire market. It appears the weekend was full of highs and lows but essentially signified nothing. With such a substantial drop in the cryptocurrency over the weekend, a substantial buying opportunity arose. Investors that took advantage of the price ‘dip’ at around $5,700, saw a 20 percent return in just 72 hours. Further justifying the ever-present bitcoin investing strategy of buying in the dip and then “hold on for dear life.” The chaos was initiated by the planned upgrade, SegWit2x, being canceled a week ago.

" On the local Zimbabwe exchange of Golix, Bitcoin is currently trading large at the equivalent of $12,000 USD, per coin. This may seem absurd for most of us living elsewhere to spend so much on one Bitcoin but Zimbabweans, however, the cryptocurrency offers a rare “safe haven” from its country’s inevitable financial implosion due to hyperinflation.  There have been reports that over the years, the inflation had driven its residents to carry entire backpacks in cash in order to pay for weekly groceries. Cash is now running short in banks as inflation rises and banks are now putting caps as to how much can be spent outside of the country.  As residents are losing value to their bank deposits by the day, they’ve turned to Bitcoin out of complete desperation. Zimbabwe’s president, Robert Mugabe, is urging its residents to take risks on the cryptocurrency, as its country is in a complete desperate state. Arnold Manhizwa, a 34-year-old father of two that works for an IT and Telecoms Company, told Reuters, “I have now changed all my reserves to bitcoin because that is the only way I can protect my investment. If I have $500 in the bank I won’t get it back and I will be losing value, but when I have my bitcoin it is going up every day.” The banks have begun halting and capping Visa and Mastercard bank transactions overseas, and with that Zimbabweans have found it extremely difficult to make payments internationally. Using Bitcoin bypasses the need to get foreign currency from the banks for payments and even makes it easier to buy goods from the growing merchants that now accept cryptocurrency.  The central bank is responsible for approving overseas transactions and they’ve stated that they currently have an estimated $500 million in pending foreign payments. They also prioritize payments such as fuel and medication, making the process even slower. Some upper class families that have sent their sons and daughters overseas for university are finding it extremely difficult to help fund them, with these pending transactions.   An analyst setting up a Bitcoin trading desk at a local bank brought up that it may seem attractive to move everything over to Bitcoin now, but states, “Once foreigners sell their bitcoin, they won’t have a way of getting their money out.” Featured Image: undispatch.com",14-Nov,2017
" In an interview with CNBC yesterday, The CEO of the CME Group confirmed that they are set to launch Bitcoin futures trading by mid-December.  Terry Duffy suggested their introduction of these futures will now be “sometime in the second week” of December. Bitcoin’s markets have fluctuated over the past week, as their projected upgrade was halted and markets seriously challenged by its rival Bitcoin Cash. Duffy’s statement yesterday seemed to have brought some stability to the Bitcoin Market.  Souce: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#charts As per Coin Market Cap, Bitcoin is currently trading above $6,500 as its volatility diminishes. It seems Bitcoin has found its footing once more, as it has regained some of its strength from plummeting this past weekend as its rival Bitcoin Cash surged. It is still below $1,300 from last week’s all-time records. CME first made their announcement towards the end of October and there was speculation that it was responsible for the bullish surge of BTC up until late last week. Duffy states that he plans to offer a risk assessment area for Wall Street institutional traders.  He told CNBC, “I’m not trying to rein in the volatility of Bitcoin but what I want to do is give it a place for other people to lay out that risk. Today you cannot short Bitcoin. So there’s only one way it can go.” Bitcoin, at press time, is currently trading at $6636.86 up 2% in 24hrs. Featured Image: twitter",14-Nov,2017
" A state-owned electric utility in China is rebuffing rumors that bitcoin mining has been deemed illegal by the government. However, some are still fearful there will be a ban on Bitcoin mining. Rumours spread in the past day – based on circulated document- revealing that the country’s State Grid was moving to ban bitcoin mining at a country level in the Sichuan province, an ostensibly notable development given the area’s abundant water supply for electricity generation and the fact that profit-chasing bitcoin miners are headquartered in the region. A translated document states that “bitcoin mining is an illegal activity. Each State Grid connected generator that is involved in powering Bitcoin mining is also regarded as an illegal practice, which shall prohibited.” The document was quickly circulated and reported by Chinese local media which raised questions about whether such a decision may signal an administrative move against bitcoin mining. According to Chinese business publication Caixin, local executives from the country branch confirmed the authenticity of the report but clarified it’s only an internal memo and some of the phrases were drafted incorrectly. Further, the document comes from a country branch instead of a statewide level, thus diminishing the weight it might carry. Featured Image: twitter",14-Nov,2017
" Yesterday, at around 4PM EDT on block 504,031, the Bitcoin Cash Network (BCH) completed a successful hard fork. The new software that was initiated yesterday is specifically geared towards the rules of reward distribution and it was aimed at making it more attractive to the miner that secure this blockchain. Currently, the new version of the blockchain has assembled six blocks, while there has been zero mining on the older Bitcoin Cash network. Like any potential hard fork complication, with zero mining on the old blockchain they’ve successfully avoided a competing cryptocurrency being built. Yesterday’s hard fork switched a protocol to an alternative mining algorithm that will positively adjust how difficult it is for the miners to create new blocks on the blockchain, increasing it to every 600 seconds. The reason the BCH developers decided to initiate this, is a large number of miners have been switching frequently between mining Bitcoin and the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, shifting to whichever blockchain is offering the most rewards at that given time.  Many of the BCH supporters believe this is now going to “level” the playing field and should be fair without any miners gaming the system. What didn’t change with this network is their 8MB block size, that is what started this alternative cryptocurrency that was hard forked off the Bitcoin blockchain back in August.  The urgent need for this mining change had many developers believing this upgrade would run smoothly and without contention.  Earlier this week in various Bitcoin Cash specific cryptocurrency channels, major mining pool operators expressed their support for these upgrades. The mining algorithm had been producing wild fluctuations in hash rate and the upgrade aimed at fixing that. In the blog post specifically outlining this hard fork and its upgraded software, it detailed the current rule as “problematic because it prevents consistently fast confirmations for users, and radically shifts the coin issuance schedule.” Juan Garavaglia, a developer who coordinated the hard fork, wanted to stamp it as a success, indicating his optimism that all Bitcoin Cash networks will make the upgrade. If this new software upgrade lasts, it could mean great things for Bitcoin Cash.  The protocols have been strongly advocated as the planned hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain was suspended last week. Said hard fork, Segwit2x, was geared towards increasing bitcoin’s block size from 1MB to 2MB. With the suspended upgrade, Bitcoin supporters have been drifting to other alternatives. Starting its bullish climb Friday, Bitcoin Cash rose to a value of almost $2,500 Sunday, a record high. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin has dropped close to $1,000 in value, now sitting at $6588.37 from its previous record high on November 8th at $7515.68. Bitcoin’s value has not been this low since the end of October.

" Starting on Friday morning, Bitcoin’s price suffered yet another huge drop while it’s offshoot, Bitcoin Cash, soared up to at one point close to 50%, causing many to raise concerns about a potential Bitcoin death spiral. The Bitcoin Cash rally was so substantial that on Sunday, it briefly surpassed the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, with its total market value at $29.9 billion. Bitcoin’s price at its lowest this weekend saw a 29% drop but the most concerning figure calculated was its hash rate which fell at close to 50 percent. A hash rate is the amount of computational power committed to mining each digital coin.  Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/ A steep and drawn-out drop in the Bitcoin hash rate has the capability of setting off a much-feared “chain death spiral” that could leave the bitcoin network entirely useless. This specific metric is vital for a coin like bitcoin, particularly when its reason for dropping is directly correlated with a competitor taking its spotlight.  Bitcoin Cash reached record-breaking highs at almost $2,400 and it also depleted a lot of hash power from Bitcoin simultaneously.   How exactly does this death spiral work? The current Bitcoin network adds a new bundle of transactions, known as a “block,” at a rough estimate of every 10 minutes, or so. This exact time is measured by how long it takes for a miner to process this block of transactions. This, in its proper sequence, is then set by something called the “difficulty” on the bitcoin network. The difficulty automatically adjusts itself to match the hash rate so that the transactions won’t take too long to process. The difficulty is only adjusting every two weeks. If the hash rate unexpectedly plummets this difficulty could be interpreted too high for the quantity of processing power of the network. If this occurs, it could mean major delays in the completion of Bitcoin transactions. Over the weekend, the spiral was mentioned throughout the cryptocurrency community with it on the edge of a disastrous failure. Said spiral starts when transactions are delayed and the network’s utility gets reduced. Its investors decide to stop “dumping” coins causing a sharp price drop. Miners, then begin mining other coins due to the network delay and the lower price of the cryptocurrency, which makes mining less profitable. The cycle would continue, with both miners and investors completely abandoning the coin, creating long delays in transactions times and preventing the “difficulty” adjustment from occurring to “break” the vicious cycle.  Peter Kim, a co-founder of a developer tool named Nitrous described the cycle as, “Transactions get backlogged to a point where the coin becomes basically useless.” Think that this scenario seems a bit far-fetched? Over the weekend, it came extremely close to happening. As everyone’s eyes were glued to the price of Bitcoin, they weren’t looking at the bigger picture.  Source: https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate Over a two day period, Bitcoin’s hash rate fell 50 percent as miners switched from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash because of the profit, as shown in the graph above. This drop indicated that the transaction times on the bitcoin network doubled, from 10 minutes to about 20 minutes or more.  A Bitcoin Analyst, Jimmy Song, explained why Bitcoin Cash suddenly became so attractive to miners. He said, “Bitcoin Cash was up to 100 percent more profitable to mine because of the price run-up. When it’s more profitable to mine Bitcoin Cash, miners will go there. When it’s more profitable to mine Bitcoin like right now, miners will go there.” Bitcoin Cash’s own mining difficulty increases ironically saved Bitcoin and halted the death spiral.  The algorithm governing its adjustments generated the rise in its difficulty, making Bitcoin Cash less profitable to mine.  Bitcoin Cash’s developers didn’t want volatile hash rates within their cryptocurrency, so they adjusted their difficulty adjustment rules on November 13th by way of a hard fork, but it was too late. By the time they initiated the upgrades, many of the miners had already switched back to bitcoin. According to fork.lol and the graph above, Bitcoin has gained about 20 percentage points from where it was at before the drop and the death spiral has been avoided.

" Bitcoin Classic this week announced on its website it is officially shutting down, and they credit themselves for the current bullish traction of Bitcoin Cash. The developers of “classic” claim Bitcoin Cash (BCH) will become new Bitcoin by May of 2018.  Tom Zander praised Bitcoin Cash in the statement claiming its validity meant that Bitcoin Classic “fulfilled its promise.” He also said, “It is now up to you which chain will gain the most traction. It is now up to the next billion people to start to use Bitcoin Cash. In at most six months I’m sure we’ll just drop the ‘Cash’ and call it ‘Bitcoin.’” At the time of reporting, Bitcoin Cash has shot up in price over 49 percent at $943.49, in the last 24 hours. This is its highest value since its debut back in mid-August.  Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/ Funds seem to be flowing into the Bitcoin rival, after the highly anticipated Bitcoin network upgrade, SegWit2x, was shut down on Wednesday. This sudden halt was due to the decline in support from its developing team and fear of a potential blockchain split, thus creating another Bitcoin rival. Zander had some words to say about the decision of Bitcoin to not go ahead with the upgrade stating, “The fact that the Legacy chain is stuck at 1 MB, and likely always will be, confirms the Cash chain’s viability. Now the market will decide.”  Before the news of this upcoming hard fork, Bitcoin Cash had been stagnant. Now, there is much support pouring in from public and investors, as its price has skyrocketed. Featured Image: Depositphotos/© spaxiax",10-Nov,2017
" Bitcoin’s investors are losing confidence as its price continues to drop past 5% at $6773.29 in just 24 hrs and its lowest, since November 1st. Traders have begun to bet on the coin’s ‘offshoot’, Bitcoin Cash, which split from its original version back in August. 
  Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/ Analysts say the surge is down due to developers pulling the plug on SegWit2x, a planned upgrade aimed at improving transaction speed on the network. The Director of the CFD Broker XTB, Joshua Raymond, told Business Insider: “The delay to Segwit2x has damaged confidence amongst bitcoin investors concerning the much-needed resolution to speed up bitcoin’s slow processing speed. Everyone was hoping the Segwit2x would address this but unfortunately, the delay due to a lack of consensus on the mechanics has affected confidence. Confidence in transaction speed in Bitcoin has deteriorated significantly in recent months. As Bitcoin Cash enjoys much faster transaction speeds, we have started to see a recycling of positions out of Bitcoin into Bitcoin Cash as a consequence.” Bitcoin Cash was initiated by way of a “fork” which splits the blockchain record, creating a completely new network. The incentive behind developers jumping ship to the new coin is that it allows for larger “blocks” to be processed, which makes the network much faster.  While the new SegWit2x upgrade had intentions of speeding up the original blockchain, many developers originally backed it and then began falling off close to its deadline. The hard fork also posed the risk of the network being split again, thus creating more competition. An Analyst from the trading platform eToro, said, “After the 2x hard fork was called off, BCH is now being seen as a favorite to one day replace BTC. If the community doesn’t come to a consensus about how to scale the network soon, it may run into congestion, in which case people will need an alternative.”  Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/#charts As developers scramble to come up with a reasonable solution to their slow network problem, Bitcoin Cash continues to rise. It seems some traders have jumped ship because, in just the last 24 hours alone, the off-shoot currency’s price has risen over 35% at $855.43. However, the original cryptocurrency has bounced back from adversity in the past, the digital currency’s price is up seven times what it was at the beginning of 2017. By the end of this year, the world’s largest futures exchange, CME, is launching Bitcoin futures, another positive step in the longevity of the cryptocurrency.

" Many big-name figures in the financial industry have been publically criticizing Bitcoin lately, reporting it as a “bubble.” JPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Morgan is the most noted critic of the original digital currency.  Yet, because of its transparent and its mathematical and decentralized character, calling it a bubble of any kind is highly inaccurate. Back in 2013, there was a Bitcoin bubble per se, when the demand for Bitcoin rose to a point where it could no longer be fully supported by the market and dropped from $1,300 to $200. Calling it a “bubble”, however, is still an inaccurate description, just like it’s inaccurate to describe Tesla and Amazon in the same way. Up until the end of this Spring, analysts continued to describe Tesla’s value increase as a bubble, as they did Amazon throughout its 20 years of business. The transportation editor of Business Insider a few months ago made a statement about Tesla saying, “At this point, a Tesla bubble looks obvious and it looks as obvious as it has since early this year. The difference now is that it’s grown so large that it’s become terrifying.” Any emerging company, startup, or technology that has an accelerated increase in their value or growth is now being seen by experts, as “bubbles.” With many major corrections from 2013 to 2017, Tesla’s price has increased from around $20 to $302. Since its beginning, Tesla has recovered from several setbacks and developed a stable sustainable business and, more importantly, a consumer base extremely similar to how Bitcoin evolved into a viable financial network and captured active user bases of tens of millions of people. Furthermore, Bitcoin has significantly matured since its launch in 2009. Apple’s co-founder and Billionaire Steve Wozniak recently described Bitcoin as more legitimate and transparent than “most systems in existence today.” In his interview with Money 2020 he stated: ”There is a certain finite amount of Bitcoin that can ever exist. Gold gets mined and mined and mined. Maybe there’s a finite amount of gold in the world, but Bitcoin is even more mathematical and regulated and nobody can change mathematics.” Featured Image: twitter",10-Nov,2017
" The next generation of investors has spoken. A survey recently held online by Harris Poll uncovered that more than 1 in 4 millennials prefer ditching stocks for Bitcoin. The results were based on more than 2,000 adults participating, that were over the age of 18 during October of 2017. Bitcoin and the additional cryptocurrencies are perfectly suitable to the millennial mindset, as most are fed up with traditional banking and the dominion of old money and traditional investing. Investing in millennials has taken a shift toward digital currencies. It’s not just stocks that many millennials favor Bitcoin over, it’s other traditional financial assets as well. The survey question asked: Comparing Bitcoin to other forms of financial assets, would you prefer to own $1,000 worth of Bitcoin or $1,000 worth of (stocks, government bonds, real estate, gold)? Yes/No (Yes answers represented as percentages in the chart below)  Source: http://www.survey.blockchain.capital/ Nonetheless, the survey also showed that only 4% of this generation actually own or have owned bitcoin, while they prefer it over the traditional methods they are reluctant to pull the trigger. For the older generations who have always trusted in bonds and stocks, it’s easy to understand why their interest in the digital currency is smaller. As cryptocurrency is more widely adopted and becomes more mainstream, there will most likely be an interest shift. For most millennials ‘mainstream’ isn’t cool and that is most likely a big reason as to why Bitcoin is popular among the specific age group. While I’m sure it may seem mainstream for those in the cryptocurrency space, there is still a long way to go. Wall Street has started entering the digital currency world, with EFTs and futures starting to look more and more like a reality. The target audience will definitely be the younger generation but with their hand in it, interest might spread across the various generations. Featured Image: forbes",9-Nov,2017
" The highly controversial hard fork anticipated to take place a few days from now on the Bitcoin blockchain has been suspended. The upgrade, named SegWit2x, was aimed at increasing block size. Early on there was strong support for the from Bitcoin startups and mining pools. The upgrade was anticipated to happen on November 16th and occurring on block 494,784. 2x’s goal was to increase bitcoin’s transaction capacity, which is currently held back by the nature of the current software’s rules. This halt in the upgrade was announced to the public today via email from BitGo’s CEO Mike Belshe. He was one of the main leaders of the Segwit2x project. He wrote: “Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean block size upgrade at this time. Continuing on the current path could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin’s growth. This was never the goal of Segwit2x. Until then, we are suspending our plans for the upcoming 2MB upgrade.” Due to this halt, the price of Bitcoin hit another record high of $7,848.31 according to CoinDesk. Although, by the afternoon it hit a session low of $7,078.96.  Source: Coindesk.com As fees continue to rise in Bitcoin Transactions, the developers are hoping the community can come together for a solution to this problem.

" By now, most people have heard of the term ‘Bitcoin’. But do you know why this digital currency is garnering national attention? It’s because bitcoin is a huge deal. Some have even gone as far as calling it ‘gold 2.0’.  And why shouldn’t they? Bitcoin is one of the biggest trends our generation has ever seen. It’s certainly one of the most important inventions since the internet.   Don’t believe me? Just ask Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, or Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group.  Branson has said that there is a massive industry surrounding the digital currency, and “people have made fortunes out of bitcoin.”  Gates believes bitcoin is exciting because it shows just how cheap it can be. “Bitcoin is better than currency because you don’t have to physically be in the same place.” What does Gates mean when he says one doesn’t have to be in the same place? Well, here’s where things really start to get interesting: There is no such thing as a bitcoin company or building. In fact, there isn’t even a bitcoin server to shut down even if one wanted too. Bitcoin is completely distributed and that’s what makes it so unique.  It’s a way to exchange value online without a third-party intermediary. While it’s true bitcoin might endure a few ups and downs – like any other emerging technology – bitcoin still appears to be here to stay. In fact, there are a few who believe that one bitcoin could be worth between half a million dollars and a million dollars in 10 years time. So, the question that remains is: is bitcoin the currency of the future? It certainly seems that way. Some have even suggested that the black chain encryption behind bitcoin has the ability to bring the world out of poverty. So what are you waiting for? Get out there and do some research; build yourself a bitcoin wallet and learn about all the ways in which this is going to improve the lives of people on this planet because bitcoin truly is one of the most important inventions of humankind.

" Bitcoin catapulted past $7,400 on Friday morning, rising almost 6% and breaking its previous record the day before of almost $7,000. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value has seen a steady bull trend since Wednesday when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world’s largest derivatives trading house by volume, announced that they will launch trading for Bitcoin futures, before the end of this year. Analysts believe more institutional investors could potentially warm up to the digital token after Wednesday’s announcement.  Charles Hayter, Ceo of Crypto Compare told CNBC in an email: “This is bitcoin crossing the divide from the wild west of finance to the mainstream. Futures from an incumbent exchange bring bitcoin and cryptocurrencies into the regulatory fold. This allows more complex financial products to be created and will eventually open the doors to institutional money.” This skyrocketed movement following CME’s press release also saw the total value of all of all cryptocurrencies climb to over $200 billion, a new record high. The market cap of Bitcoin, being the most valued cryptocurrency by a wide margin, takes up most of the overall value sitting just at $124 billion. The price of Bitcoin has risen 640 percent since the beginning of 2017.  CNBC reported on Wednesday of this week that Amazon, the e-commerce giant, secured three new domain names in relation to cryptocurrency. The three new domain names they bought were: amazonethereum.com, amazoncryptocurrency.com, and amazoncryptocurrencies.com. Amazon already owned the domain name of amazonbitcoin.com but the VP of Amazon Pay, Patrick Gauthier, told CNBC when they inquired about this very thing last month, that Amazon has no plans on accepting cryptocurrency, as there is not any current demand. As for the buying of the domain names currently, it’s likely due to them just securing the sites to protect their brand name as cryptocurrency continues to grow. On many occasions companies buy various domains surrounded by their name to secure their brand. However, with how competitive Amazon has become on crushing their opponents, their shift into the cryptocurrency space is inevitable. Bitcoin has a higher market cap than major companies like Nike and American Express. As more and more businesses start accepting Bitcoin as well as other digital currencies, their hand will be forced in order to keep their monstrous market share intact. Bitcoin is being faced with another hard “fork” in its blockchain scheduled to occur later this month. Currently, its investors and miners, volunteers who process the transactions and add them to the blockchain, are currently split on the movement of the asset. The mining of the Bitcoin blockchain is a long procedure and a group of developers is brainstorming ways to speed up the mining process. Bitcoin has already endured two forks earlier this year, and new cryptocurrencies emerged because of them. Bitcoin Cash was created in August and just last month, another hard fork created Bitcoin Gold. There have been a number of critics recently that have expressed their doubts on cryptocurrency. On Thursday during a press conference, the New York Times reported that Tidjane Thiam, the CEO of Credit Suisse, stated that bitcoin was the “very definition of a bubble.” Credit Suisse, happens to be the second largest bank in Switzerland. In a note this morning, Oliver White, an economist at Fathom Financial Consulting, stated that as an asset, Bitcoin was “intrinsically worthless.” “Bitcoin fans will doubtless argue that it’s no different from fiat money in this respect. But that’s to do a disservice to notes and coin, in our view. Notes and coin have government backing,” White states. On the other hand, Business Insider released a video on October 19th interviewing one of Wall Street’s top strategist on his predictions of Bitcoin.  Tom Lee, Co-Founder of FundStrat Global Advisor, described in this interview his different methodologies in valuing Bitcoin. Lee has over 25 years experience in Wall Street equity research and every year since 1998, has been top-ranked by Institutional Investor. He projected Bitcoin’s value by the middle of 2018 to reach $6,000 but due to recent events, it has far surpassed his projected numbers. His long-term projection was bitcoin would reach $25,000 by 2020. You can view the full interview below:  Featured Image: depositphotos/spaxiax",3-Nov,2017
" Many are wondering, ‘is bitcoin just a bubble?.”  Tidjane Thiam, the Chief Executive Officer of Switzerland’s second-largest bank, Credit Suisse, has made his position known on the issue. The New York Times reports that the banking chief called Bitcoin’s anonymity a major “challenge” before saying, “From what we can identify, the only reason today to buy or sell Bitcoin is to make money, which is the very definition of speculation and the very definition of a bubble.” Bitcoin reached a record high of $7,000, which happens to be seven times its value from the beginning of 2017. Other big bankers have similar views to Thiam’s, JPMorgan Chase & Co’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, recently called Bitcoin a “fraud” that will eventually implode. Of the most notable to comment on this “bubble” theory was the one and only billionaire investor Warren Buffett.  Criminal use of the cryptocurrency and their belief of criminals being able to hide their activities with its anonymity, is another big potential drawback bankers see from the cryptocurrency and its blockchain.  Thiam said, “Most banks in the current state of regulation have little or no appetite to get involved in a currency which has such anti-money laundering challenges,” Bitcoin’s new high has been all over the news, Thiam adds that he still expects interest in the world’s largest cryptocurrency to subside. Still, while bitcoin is being stiff-armed by most banking officials, banks are in a race to develop and implement blockchain technology in their systems. Featured Image: twitter",2-Nov,2017
" In order to protect themselves from cyber criminals known as “ransomware extortionists”, companies in the U.K have been increasing their positions in Bitcoin. This sudden interest in the cryptocurrency could have contributed to its recent rallies. This was what Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:$CTXS) CEO, Kirill Tatarinov said on Monday in response to TheStreet’s founder, Jim Cramer’s question at a panel discussing cybersecurity concerns at The Deal’s 2017 corporate governance conference. The issue at hand here are the ransomware attacks, and how various companies deal with such difficult situations. Ransomware is the act of cyber criminals hacking into a company sensitive information, and then demanding payment in Bitcoins to not destroy company data or networks. The WannaCry outbreak was such a case that cornered many companies, possibly fuelling the surge in Bitcoin value. It’s good to note that cyber criminals prefer payment in Bitcoins due to the untraceable and anonymous aspect of the currency. “We’ve seen people pay up after ransomware attacks,” said Tatarinov in an interview. “We’ve seen people who are proactively bulking up on bitcoin anticipating those attacks. We’ve seen companies proactively, we saw a couple examples in the U.K., where companies are proactively building up their Bitcoin to excesses so they can pay up. This is happening.” With over 400,000 companies, the twenty-eight-year old company that is Citrix Systems is a cloud service that provides secure digital workspaces, much like a very secure google drive, allowing users to securely access their work information from any device. The Ransomware attacks that made its rounds last month was supposedly the results of a weakness in the Windows operating system that was allegedly discovered by the U.S. National Security Agency. The information of the Windows weakness was posted by a group known as the “Shadow Brokers”. As such, with fear of a WannaCry repeat driving purchases by various U.K firms, consistent stockpiling may have something to do with Bitcoin’s surge in value from $1,692 on May 12, to its peaks of $2785 in June.  Although the value of Bitcoin has thought to have been derived from pure speculation, the reality that firms are stockpiling Bitcoin in order to pay off cyber criminals has suggested a legion of buyers that use Bitcoin for practical purposes. “Now I know why bitcoin went up so much,” – Jim Cramer, Founder of TheStreet Featured Image: depositphotos/merznatalia",6-Jun,2017
