" The past two sessions saw a lot of volatility and swing moves in bitcoin and altcoins. Tether drama sparked bearish moves in BTC and the price tumbled below the main USD 5,350 and USD 5,220 support levels. The price even declined below USD 5,000 and recently recovered above USD 5,200. Similarly, there were sharp declines in altcoins such as ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, EOS, litecoin, NEO, ADA and TRX. The market turned red and it may struggle in the near term. Total market capitalization  During the recent decline, bitcoin price  settled below the key uptrend support at USD 5,350. It opened the doors for more losses and the price declined below the USD 5,220 and USD 5,150 support levels. The price even dropped below USD 5,000 before staging a decent rebound above USD 5,150 and USD 5,200.
However, the price is likely to face a strong resistance near the USD 5,300 and USD 5,350 resistance levels in the near term. On the downside, the main supports are USD 5,150, USD 5,120 and USD 5,000. Ethereum price  extended losses and even broke the key USD 160 support level. ETH declined more than 5% and broke the USD 155 support as well. 
It traded close to the USD 150 support and recently recovered above USD 154. On the upside, there are many hurdles near the USD 158, USD 160 and USD 162 levels. If there is a fresh decline, the price could clear the USD 150 support level. Bitcoin cash price  extended losses below the USD 270 support and tested the USD 265 level. BCH/USD is currently down around 3% and it is testing the previous support (now resistance) at USD 270. The next key resistances are near the USD 275 and USD 278 levels. On the downside, a break below USD 265 might push the price towards USD 260.
EOS  declined and tested the USD 4.50 support level. It is currently recovering above USD 4.65, but it is likely to face a lot of offers near the USD 4.75 and USD 4.80 resistance levels.
Ripple price  declined heavily below the USD 0.300 and USD 0.292 support levels. XRP/USD even broke the USD 0.288 support and tested USD 0.285. It corrected higher recently, but facing resistance near USD 0.295 and USD 0.298. There was a sharp decline in the past two sessions and many small cap altcoins weakened by more than 8%, including NULS, BAT, MKR, R, WTC, ENJ, OMG, NANO, GNT, ORBS, ARK, WAVES and XTZ. Out of these, NULS is down around 12% and BAT declined nearly 11%. To sum up, bitcoin moved down sharply into a bearish zone. If BTC/USD struggles to move back above USD 5,350, there is a risk of a fresh decline below USD 5,150 in the coming sessions, and altcoins are likely to follow the same path.

" Recently, bitcoin price started a downside correction and traded below the USD 5,500 and USD 5,460 support levels. BTC/USD even broke the USD 5,400 level and traded close to USD 5,350. The price is currently (08:10 UTC) consolidating and seems to be struggling near the USD 5,400 level. Ethereum price too faced an increase in selling pressure and it recently tested the USD 160 support. Ripple was sold aggressively, resulting in a drop towards the USD 0.290 support area. Overall, the market is currently red and it could extend losses before it starts a decent rebound. Total market capitalization  There was an extended decline in bitcoin price  below the USD 5,400 support level. BTC/USD tested the USD 5,350 support and recently rebounded higher. However, the price seems to be facing a strong resistance near the USD 5,400 - USD 5,420 zone. The next key resistance is at USD 5,440, above which the price may revisit.
On the downside, the main support is at USD 5,350. If there are more losses, there is a risk of a drop towards the USD 5,260 support area in the near term. Ethereum price  managed to stay above the USD 160 support after yesterday’s decline. ETH/USD is currently consolidating and it seems like the price may test the USD 165 resistance in the near term.
However, if there is no break above the USD 165 resistance, the price may revisit the USD 160 support. Any further losses is likely to open the doors for more downsides towards the USD 150 support. Bitcoin cash price  found support near the USD 170 level and it is currently consolidating losses. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 280, above which the price is likely to recover towards the USD 292 or USD 295 resistance level. On the downside, the main supports are USD 272 and USD 270.
EOS  seems to be following a bearish path and it recently broke the USD 4.70 support level. The price tested the USD 4.55 level and it is currently down around 3%. If there are additional losses, the next stop for sellers could be USD 4.40.
Ripple price  extended decline and broke the USD 0.290 support level. XRP/USD even spiked below the USD 0.290 support and later rebounded above USD 0.292 and USD 0.294. On the upside, the main resistances are at USD 0.298 and USD 0.300. The past few hours saw additional weakness and many small cap altcoins dropped between 6% - 12%, including MXM, XTZ, DGD, BTS, PAI, INB, WAVES, DGTX, AE and GXC. Out of these, MXM is down around 11% and XTZ declined nearly 10%. To sum up, bitcoin is slightly under pressure near USD 5,400 and it could dip once again. However, there are many supports on the downside for BTC and it is likely to bounce back above USD 5,450 and USD 5,480 in the near term.

" Entrepreneur and Bitcoin bull John McAfee says he knows who the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, is and promises to tell - just not right now, the moment is not exactly right. Apparently, his “imminent” extradition request to the United States means his attorney believes revealing Nakamoto’s identity would currently be too dangerous for McAfee himself. “The US extradition request to the Bahamas is imminent. I met with Mario Gray, my extradition lawyer, and it is now clear <...> that releasing the identity of Satoshi at this time could influence the trial and risk my extradition. I cannot risk that. I'll wait,” McAfee wrote on Twitter. Additionally, he told Bloomberg that Satoshi is not thrilled about the outing: “I’ve spoken with him, and he is not a happy camper about my attempt to out him.”  Although very few in the community seem to believe him, they are still humoring him in order to debate the merits of having Satoshi’s true identity revealed to the public. “Wouldn’t this be a negative development? Unless [Satoshi Nakamoto] has passed away already…” tweets Tom Lee, another famous Bitcoin enthusiast and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors. “You've spoken well about the importance of privacy in the past, describing it as foundational to universal human rights. It's not clear how 'outing' Satoshi Nakamoto is consistent with those ideas, either for the individual concerned or in general,” adds A. Hannan Ismail, Senior Adviser for South-South and Triangular Cooperation at the United Nations. Additionally, many wonder how McAfee managed to unmask Nakamoto when so many before him failed. “People forget that I am a technologist,” he told Bloomberg. “I am one of the best.” But there is a silver lining: if what McAfee is claiming is true and he has indeed found Satoshi, at least McAfee additionally claims it’s not Craig Wright, commonly dubbed Faketoshi. The whole story was prompted by Wright serving legal papers to the individual behind the Twitter account @Hodlonaut and threatening to sue them for libel due to them calling him “Faketoshi” and a “fraud.” Partly in response to this, McAfee decided to go on a hunt for the real Satoshi. “My entire life I’ve been tracking people who are the best in the world, and hiding their identity,” he added. “Finding Satoshi was a piece of cake for me.”",2019-04-24
" Specialist blockchain and artificial intelligence investment firm Final Frontier announced that they were partnering with infrastructure provider for Bitcoin mining Bitfury to launch a Bitcoin mining fund, designed to give investors “convenient access to Bitcoin mining.” The fund is set to bring Bitcoin closer to mainstream adoption through providing investors with a way to participate in mining “in a confident and responsible manner,” according to Bitfury's executives.  The fund is in a European jurisdiction and is under the supervision of Liechtenstein’s financial regulator. Valery Vavilov, CEO of Bitfury, said in the press release, “With this innovative fund, Final Frontier is providing investors with a novel way of accessing Bitcoin mining opportunities, creating financial opportunities and furthering institutional adoption of Bitcoin.” The fund invests in turnkey assets comprised of mining sites with some of the lowest electricity and operating costs globally that feature state-of-the-art Bitfury datacenters, according to the announcement. The sites are scouted and operated by Bitfury, it added. A spokesperson from BitFury declined to comment on the size of the fund. “With the Bitcoin price down significantly from its all-time high, yet institutional interest growing every day, now may be an opportune time to consider investing in Bitcoin mining,” said Imraan Moola, co-founder of Switzerland-based Final Frontier.  The timing also goes hand in hand with the profitability of Bitcoin mining. Cryptocurrency analyst Alex Krüger said on Twitter that the current breakeven cost for Bitcoin mining is somewhere between USD 3,550 and USD 4,350, while the price of the asset is c. USD 5,500 as of the time of writing, which brings profits at above USD 1,000 per coin mined.  The bitcoin mining operational breakeven for efficient mining operations currently stands around $3550. pic.twitter.com/gQrNYBcvLH Bitfury Group was recently valued at USD 1 billion after it raised USD 80 million in a “private placement” investment in November 2018. The company also holds a minority stake in Final Frontier, as well as providing hardware and end-to-end services for the fund.  Institutionals are already looking into ways to enter the crypto space. One of the popular ways this year seems to be through endowments: a survey recently showed that out of 150 participants, 94% said that they have participated in crypto-related investment activities in the past year. Out of those, 54% invested directly, while the remainder had gone through a fund. Even major Ivy League university Harvard has dipped into crypto, according to reports, having invested directly into decentralized computing network Blockstack’s token sale.",2019-04-24
" Two-thirds of 10,000 surveyed Europeans believe cryptocurrencies will still be around in ten years’ time, but they’re less sure about Bitcoin itself, a new research by cryptocurrency exchange bitFlyer showed. However, barely a tenth of the respondents believe crypto will be used as a currency in the future.  The online survey, done through Google Surveys, included a total of 10,000 respondents, evenly spread over 10 European countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, and the UK. However, the profile of the respondents is unknown and it's not clear how many of the surveyed Europeans own cryptocurrency. In either case, respondents from Norway were the most optimistic ones, with 73% of respondents positive about the future of the industry, while 55% of respondents from France believe the same, putting the country at the bottom of the list. Still, this shows that in all the countries participating in the survey, the majority believes crypto is here to stay. The percentage of consumers who believe cryptocurrencies will still exist in 10 years’ time: In what form crypto will exist in a decade remains a mystery to most, as only 8% believe it will become a currency, while only 7% believe it will be used as an investment or security. Only Poles believe crypto might have more of a future as an investment or security than as a currency. The percentage of consumers who believe bitcoin will exist as an investment and security tool in 10 years’ time: Although the majority of respondents in each country believes crypto will be around in the future, the same optimism does not apply to Bitcoin itself. Italy is the most optimistic country on the list with 55% of respondents positive about Bitcoin’s future, while France is at the bottom with only 40%. A total of four countries are below the half line: France, UK, Belgium, and Denmark, while the others teeter close to the middle ground. The percentage of consumers who believe bitcoin will indeed exist in 10 years’ time: “The fact that Bitcoin is not generating as much support as other cryptocurrencies is in part a symptom of the market’s volatility, but is also a direct impact of the constant media attention that is associated to its volatility,"" Andy Bryant, COO at bitFlyer Europe, said, adding that this research shows there is much more to be done to demonstrate to consumers the benefits of and use cases across all cryptocurrencies more widely. “The next step is for the industry to better promote the benefits and use cases of cryptocurrencies to consumers, so that people understand how they will come to be used in society,” Bryant said.",2019-04-24
" Crypto researcher and analyst Willy Woo asked around in the crypto community what they think about the probability that the bottom is already in for this bear market. Taking all the answers he has into account, it seems that they believe there’s an average chance of 71.2% this is true. Meanwhile, a long-awaited golden cross appeared in Bitcoin charts, indicating the bull market. A total of 20 people responded to Woo’s survey, out of which two had notable comments picked out by Woo: one is trading veteran Peter Brandt, who said, “50% chance BTC goes to USD 50k. 25% chance we establish a very prolonged broad trading range for several years. 25% chance we go to basically zero,” and the other was Jesse Powell, co-founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, who said everything can go to zero at any time. The others make up an interesting list that is more or less bullish in nature: ________ As reported, New York-based research and consulting boutique specializing in the digital asset market Delphi Digital, claims that the Bitcoin bottom occurred in the first quarter this year, as there aren’t additional sellers coming.  Also, Adamant Capital has recently published a report on what could drive Bitcoin’s price going forward, regardless of the direction it might take. ""While lower prices are still possible, Bitcoin’s fundamentals are gaining momentum. Embraced by Millennials, its ecosystem is developing at rapid clip, both as a decentralized bottom-up disruptive technology, and as an uncorrelated, highly liquid financial asset for institutional portfolios around the world,"" the fund said. Today’s rally also seems to be indicating a possible upwards turn for the cryptocurrency as it has formed its first bullish golden cross since October 2015 - a candlestick pattern that is a bullish signal in which a relatively short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. It usually indicates a bull market and is reinforced by high trading volumes - which are at USD 16.3 billion as of the time of writing, while the price of BTC has increased around 5% in the past 24 hours and jumped above USD 5,500. Ladies & Gents... The Golden Cross! Bitcoin's 50-day moving average (gold) crossing above her 200-day moving average (blue). 📈This is yet another sign that we're back in a🐂market. 🚀🌛 pic.twitter.com/VK1PSsOYIB Others have different ideas, and economist and trader Alex Krüger is one of them: although he warns that his “maximum pain” scenario is not the most likely one: Maximum pain scenario for $BTC:- shoot through to $6000- rest right above $6000, luring longs in- dump back down to $4000s in 2 days- have everyone scream ""this is The End""- slowly move back up ""As Bitcoin edges back up, that previous USD 6,000 support level has now turned into resistance and is now firmly in the spotlight. A move back above here will bring the USD 10,000 level back in focus,"" added George McDonaugh, CEO of London listed digital asset investment company KR1.  However, he thinks that the most likely scenario is that Bitcoin will test USD 6,000, fail and head back down back towards USD 4,000.  ""I would expect the price to break through USD 6,000 on any second or third attempt and from there the aim would be to get back to USD 10,000,"" according to the CEO.",2019-04-23
" Yesterday, we discussed the chances of a fresh increase in bitcoin price above the USD 5,300 resistance. Today, BTC/USD gained bullish momentum and broke the key USD 5,350 and USD 5,400 resistance levels to start a strong upward move. The price even broke the USD 5,500 level and tested the USD 5,600 level. Ethereum price is also moving higher and it is currently (08:10 UTC) trading with a positive angle above the USD 174 level. On the other hand, ripple price is currently trading flat above the USD 0.322 support area, but it could start to climb higher in the near term. Total market capitalization  After forming a strong support above the USD 5,250 level, bitcoin price  climbed higher above the USD 5,400 and USD 5,500 resistance levels. BTC/USD is up more than 5% and it recently tested the USD 5,600 level. The price is currently correcting gains, but it remains well supported near USD 5,480, USD 5,450 and USD 5,420.
On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 5,560, above which the bulls are likely to push the price above the USD 5,600 resistance level in the near term. The next key barrier is near the USD 5,680 level. Ethereum price  is slowly moving higher and it recently formed a decent support base above the USD 170 level. ETH/USD is up more than 3% and it could continue to rise towards the USD 177 and USD 180 levels.
If there is an upside break above the USD 180 level, the price could surge towards the USD 190 level. On the downside, the main supports are near USD 170 level. Bitcoin cash price  followed BTC and jumped more than 5% above the USD 295 and USD 300 resistance levels. BCH/USD even spiked above the USD 305 level and it is currently consolidating gains. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 300, below which buyers are likely to defend the USD 295 support.
EOS  is moving higher and it recently broke the USD 5.25 and USD 5.30 resistance levels. The price is likely to test the USD 5.40 resistance, above which there are high chances of a rally above USD 5.50. On the downside, the key support is at USD 5.25.
Ripple price  seems to be forming a decent support near the USD 00.320 and USD 0.322 levels. XRP/USD must surpass the USD 0.328 and USD 0.330 levels to start a strong upward move in the coming sessions.     The recent bitcoin price rise boosted many small cap altcoins, including DGD, XTZ, ICX, AION, ADA, ELF, AOA, NULS, VEST and XVG. Out of these, DGD is up around 17% and XTZ climbed nearly 13%. Overall, bitcoin price is gaining bullish momentum and it could revisit the USD 5,600 and USD 5,700 levels. If there is a downside correction, buyers are likely to defend the USD 5,400 - USD 5,420 support area. Likewise, altcoins such as ethereum, bitcoin cash, EOS, ADA and BNB are likely to accelerate higher.

" After independent developers pushed cryptocurrencies closer to giants such as Twitter and Whatsapp, another company just built a bridge towards online retail giant Amazon and is targeting other e-commerce incumbents such as eBay and Ali Express. Moon, a crypto payment processing startup’s service, announced that Coinbase users can shop on Amazon buy paying with Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash via the Lightning Network technology. ""Soon you’ll be able to shop on any of your favorite e-commerce websites, like eBay, Ali Express and Target,"" the U.S.-based company said on its website. Until now, beta users utilized Moon to pay with crypto on e-commerce sites, and they were able to do so by connecting the browser extension to exchange accounts such as Coinbase. However, thanks to Moon’s lightning feature, now any lightning-enabled wallet can be used through Moon’s browser extension, the startup explained. The extension’s Lightning Network support is pending Chrome Web Store review, it added. The company further stated that there are no fees for purchases made via Moon, that the payments are instant, that all data is encrypted, and that it is not a custodial service. Moon manages payment channels and provides an interface for sending payments. Meanwhile, after installing the extension, users are required to make an account. While making a purchase, they will receive a QR code from the extension, along with the lightning invoice, and they can pay with their lightning wallet of their choice. The extension will recognize the checkout process, and users just need to click “Pay with Moon” to complete the purchase. Not all e-commerce sites will accept cryptocurrency, which is why, through Moon, users’ bitcoin is converted into fiat and then transferred to the sites, though it is still unclear which traditional financial institutions will be doing the actual conversion. Meanwhile, other third parties have also started bringing cryptocurrency closer to other giants. Developer Sergio Abril launched Tippin, a new app for Chrome and Firefox browsers in February 2019, which lets users tip a certain tweet with Bitcoin via the Lightning Network.  Furthermore, Wuabit, a Spain-based independent startup, aims to launch a limited public beta of its crypto wallet for the popular messaging app WhatsApp this month, where it will be available through the chat interface, but also for other messaging apps such as Telegram, Facebook Messenger, as well as SMS, as Wuabit co-founder and CEO/CTO Manuel Polo previously told Cryptonews.com.",2019-04-22
" This past week, bitcoin price climbed towards the USD 5,400 resistance level. Later, BTC/USD corrected lower and recently tested the USD 5,150 support area. The price remains well supported on the downside and it seems like the bulls are sighting a fresh upward move in the coming sessions. Similarly, there was a downside correction in ethereum below the USD 170 support, but the USD 165 level acted as a strong support. Ripple price also corrected lower, but the USD 0.315 level prevented losses and XRP/USD recovered above the USD 0.320 level. Total market capitalization  Recently, there was a downside correction below USD 5,250 and USD 5,200 in bitcoin price . BTC/USD traded close to the USD 5,150 support area, where buyers emerged. The price bounced back and it is currently (08:10 UTC) trading above the USD 5,200 and USD 5,225 levels. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the USD 5,280 and USD 5,300 levels.
A successful close above the USD 5,300 resistance is likely to open the doors for more gains above the USD 5,350 resistance level. The main weekly resistance is at USD 5,400, above which the price may accelerate towards the USD 5,550 or USD 5,600 zone. Ethereum price  also corrected lower below the USD 170 support level. However, ETH/USD found support near USD 165 and it recently bounced back to USD 170.
The bulls need to gain traction above the USD 170 and USD 172 levels for a decent rise towards the USD 180 weekly resistance. On the downside, the main supports are at USD 165 and USD 160. A daily close below USD 160 might put a lot of pressure on the bulls. Bitcoin cash  failed to retain gains and declined sharply below the USD 300 support level. BCH/USD even broke the USD 290 level and tested the USD 280 support. The price is currently consolidating and remains at a risk of more losses below USD 280.
EOS  declined sharply below the USD 5.20 and USD 5.00 support levels. The price traded close to the USD 4.90 level and recently bounced back above USD 5.10. On the upside, there are many hurdles for buyers near the USD 5.20 and USD 5.30 levels.
Ripple price  trimmed most its gains and declined from the USD 0.340 swing high. XRP/USD broke the USD 0.330 support and tested the main weekly support near the USD 0.314 and USD 0.315 levels. The price recently rebounded above USD 0.322 and it could face sellers near the USD 0.328 and USD 0.330 levels. Despite bearish moves in bitcoin and ethereum, a few small cap altcoins moved higher by more than 6%, including DGD, BIX, FCT, REP, SC, MCO and NANO. Out of these, DBD rallied close to 12% and BIX is up around 8%. Overall, bitcoin is still trading in an uptrend above the USD 5,150 and USD 5,100 support levels. Only a daily close below USD 5,000 might negate the current bullish bias. If not, there are chances of more upsides in BTC and altcoins in the near term.

" Bitcoin is in the last stage of this bear market, the accumulation phase, as we're back in ""undervalued territory,"" Adamant Capital, a Bitcoin alpha hedge fund, said in a report published today. It also provided six reasons why the price of the number one cryptocurrency might correct lower and listed three drivers that might increase the value of the coin. ""While  lower  prices  are  still  possible, Bitcoin’s fundamentals are gaining momentum. Embraced by Millennials, its ecosystem is developing at rapid clip, both as a decentralized bottom-up disruptive technology, and as an uncorrelated, highly liquid financial asset for institutional portfolios around the world,"" the fund said.  Adamant Capital was founded by Tuur Demeester, a popular economist and bitcoin-investor, who correctly predicted the crypto market drop last year. Now, they assert that the long term risk-reward ratio for Bitcoin is ""the most favorable of any liquid investment in the world.""  ""We expect for it to trade in a range of USD 3,000 to USD 6,500 after which we foresee the emergence of a new bull market,"" the report said, without providing estimations how long the accumulation phase may last. They added that this phase in the previous Bitcoin bear market lasted from February 2015 until May 2016 when when BTC traded in the USD 200 - USD 400 range. So what could possibly move Bitcoin? ""Given that no one exchange today has achieved the market dominance of Mt Gox at the time, a similar shock is unlikely. However, we still see exchange hacks or failures as the most important source of potential negative demand shocks for Bitcoin in the coming 6 months."" ""<...> we don’t see a financial crisis as a long term headwind for Bitcoin, on the contrary. <...> we believe that Bitcoin is of compelling value for investors looking to diversify their portfolios for protection against tail risks in both global bond and global stock markets."" ""Because of their large turnover and capacity to hold or sell coins, Bitcoin miners have an outsized influence on the boom-bust cycles of the industry."" ""Given the pending litigation it is unlikely but still possible that the Mt. Gox trustee begins distributing the 140,000 BTC that it currently has under man-agement. A significant percentage of this could then be sold by the claimants."" ""Historically [it] been a recurring fear factor in the Bitcoin space. However, we don’t think this is a  significant factor today."" ""<...> [It] should  be  considered  a  permanent  risk factor, given the disruptive nature of Bitcoin. Nevertheless, no serious pro-posals have been made in that regard.""
____ New solutions help Bitcoin to strengthen its positions as a lightweight, robust, and universally accessible protocol. ""As it matures, we expect for Bitcoin to disrupt the USD 100 trillion investment vertical of Liquid Store of Value, and become a globally used digital gold and reserve asset."" ""<...> surveys suggest that the majority of Bitcoin buyers are also Millennials, with mistrust of gov-ernments and growth outlook as the main motivations to buy. As the disposable income of Millennials continues to grow, we expect further tailwinds in terms of Bitcoin adoption and price appreciation.""
____ Also, Adamant Capital claims that supported by over 10 years of infrastructure development, the stage is set for mass market adoption in the coming 5 years.  ""In our assessment, during this phase (its “Windows moment”) Bitcoin will become widely recognized as a portfolio hedging instrument and reserve asset, and will begin making significant inroads as a payment network,"" they concluded. At pixel time (05:51 UTC), Bitcoin trades at c. USD 5,255, or 0.83% less than 24 hours ago.",2019-04-19
" Bitcoin recovery to its all-time high might take longer than Bitcoin bulls expect, an analyst at major Switzerland-headquartered international bank UBS warned, referring to historical charts of the previous asset bubbles.  ""Maybe crypto-bull contingents should consider what happens after the bubble - not every bubble that bursts recovers the old highs,"" Kevin Dennean wrote in his research note, according to Business Insider. Bitcoin reached its all-time high of almost USD 20,000 in December, 2017, but today, it’s 74% down from that number. According to the analyst, despite some Bitcoin bulls expect that the most popular cryptocurrency ""is ready to rise phoenix-like from the ashes just as other assets and indices did in the past"", it might take longer than many estimate.  Out of the examples Dennean gives in his note, all the asset classes (stocks, oil) collapsed by more than 75% from their peaks, except for one, but including Bitcoin, while only two recovered to previous levels. It is not easy to estimate how long it will take for Bitcoin to retrace its all-time highs, but presumably it will not be any time soon, according to Dennean: “We're struck by how long it took other asset bubbles to recover their peak levels (as long as 22 years for the Dow Jones Industrials) and how pedestrian the annualized returns from trough to recovery often are.” Decades later, some asset classes have still not recovered, the report said. Meanwhile, the crypto-Twitter has reacted enthusiastically to this news, not doubting Bitcoin’s recovering abilities, claiming that the analyst ""will be humbled"", according to Twitter user @mBTCPizpie. ""Make it 22 months!"" replies user @BTCradar. Others responded with good-natured humor to the idea of waiting several decades for Bitcoin to recover, posting memes - as people have come to expect, such as the “It’s been 84 years” Titanic meme, the “Ain’t nobody got time for that” meme, and a great many skeleton memes.   pic.twitter.com/6d9mF7Nn4Z Meanwhile, among the recent forecasters is trading veteran Peter Brandt, who correctly predicted the bear market of 2018, and now estimates that Bitcoin might reach USD 50,000 within the next two years.  Also, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of popular cryptocurrency trading platform BitMEX, has recently predicted that Bitcoin will more than double and reach USD 10,000 per coin this year. However, despite Bitcoin is up by almost 40% this year, Vinny Lingham, general partner at crypto fund Multicoin Capital and co-founder & CEO of Civic, an identity protection and management startup, said in April that the recent rally may very well be just another bounce before the next possible dip below USD 3,000.",2019-04-18
" Yesterday, we discussed a few important supports for bitcoin near USD 4,950 and USD 5,000. BTC remained well supported and recently climbed above the USD 5,100 and USD 5,140 resistance levels. The price even broke the USD 5,200 level and it is currently (08:10 UTC) correcting gains. Similarly, there was an upward move in ethereum above the USD 162 and USD 165 resistance levels. Ripple also rebounded and climbed back above the USD 0.320 resistance. Going forward, there could be a short term downside correction, but the crypto market is likely to bounce back.

Ethereum price  climbed higher after testing the USD 155 support. ETH recently broke the USD 163 and USD 165 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. It struggled to clear the USD 168 resistance and currently consolidating near USD 165.
On the downside, a break below the USD 165 support may push the price towards the USD 163 level. On the upside, the main hurdle for buyers is near the USD 170 level. Bitcoin cash price  climbed higher towards the USD 330 level recently and later retreated to USD 310. BCH/USD is trading in a range, with a strong support at USD 300. On the upside, there are many resistances near the USD 320 and USD 330 levels.
EOS  rebounded above the USD 5.40 level and tested the key resistance at USD 5.50 and USD 5.55, where sellers emerged. The price is moving lower towards the USD 5.40 and USD 5.35 support levels.
Ripple price  corrected higher and cleared the USD 0.315 and USD 0.320 resistance levels. XRP/USD even tested the USD 0.324 level and it is currently trading near the USD 0.321 level. On the downside, the key support is at USD 0.320, and resistance on the upside is near USD 0.324 and USD 0.325. In the past three sessions, many small cap altcoins recovered and climbed by more than 8%, including BIX, HOT, BAT, XTZ, WAX, CRO, KMD and NANO. Out of these, BIX is up around 13% and HOT climbed close to 12%. Clearly, the recent upward move in bitcoin pushed the price into a positive zone USD 5,140. BTC bulls now have to gain strength above USD 5,200 and USD 5,220 to push the price further higher towards the USD 5,320 level.

" A new alternate reality puzzle game has a thousand keys barring the way to USD 1 million in Bitcoin all over the world, prompting players to organize themselves into teams, not unlike the ones in popular young adult book Ready Player One, in order to lay their hands on the prize. (Updated on April 17, 07:18 UTC: section ""That was easy"" has been updated.) A cryptic message broadcasted to the Blockstream satellite on April 13th was the challenge for all would-be players to participate in “Satoshi’s Treasure,” described as a contest to “test the resolve, courage, intelligence, and savvy of would-be hunters.” Received a new message over @Blockstream Satellite. It appears to be a treasure hunt for $1,000,000 in #bitcoin, with included GPS coordinates for the first part of the hunt! 🤯🛰️🔎🗺️ https://t.co/M4mKMbQ8KU pic.twitter.com/HzkEJ8RFXc A total of 1,000 fragments of the private key are hidden around the world, and at least 400 of those are needed to move the funds. Players can team up, organize hunts, and even sell their key fragments - there are almost no rules, and the ones that do exist even come down to common sense. The rules promise that the keys will not be hidden inside private property, and that Hunters should under no circumstances enter those areas if they have not been invited. They will also not require any destruction of property, and should a Hunter consider destroying a Key to prevent others from finding it, the creator promises to reveal all the keys this Hunter holds to everyone, thus disqualifying them. A total of 20 people participated in creating the game. One of them is Eric Meltzer, co-founder of venture investment firm Primitive Ventures, who also donated part of the loot. He was joined by Ian Miers, co-creator of privacy coin Zcash, and 18 other unnamed contributors in creating the game - all in order to ensure that none of them know all of the locations of the loot. The rest of the loot was capped off by an anonymous angel investor. The first clue seems to point towards satellites: “These locations can be discovered by monitoring the output of the primitive orbitals known in your time as GALAXY18, EUTELSAT 113, TELSTAR 11N, and TELSTAR18V at 1PM EST, APRIL 14th in the year 2019,” the clue reads. It goes on to add, “This is not history's first great hunt, nor its last, but it is MINE, and so it is to me that you must prove yourself. I have devised a series of puzzles and challenges of increasing difficulty; they will test even the most resourceful hunter or clan.” ""The response [to the first clue] has been absolutely overwhelming. People showed up to the 10 spots we indicated around the world where keys would appear en masse—some drove over 3 hours to get to a spot. Others figured out how to brute force the encryption we used and solved the clues without having to travel (something which we hoped would happen, but thought would take weeks—in reality it took 30 minutes..),"" Meltzer said in the Proof of Work newsletter.  According to him, people are forming teams, talking strategy, speculating on the value of keys and where the next clues will show up: ""Subreddits are being created. Telegram groups are forming. Our poor mongoDB is getting hammered with signups."" Meanwhile, GitHub (a platform for software developers) user John Cantrell revealed how he obtained the first three key shards in a few minutes.  ""I was shocked! That was easy,"" he said at the end of the detailed and technical explanation. Other clues will be revealed at noon PST (UTC-8) on Sundays and anyone interested in participating is free to sign up for notifications. Meltzer told news publication CoinDesk that they’re also considering an app to help players keep track of everything, but that it will not be required to play. According to him, most of the participants are very young, and a number of them are minors. Happy hunting!",2019-04-16
" Yesterday, there was a fresh downside correction in bitcoin below the USD 5,050 and USD 5,000 support levels. However, the previous support near USD 4,950 acted as a strong buy zone once again. The price bounced back above USD 5,000 and it is currently (08:10 UTC) trading near USD 5,050. Similarly, ethereum and ripple extended losses and tested the USD 155 and USD 0.312 support respectively. Recently, both ETH and XRP recovered, but bulls seem to be facing a lot of hurdles on the upside. Total market capitalization  There was a downside extension in bitcoin price  below the USD 5,050 and USD 5,000 support levels. BTC dropped towards the key USD 4,950 support area, where bulls protected further declines. Later, the price rebounded above USD 5,000 and even tested the USD 5,050 level.
On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 5,100, above which the price is likely to struggle near USD 5,140. On the downside, the USD 5,000 and USD 4,950 supports are important, below which the price could decline to USD 4,860. Ethereum price  accelerated losses below the USD 160 support level and tested the next support at USD 155. ETH found strong bids and recently recovered above USD 160.
However, the price is facing many hurdles near the USD 163 and USD 165 levels. A successful close above the USD 165 level may perhaps open the doors for more gains above the USD 170 level. On the downside, the main support is at USD 155, followed by USD 150. Bitcoin cash price  rallied recently and broke the USD 300 and USD 310 resistance levels. The main reason was a sharp decline in bitcoin SV after a major cryptocurrency exchange, Binance confirmed that it will delist BSV. BCH may consolidate for some time before bulls attempt a push above the USD 320 level.
EOS  tested the USD 5.20 support recently and recovered above USD 5.30. The price needs to surpass the USD 5.40 resistance to revisit the USD 5.50 resistance area in the near term.
Ripple price  declined sharply below the USD 0.321 and USD 0.320 support levels. XRP/USD traded close to the USD 0.312 support level and recently recovered above the USD 0.320 level. On the upside, a break above USD 0.325 is required for an upside acceleration towards USD 0.330. In the past three sessions, many small cap altcoins trimmed gains and declined by more than 8%, including BSV, LAMB, KMD, HT, PAI, DGTX, WAX, IOST, LOOM and PIVX. Out of these, BSV is down around 21% and LAMB declined close to 16%. Overall, bitcoin price rebounded towards USD 5,050, but it must gain momentum above USD 5,100 and USD 5,120 to continue higher. If it fails to climb above USD 5,100, there is a risk of a fresh downside in BTC towards the USD 4,950 and USD 4,900 support levels in the coming sessions.

" The deadline for filing your tax returns is today, April 15th, if you’re a citizen of the United States - and while that’s always considered less than ideal news, it’s especially difficult if you trade cryptocurrencies, because the system is notoriously complicated - and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has never clarified their stance on six basic questions that every cryptocurrency owner wonders about.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has published a guidance on paying taxes on cryptocurrencies back in early 2014 and has not since updated anything, although the market has significantly evolved. For example, cryptocurrencies are not viewed as currencies at all, but as “intangible property,” similar to stocks.  Buying crypto with fiat is a non-taxable event, along with gifting the equivalent of USD 10,000 per recipient, or transferring coins between wallets. What is taxable, however, is the sale of crypto either for fiat or for other cryptocurrencies, exchanging it for a service (or, well, paying with it), mining, forks and airdrops, and receiving compensation in crypto (or being paid in it). For now, cryptocurrency traders have to track all their transactions that fulfill any of the above criteria and calculate the amount they owe the government. Additionally, airdrops are an especially difficult matter, as the US-based authorities have yet to agree on what they really are. Recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) implied that airdrops could constitute securities, although there is no monetary investment being made in them. They are also a sticking point for tax purposes, making up one of the six main questions that the IRS needs to answer to make the tax process simpler to follow. As Cryptonews.com recently reported, Washington-based crypto-focused research and advocacy institution Coin Center published a report with six basic questions not clearly addressed in the 2014 guidance. These include how to calculate the fair market value of cryptocurrencies, how to track cryptocurrency transactions they’ve made, and how people should treat airdrops and forks. The report also offers solutions to these problems, like letting cryptocurrency traders use tax lot reliefs that are available to stocks and some other securities, instead of having to go through the onerous task of tracking each transaction by hand and then calculating how much tax they owe on those.  Airdrops and forks are also addressed, as there is always a possibility that a user is simply unaware of even having received new tokens, and Coin Center proposes taxing them only when they’re being sold, instead of making them subject to taxation at the moment of receipt.  Although not paying taxes because you think, “What’s the worst that can happen?” is generally not advisable, it is a good idea to know exactly what might happen. If, by the end of April 15th, you don’t file your return or get approved for an extension, you will receive a penalty that generally starts at 5% of your unpaid taxes, according to American personal finance company Credit Karma. This is also the case if the IRS discovers you have underreported your income. The amount you owe also generates interest over time. According Credit Karma, “If you eventually file but it’s more than 60 days after the due date (either April 15 or the Oct. 15 extension deadline), there’s a minimum late filing penalty. For returns that were due this year, that penalty is USD 210 or an amount equal to 100% of the tax you owe - whichever is less.” The IRS remains tight-lipped on all things cryptocurrency, only recently tweeting that, “To avoid the late-filing penalty be sure to file an IRS return or request an extension, even if you can’t pay the full amount owed.” They have also not publicly replied to the Coin Center report yet, even though it was sent to them through 21 members of Congress, led by Representative Tom Emmer, who had also lent a hand to Coin Center in creating the report. In the official statement published by Rep. Emmer’s office, he says, “The 2014 guidance by the IRS failed to address fundamental tax questions, and repeated requests to the IRS for additional clarity have been made by a variety of entities. It also indicates that rather than providing clarity, the IRS has instead increased enforcement activities against taxpayers who ‘misreport’ their cryptocurrency transactions.” Moreover, Americans have lost billions trading cryptocurrencies last year, but they don’t seem to intend to report that, according toa survey, even though they could claim a deduction.",2019-04-15
" This past week, we saw a strong downside correction in bitcoin and altcoins such as ethereum, litecoin, ripple, cardano, EOS, and bitcoin cash. BTC/USD even broke the USD 5,000 support before buyers appeared near the USD 4,950 level. Later, the price formed a decent support near USD 4,980 and slowly rebounded above USD 5,050 and USD 5,100 resistances. The price even broke the USD 5,125 resistance and tested the USD 5,175 resistance. Similarly, there was a decent rebound in ethereum and ripple above the USD 165 and USD 0.320 resistance levels. However, there many hurdles for buyers on the upside and any further gains won’t be easy. Total market capitalization  There was a solid rebound in bitcoin price  above the USD 5,050 and USD 5,100 resistance levels. BTC/USD tested the USD 5,175 level and it is currently (08:10 UTC) trading in a tight range. On the upside, there is a crucial resistance formed near USD 5,200. If there is an upside break above USD 5,200, the price could test the key USD 5,400 weekly resistance.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 5,050, below which the price may perhaps test the USD 5,000 weekly support area. Ethereum price  formed a strong support near the USD 160 - USD 162 area. ETH/USD climbed above the USD 165 resistance and recently tested the USD 170 resistance.
Buyers need to clear the USD 170 and USD 172 resistance levels to start a fresh increase towards the USD 180 and USD 185 resistance levels. On the downside, a break below the USD 160 level may call for more losses in the near term. Bitcoin cash  gained bullish momentum and broke the USD 290 and USD 295 resistance levels. BCH/USD is up more than 8% and it even broke the USD 300 level. At the moment, the price is consolidating, with support near the USD 295 and USD 292 levels. On the upside, the key resistances are at USD 310 and USD 325.
EOS  jumped back above the USD 5.35 and USD 5.40 resistance levels. The price is up more than 4% and it recently broke the USD 5.50 resistance level. The next key resistance is at USD 5.60, above which the price may revisit the USD 5.80 weekly resistance.
Ripple price  recovered recently above the USD 0.315 and USD 0.320 resistance levels. XRP/USD even broke the USD 0.325 resistance before it faced sellers near USD 0.330. The price must clear the USD 0.330 and USD 0.332 levels for more gains in the near term. In the past three sessions, a few small cap altcoins moved higher and gained more than 8%, including XTZ, LAMB, MXM, INB, NULS, ZIL, WTC, REP and PIVX. Out of these, XTZ rallied close to 17% and LAMB is up around 15%. To sum up, bitcoin price rebounded above the USD 5,000, but it is still facing a couple of important resistances near USD 5,200. A successful close above USD 5,200 and USD 5,250 is a must for a fresh increase. If not, BTC is likely to decline back towards the USD 5,000 or USD 4,950 support.

" Yesterday, we saw signs of weakness in bitcoin and altcoins. BTC remained in a downward descend and broke the USD 5,240 and USD 5,120 support levels. Sellers even pushed the price below the USD 5,000 support area. It tested the USD 4,860 support area and recently recovered above USD 4,950. Ethereum too declined below the USD 174 and USD 170 support levels. ETH found support at USD 160 and it is currently (08:10 UTC) correcting higher. Ripple was under a lot of selling pressure and broke the USD 0.335 and USD 0.326 support levels. XRP is now trading below USD 0.320, with a bearish angle. Total market capitalization  There was an extended downside correction in bitcoin price  below the USD 5,300 and USD 5,200 support levels. BTC even broke the USD 5,000 and USD 4,950 support levels before buyers emerged near the USD 4,860 level. The price recovered recently above USD 4,950, but it seems be facing hurdles near USD 5,000 and USD 5,020.
A break above the USD 5,020 level might call for a test of the USD 5,075 resistance area. The next main resistance is at USD 5,180 and USD 5,200. On the downside, the USD 4,900 and USD 4,860 supports are very important, below which the price could move towards USD 4,500. Ethereum price  was under a lot of pressure and it declined after it broke the USD 170 support level. ETH even broke the USD 165 support and tested the USD 158 - USD 160 support area, where buyers emerged.
The price must stay above USD 158 - USD 160 to start a fresh increase. The price is currently correcting higher, but it could struggle to move above the key USD 170 resistance level in the near term. Bitcoin cash price  extended declines below the USD 280 support level. BCH/USD broke the USD 270 support level and even tested the USD 255 level. The price is currently recovering above USD 265, but it may face a strong resistance near the USD 275 and USD 280 levels.
EOS  nosedived below the USD 5.50 support level and traded close to the USD 5.00 support. It tested USD 5.05 and recovered above USD 5.25. The main resistance on the upside is near the USD 5.40 level, followed by USD 5.50.
Ripple price  reversed most its gains and broke the USD 0.332 and USD 0.330 support levels. XRP/USD even broke the USD 0.322 support and traded close to USD 0.313. The price remains in a bearish zone and it could test the USD 0.310 support. In the past three sessions, many small cap altcoins declined by more than 8%, including MXM, ABBC, KCS, ELA, MKR, BCD, HT, PAI, BTS, BSV, SNT, ONT, THETA and ZRX. Out of these, MXM is down around 11% and ABBC declined close to 10%. Overall, bitcoin price corrected sharply in the past three sessions and tested the key USD 4,900 and USD 4,860 support levels. BTC is likely to bounce back above USD 5,100, but if bulls fail to gain strength, there could be another drop towards USD 4,860 or USD  4,800 in the near term.

" The prices of most major cryptocurrencies have nosedived – hours after Bitcoin rose above the USD 5,400 mark. As April 11 drew to an end in North America – and April 12 got going in East Asia – prices that had earlier been displaying noticeable signs of weakness continued to fall apace. BTC had tumbled below the key USD 5,000 mark before rebounding later (03:18 UTC). Altcoins were also hit hard, with the likes of Ethereum and Ripple suffering – although some tokens have made slight rebounds from their initial falls. Top 10 coins by market capitalization:
(03:18 UTC) Analysts had previously been enthusing about the market, with one pointing out that BTC and Ethereum trading volumes were reaching levels unseen since the bubble of 2017. Crypto volume in that latest leg up was as high as in peak 2017 bubble https://t.co/atpFX8CLqF However, many believe that selling pressure became too high for many investors when BTC hit the USD 5,400 point, leading to rapid price drops. Meanwhile, as reported, according to Vinny Lingham, general partner at crypto fund Multicoin Capital and co-founder & CEO of Civic, an identity protection and management startup, the recent rally may very well be just another bounce before the next dip.  There was more bad news to end the week on for the South Korean crypto-community. Cryptonews.com earlier this week reported on the reversal of the so-called kimchi premium – a phenomenon in 2017 whereby South Korean traders were paying up to 50% more than the international average for their tokens. In recent months, optimism has returned to the market as South Korean prices fell – meaning many were paying 1-3% less than global averages.  But per data compiled by Hanguk Kyungjae, the “kimchi bonus” may have been very shortlived indeed. South Koreans are now paying an average of 1.8% more for cryptocurrencies than users of overseas exchanges like Binance and Bitfinex. The same media outlet was positive about the outlook, however, stating, “The domestic market has been revitalized.”  However, Chinese are also paying premium these days. Elsewhere in South Korea, Bithumb – one of the country’s largest exchanges – has released the results of an audit following an alleged “insider job” hack worth some USD 13 million, said to have been carried out by disgruntled former employees. The company says an external auditor confirmed that no customer funds were lost in the raid. The auditor also seems to be convinced that Bithumb’s usage of cold wallets for customer funds is satisfactory. However, the company has taken a significant financial hit. Earlier in the week, a financial audit of the company’s operator BTCKorea revealed that Bithumb experienced a net loss of some USD 180 million in 2018 – a huge drop from net gains of almost USD 470 million in 2017. There was a silver lining, though, with Bithumb revenues actually climbing by 18%. The company is currently downsizing in South Korea, cutting its staff from over 300 to nearly half that amount, although it appears keen to continue expansion efforts into overseas markets.",2019-04-12
" Yesterday, there were bullish moves in bitcoin above the USD 5,250 and USD 5,300 resistance levels. BTC/USD even traded above the USD 5,400 level and formed a new multi-month high near USD 5,420. Recently, there was a sharp downside correction and the price declined below the USD 5,300 and USD 5,200 levels. The price tested the USD 5,100 level and it is currently consolidating losses. Similarly, there was a downside correction in ethereum and ripple. ETH traded below the USD 175 support and XRP declined below the USD 0.340 support area. Total market capitalization  After bullish continuation above the USD 5,350 level, bitcoin price  faced a strong selling interest above the USD 5,400 level. A new yearly high was formed near USD 5,420 and recently the price corrected lower. It broke the USD 5,300 and USD 5,200 support levels. 
Buyers appeared near the USD 5,100 level and the price is currently trading near the USD 5,130 level. On the upside, the broken support at USD 5,200 may act as a resistance. On the downside, a break below the USD 5,100 level might push the price towards the key USD 5,000 support area. Ethereum price  declined sharply from well above the USD 180 level and broke the key USD 175 support. ETH is down more than 5% and it is trading below the USD 170 level.
An immediate support is at USD 165, below which there is a risk of a downside extension towards the USD 160 level. On the upside, the USD 175 level could act as a strong resistance. Bitcoin cash price  failed to stay above the USD 300 and declined heavily. BCH/USD broke the USD 285 and USD 280 support levels. The price is down around 7% and it seems like it could test the main support at USD 265 in the near term.
EOS  traded close to the USD 6.00 resistance and declined below the USD 5.80 and USD 5.70 support levels. The price tested the USD 5.50 support level and it remains at a risk of a downside extension towards the USD 5.35 level.
Ripple price  is down more than 5% and it broke the USD 0.345 and USD 0.340 support levels. XRP/USD is trading below the USD 0.338 level, with supports near the USD 0.332 and USD 0.330 levels. On the upside, the previous support at USD 0.340 may now act as a resistance. In the past two sessions, many small cap altcoins corrected lower by more than 8%, including IOST, NULS, LRC, REP, WTC, STRAT, PIVX, AION, STEEM, ARK, ZIL, TRX and PAI. Out of these, IOST, NULS, LRC, REP and WTC are down more than 10%. The current price action is slightly bearish and suggesting more downsides in bitcoin towards the USD 5,000 support level. Once the current correction is complete, BTC price is likely to rebound above USD 5,200 and USD 5,250 in the near term.

" China’s state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission, is seeking public opinions whether Bitcoin mining should be immediately banned, Reuters reported, citing the Commission. (Updates throughout the entire text.) Bitcoin mining has been included in a draft list of industrial activities the agency is seeking to stop, as they did not adhere to relevant laws and regulations, were unsafe, wasted resources or polluted the environment, the report said. The public can comment on the draft until  May 7. Chinese miners are major players in the Bitcoin mining industry. For example, at the time of writing, two largest mining pools - BTC.com and AntPool (both owned by Chinese mining hardware giant Bitmain) - hold almost 32% of the Bitcoin network hashrate, which essentially measures how much computing power is needed to maintain the network. Hashrate distribution If the new rules are enacted and Chinese miners will be forced to move to foreign countries, ""Bitcoin mining will no longer be dominated by China but become more decentralised,"" Michael Zhong, an analyst with Beijing-based cryptocurrency research firm TokenInsight, was quoted as saying by South China Morning Post. ""If this ban does end up happening its more likely to push BTC prices up than down. The loss of cheap Chinese electricity would raise the mining cost, which is net positive on price. It would also serve to kill the FUD that Bitcoin mining is centralized,"" Mati Greenspan, senior analyst at social trading platform eToro, tweeted. Following the news, Bitcoin is up by 0.29% in the past hour (07:16 UTC) and is down by 0.19% in the past 24 hours. The move by the Commission marks growing government pressure on the cryptocurrency sector. A year ago, articles from influential state-run media outlets signaled that further crackdowns could be launched to force out remaining cryptocurrency trading and mining activities from the country. However, until now, miners have shown a surprising resilience. Moreover, the upcoming rain season in China should once again bring low electricity prices revitalizing the crypto mining industry. Nonetheless, many of those mining companies were looking to relocate to more favorable locations overseas such as Iceland, Canada, and the US, to name a few. Also, there are concerns that China holds more influence over Bitcoin than many are ready to admit. China ""threatens the security, stability, and viability of Bitcoin” with its “political and economic control over domestic [cryptocurrency] activity, and control over its internet infrastructure,” a study, published in October 2018, from Princeton and Florida International Universities claimed. “If the Chinese government assumed control of domestic hash power, this property would grant them an advantage in selecting blocks for the ledger, which is important for some types of attacks,” according to the research. It defined four attack classes: censorship, deanonymization, weakening consensus, disruption to competing mining operations. In total, the academics identified 19 different attacks available to Chinese mining pools. ""In theory it's possible for a government to launch a 51% attack. If a government like the US or China decided they wanted to hurt Bitcoin, they could either rapidly shut down a lot of mining power so that they control a majority of what's left, or they could deploy new hashpower that takes over the network,"" Prof. Matthew Green of John Hopkins University told Cryptonews.com recently. However, he doesn't regard a 51% attack on Bitcoin as especially likely though, due to the enormous expense involved.  ""The thing to keep in mind is that 51% attacks, while they're terrible and undermine confidence, basically just allow double spending,"" says Green. ""This is really bad for merchants and exchanges, and in the long run it could make Bitcoin unusable. But it doesn't allow the attacker to, say, steal everyone's coins. And the cost of a rollback goes up as you go farther back in time.""
_____ Crypto Twitter: Yep. Sichuan, Yunnan, Inner Mongolia. ""China says it wants to eliminate bitcoin mining""#Bitcoin Fud pic.twitter.com/t11kNWD695 It just means that most of the hashpower will move across a border, some will go ""underground"" in China, tucked into backrooms of old factories. Cost of coin production might go up, but that doesn't affect coin price at all.",2019-04-09
" With the price of cryptocurrencies recently rallying, they’re also gaining more traction, and many more people are making transactions and thus spending transaction fees. Of course, due to the law of supply and demand, transaction fees get more expensive - but there are ways that you can make sure that you don’t overpay them, especially if you’re not in that much of a hurry. Transaction fees are included with your bitcoin transaction in order to have your transactions processed by a miner and confirmed by the Bitcoin network. Simply put, they’re payment to the miner for including your transaction into a block. Since there is only 1 MB of space for transactions within a single block, the more you are willing to pay - and thus outbid other users - the more likely you are to have your transaction picked up by a miner.  Of course, this means that there is a competition among users of the network to make sure their transactions are going through as soon as possible, even if it means overpaying. Bit Consultants, a Bitcoin education and consultancy organization, suggests that users are needlessly overpaying - more than would be strictly necessary to have your transaction included in the next block. However, you could be overpaying for transactions even if you’re not doing it on purpose: wallet developers are often incentivized to make their users pay the highest transaction fees in order to evade customers complaining about their transactions not going through. Fee calculations are horrible. Electrum suggesting 90 sat/byte with an almost empty mempool. So many people paying too much on fees. pic.twitter.com/0GSsyQuzIX Most cryptocurrency wallets have the option of adjusting the fee when sending a transaction, but there is a drawback: you risk having to wait longer for your transaction to be included in a block. “Spenders willing to wait a bit longer can still save money,” Bitcoin Optech, an organization that helps Bitcoin users and businesses integrate scaling technologies, wrote in a recent newsletter, adding, “For example, as of this writing [April 2nd], Bitcoin Core’s fee estimator suggests a fee of 0.00059060 BTC [USD 2.9] per 1,000 vbytes confirmation within 2 blocks but only 0.00002120 [USD 0.1] for confirmation within 50 blocks - saving over 95% for waiting up to an extra 8 hours.” However, the fee estimator still adds that, “Because of the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network and the fact that there is sometimes congestion in the available block space (because of the 1 MB limit), the amounts shown here are probabilistic and there are no guarantees that they will work.” All of these transactions are overpaying fees. Even at these levels next block fee is only 0.00003100 BTC ($0.15).Fees aren't high, the fee estimators are...1. Use wallets with custom fees, RBF, and CPFP2. Manually check mempool before each tx3. Optimize for next block. pic.twitter.com/axbUGbovwO Bit Consultants offers a simple solution: use wallets where you can set a manual fee amount, that support Replace-by-Fee (RBF) and Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) features. Replace-by-Fee is the replacement of an existing, unconfirmed transaction with a new one, identical except for the fee, which is usually higher to boost the chance of it being confirmed soon for when you can’t wait any longer.  Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) is a feature which allows the receiver of a transaction to spend the unconfirmed funds they are expecting. The reason this is helpful is because if you are waiting on a transaction that is stuck because the transaction fees are too low, you can simply send the unconfirmed funds to a different wallet address, with a higher transaction fee. The higher fee will have miners pick up the new transaction and the old as well, and both will be confirmed within the same block.  If you’re more tech savvy, Bit Consultants also recommends checking the mempool by yourself. The size of the mempool is the aggregate size of transactions waiting to be confirmed. If it does not have a very big backlog, there is simply no reason for you to pay more than the minimum - your transaction will get picked up simply because there are not enough other transactions to gain precedence.

" After Bitcoin broke through USD 5,000 last week, many believe that the crypto market might be out of its winter woods: investors are increasing their holdings, Chinese are buying bitcoin at premium, and a well known trading veteran forecasts bitcoin at USD 50,000 within the next two years. The founder of the blog Factor Research and Trading Peter Brandt, who correctly predicted the bear market of 2018, now draws parallels between two previous rallies.  “What’s happened from December of 2017 to 2018 is really an analog to what happened in the 2013 to 2015 bear market, where we saw sequential 10 up-and-down moves in the bear market and we’ve almost identically formed that same sort of pattern,” Brandt told news outlet Yahoo Finance, later adding, “I think the analogs are holding remarkably well and based on those analog studies, I think cryptos now will go back into a parabolic bull market."" Either from Dec '18 low or from retest of same (circa analog dbl bottom in 2015) it would not surprise me if $BTC enters a new parabolic phase. $btcusd pic.twitter.com/XV89Qz7P4n ""The only question I have is do we rally here some and then sometime in late summer check the late 2018 lows or not? There is a chance that it does, there’s a chance that it doesn’t,” Brandt added. Watch the whole interview with Peter Brandt: ___ Meanwhile, founder of the crypto hedge fund Ikigai Travis Kling tweeted about how they sent out a monthly update on April 1st only hours before the pump, where they mull the effect of reflexivity on crypto. “Reflexivity is the theory that a two-way feedback loop exists in which investors’ perceptions affect the market environment, which in turn changes investors perceptions.” Due to bullish news from the beginning of this year, they wrote, “risky whales may be throwing that bucket as we speak,” reversing the downward trend. Also, Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told news outlet Bloomberg, “An instrument that can go back to its 200-day [trading average] and hold it is now back in a bull trend. So I think sentiment has to change, because Bitcoin is now in a bull market.” Moreover, retail investors in China are also becoming more active in the crypto market.  “China is awakening again and buying at 5-10% premiums the past few days,"" Su Zhu, CEO of fund manager Three Arrows Capital, tweeted, also sharing insights by @cnLedger, a Twitter account following cryptocurrency and blockchain in China. It claims that ""We are witnessing a resurgence in Chinese demand for cryptocurrencies. This trend in the making comes after more than a year of relative quiet, a reminder of the time when Chinese volumes were king."" 2/ Why the USDT premium going up? After the PBoC ICO/exchange ban, the most convenient way to buy cryptos in China, is to buy stable coins like USDT first using OTC, and then trade it into any cryptos you want in exchanges. Meanwhile, in South Korea, it seems that the famous Kimchi Premium has been replaced by the ‘Korean Bonus’.

" The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is known for their undecided stance towards cryptocurrencies - other than the fact that they should be taxed, nothing else seems clear to U.S. residents that hold crypto assets. To answer six basic questions often asked by cryptocurrency holders in the US, crypto-focused research and advocacy institution Coin Center published a report with recommendations on what should be done to solve those problems. The IRS has published a guidance in early 2014 that has never been updated and does not answer the questions below. “Rather than targeting ‘unintentional tax cheats,’ we are hopeful that the IRS will adopt our common-sense recommendations,” writes James Foust, senior researcher at Coin Center, in a commentary accompanying the report. According to existing regulations, only “convertible virtual currency” is treated as property, and it is defined as “virtual currency that has an equivalent value in real currency, or that acts as a substitute for real currency” in the guidance, in Notice 2014-21. The guidance only concerns convertible virtual currency.  Although Bitcoin is considered convertible, it is unclear how, by definition, one should categorize other types of digital assets, “such as those having attached voting or payment rights or other contractual rights or obligations, algorithmic stablecoins, airline rewards miles, and video game currencies for which there are official fiat markets - e.g., Second Life’s Linden Dollars - as well as video game currencies that are not meant to be traded for fiat but for which secondary black markets nevertheless exist - e.g., World of Warcraft Gold,” Coin Center points out. Coin Center’s report urges the IRS to first clarify whether the distinction between convertible and non-convertible assets makes a difference for tax purposes, and, in case it does, to clarify whether non-convertibles are taxed and how. Also, clearer guidance on how to separate the two should be issued. If the distinction is non-consequential, then it should be noted that Notice 2014-21, as well as any others, applies to both. To calculate whether a transaction resulted in a gain or a loss to the taxpayer, they must take the fair market value (FMV) in USD realized from the exchange and subtract it from the adjusted basis in the property being sold; the basis is adjusted by various provisions of the tax code.  Now, to the question: how does one calculate the FMV? The guidance states that, “If a virtual currency is listed on an exchange and the exchange rate is established by market supply and demand, the fair market value of the virtual currency is determined by converting the virtual currency into U.S. dollars (or into another real currency which in turn can be converted into U.S. dollars) at the exchange rate, in a reasonable manner that is consistently applied.” However, most cryptocurrencies are listed across several exchanges and their prices on each can differ - which one should they choose? What does the IRS consider “a reasonable manner that is consistently applied”? Because of market volatility and often slow processing time at exchanges, which price should the taxpayer take into account? Coin Center proposes that taxpayers should be left to choose whether they use the exchange rate data from one exchange, averaged data from a set of exchanges, or a third-party exchange rate index, as long as they are consistent in their choice. However, they also note that the “reasonable manner consistently applied” should only be explained, and there would be no need for an additional solution. Buying Bitcoin differs from one day to another, let alone from one month or one quarter of the year to another. This means that the assets are also differently taxed, depending on when they were bought. The intuitive solution would be to keep track of every single transaction and calculate it based on the circumstances of the day they went through. Coin Center calls this task “incredibly onerous but technically feasible” for users that hold their own private keys - but for those using hosted wallets, it may be completely impossible. Stocks and some other securities have other, simpler ways of determining tax lot reliefs, but cryptocurrencies seem to not be eligible to use those. Coin Center recommends that the IRS changes this decision to include cryptocurrencies, letting taxpayers choose tax lot relief methods the same way other commonly traded financial instruments can, and/or adapting those to be applicable in the case of cryptocurrencies. Charity donations in the US are deductible from the taxpayer’s income for that year, and cryptocurrencies are no exception. The deduction is usually capped at USD 500, while donations that warrant a deduction of USD 5,000 or more have to be appraised. There is currently no way to have cryptocurrencies become an exception from appraisal, due to the fact that they are not considered cash. In this case, the recommendation is to have the IRS provide guidance explicitly allowing taxpayers to use exchange data to value cryptocurrency donations - the same way they would calculate the FMV of their transactions - instead of going through a costly appraisal process. Perhaps the most famous example of a hard fork was the creation of Bitcoin Cash in August 2017. Anyone who owned Bitcoin before the fork received an equivalent amount of Bitcoin Cash after it. This is the case with all forks that result in new chains being created. Airdrops are a similar feature: to each holder of a certain token, creators of a new token can choose to give them these new tokens corresponding to the amount of the original tokens they hold. The new tokens are not sold, but simply given away, to people who are known cryptocurrency users and already hold tokens, which are often in some way similar to the ones they are receiving now. In both cases, recipients may be completely unaware of the existence of the new tokens, especially if the fork or airdrop went by unnoticed and without media coverage. Even if they are aware, what if they do not sell or trade the new tokens? What if they never access them, regardless of being aware of them? The report suggests that the new tokens should not be taxed if the owner does not dispose of them. If they do, then the income should be recognized at the moment of disposition, not the moment of receipt or the owner becoming aware of their existence, as these would be too difficult to follow. However, if users hold their tokens at exchanges, anything the exchange decides to do with these new tokens should not affect the taxpayers unless it was done at their own direction. In Notice 2014-21, it is stated that crypto payments are subject to the same reporting requirements as “any other payments made in property.” Current regulations state that every taxpayer holding financial assets exceeding certain thresholds in foreign countries need to report this to a specific institution, according to circumstances. However, Coin Center claims, it is unclear whether holding cryptocurrencies on an exchange that is not located within the United States falls under this guideline or not. It is also not clear whether assets could be treated as foreign financial assets if a counterparty to the transaction is not a US person. As the solution to this problem, it is suggested that the IRS needs to clarify whether cryptocurrencies are subject to these reports or not - there would be no need for changing anything in the current regulations. Meanwhile, this week, Democratic senator Ron Wyden proposed a new version of capital gains tax, where investors would pay taxes on the assets they hold every year when those assets gain value, instead of just when they’re sold. Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania has called it a “breathtakingly terrible idea,” according to a report by CNBC, and people seem to agree wholeheartedly. This new version of the tax could kill a lot of markets, but the cryptocurrency market is especially vulnerable due to high volatility. However, the idea would be incredibly hard to implement - but it would throw yet another wrench into the already confusing idea of cryptocurrency taxes. “This tax proposal [...] adds enormous complexity to a code that is already mind-numbingly incomprehensible,” writes Ron Insana, senior analyst at CNBC. At the beginning of this year, Goldman Sachs-backed cryptocurrency company Circle that is also a member of a lobbying group named Blockchain Association revealed that they’re working with the IRS on clarifying, and even setting up, the rules surrounding crypto-to-crypto payments taxation. “We believe there should be different tax treatment for crypto-to-crypto, especially for smaller payments oriented transactions. The leading government on this issue right now is France, where they are soon passing a law where there will be zero taxes on crypto-to-crypto transactions,” The company’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, said at the time.",2019-04-05
" Volume on the peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins shows that developed market volume is tracking price, while emerging market volume has stabilized and keeps growing without regard to price. This would imply that developed markets are speculating, while emerging markets use Bitcoin for utility, according to investment firm Passport Capital. Although volume in both markets spiked in December 2017 when Bitcoin reached its all-time high of almost USD 20,000, in subsequent times, they followed vastly different directions. Bitcoin volume in developed markets kept falling until it reached a low not seen since January 2016, and then started climbing again, partially in time with the recent market rally. Meanwhile, volume in emerging markets fell much less and has stayed in the same bounds since the middle of the first half of 2018 - and the more time went by, the more it stabilized. At @PassportCapital we continue to observe a divergence between LocalBitcoins volume in Developed and Emerging Markets. Volume in Developed Markets is tracking price (speculation) while volume in Emerging Markets has stabilized and is growing despite price (utility ) pic.twitter.com/RuOtGCWa0X The data implies that traders from developed markets are speculating on the price and trying to make money off market volatility, while traders in emerging markets are using Bitcoin for utility. Part of the reason might be the fact that developed markets have no need for Bitcoin as a payments system due to a relatively stable fiat currency in place (USD, EUR, JPY, etc.), while emerging markets usually have a more volatile fiat currency, so they tend to try and evade using it, opting for alternative payment methods wherever they can.  One such example - and the most commonly cited one - is Venezuela, where hyperinflation hit 80,000% in 2018, rendering the bolivar close to worthless. Venezuelans have been increasingly turning to the use of cryptocurrencies throughout the country’s socio-economical and political crisis, and the motivations behind this were part of the debate between American economist Nouriel Roubini and smart contract platform Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin at the Deconomy Conference in Seoul on Thursday. Roubini, for example, maintains that the adoption of cryptocurrencies in Venezuela is an exception and shouldn’t be seen as the inception of a hard and fast rule. Buterin disagrees: in his opinion, Venezuela's case was “more to do with cryptocurrencies than fighting inflation. It's about looking for alternative means of protecting one’s assets.”  Venezuelan Bolívar to US Dollar Rates “Nouriel's main point of ‘trust the system’ falls apart the moment you take these ‘exceptional’ events into account. For they aren't as exceptional as mainstream economists claim. We have a war every 50 years. Families migrate every 100. Finance collapses every 10,” reacted Cornell professor Emin Gün Sirer in a tweet.  And while Venezuela’s hyperinflation is certainly currently unparalleled in the world, many countries - the vast majority of them, if not all, belonging to emerging markets - face similar issues due to weak economies, corrupt governments, or even stifling sanctions. In that case, a decentralized, electronic, peer-to-peer payments system is certainly a better option than what they currently have in place, in spite of the former’s volatility - in some cases, this volatility is negligible compared to the alternative, and even with volatility and regulatory uncertainty surrounding digital assets, the choice becomes one for the lesser of two evils. Meanwhile, people in the emerging markets, such as Africa and Asia are actually starting to use cryptocurrencies for transactions, Magdalena Golebiewska, head of Eastern Europe region at Luno, a Bitcoin company boasting two million global accounts, previously told Cryptonews.com. According to her, it is estimated that in 2025 up to 50% of global population will live in the emerging markets. However, the sharp dip that developed market volume experienced on LocalBitcoins does not necessarily have to be completely attributed to speculations - developed markets usually have much better access to centralized cryptocurrency exchanges that remove the dangers of peer-to-peer trading. However, there is no definitive data to separate the two motives.",2019-04-05

Marcus Swanepoel, chief executive of London-based bitcoin company Luno, also commented that ""what we’ve likely seen is that one large investor, probably institutional, bought quite a lot of crypto for their portfolio,” Financial Times reported (FT). However, Arca chief investment officer Jeff Dorman, a former trader for Lehman, Merrill and Citadel, told CNBC that even if buying by trading algorithms kicked off the euphoria, that would have reversed quickly if investors were eager to sell.  “Buyers outweighed sellers, and market makers felt the pressure so they took their markets higher, which triggered stop losses and liquidations, which added more buy pressure,” according to Dorman. George Harrap, chief executive officer at Bitspark, told Bloomberg he's putting ""most things on pause"" until the market settles down. While Dave Chapman, CEO of crypto exchange ANXONE, added that ""events such as today's will probably be seen negatively, or viewed as this market doesn't conform to the trading of traditional instruments."" However, Nigel Green, chief executive of consultancy deVere Group, told FT that this dramatic jump is not only likely to attract many investors who have been sitting on the sidelines, but might reignite institutional interest, also. Meanwhile, according to Dorman, the fact that every small dip has been bought immediately in the last few weeks shows that investors are not scared of sell-offs, they are hoping for them so they can buy more.  ""This certainly raises the near-term floor, but this sentiment can change on a dime too,"" he was quoted as saying by CNBC.

" This past week, bitcoin price started a decent upward move and broke the USD 4,000 and USD 4,070 resistance levels. BTC/USD even traded to a new monthly high above USD 4,120 before starting a downside correction. The price is currently (UTC 08:10 AM) trading above the USD 4,100 level, with key supports near USD 4,100 and USD 4,050. Similarly, ethereum price broke the key USD 140 resistance and revisited the USD 145 resistance. Ripple price rebounded and settled above the USD 0.308 and USD 0.310 resistance levels. XRP must surpass the USD 0.315 resistance level to reclaim the USD 0.320 level in the near term. Total market capitalization  After trading towards the USD 4,150 level, bitcoin price  started a downside correction. BTC/USD traded below the USD 4,100 support, but it found a strong support near USD 4,050. The price climbed higher again and it is currently trading above the USD 4,100 level.
An initial weekly resistance is at USD 4,150, above which the price may test the USD 4,200 resistance level. If there is a fresh decline below the USD 4,100 level, the price could test the USD 4,050 support. The main weekly support area is near the USD 4,000 level. Ethereum price  also followed a similar structure and it surged towards the USD 145 resistance after it broke the USD 142 resistance. Later, ETH/USD corrected lower and it is consolidating above USD 142.
The main weekly resistance is near the USD 145 level, followed by the USD 150 pivot. On the downside, a break below the USD 140 support may push the price towards the key weekly support at USD 135. Bitcoin cash  remained in a bullish zone above the USD 160 support. BCH/USD recently climbed above the USD 165 resistance and it seems like the price could retest the USD 170 resistance level. On the downside, the main supports are USD 165 and 162.
EOS  corrected lower and tested the USD 4.00 support area. The price rebounded recently above the USD 4.10 and USD 4.20 resistance levels. It is currently up more than 2% and it may revisit the USD 4.40 resistance area this week.
Ripple price  recovered after a dip below the USD 0.300 level. XRP/USD is trading above the USD 0.310 support and it seems to be facing a couple of important resistances near the USD 0.312 and USD 0.314 levels. On the downside, the main supports are USD 0.310 and USD 0.306. In the past three sessions, many small cap altcoins climbed higher and gained more than 8%, including TTC, IOST, ABBC, DASH, NANO, DGTX, BAT, NULS, LOOM and WTC. Out of these, TTC rallied close to 17% and IOST is up around 16%. Overall, bitcoin price is trading in a positive zone above the USD 4,100 and USD 4,060 support levels. On the upside, there are high chances of a fresh high above the USD 4,150 and USD 4,200 resistance levels in the coming days.

" In the past few sessions, there were mostly bullish moves in bitcoin price above the USD 4,000. BTC/USD traded above the USD 4,025 and USD 4,040 resistance levels. A fresh weekly high was formed, but the price failed to surpass the USD 4,060 - USD 4,070 resistance area. The current (UTC 08:00 AM) price action is positive and it seems like bulls could aim a break above the USD 4,060 - USD 4,070 resistance area. Similarly, ethereum is moving higher and it may attempt to clear the USD 140 resistance. Besides, ripple price is gaining bullish momentum above USD 0.307 and it may soon test the USD 0.310 or 0.312 resistance levels. Total market capitalization  After a minor downside correction, bitcoin price  found support near the USD 4,000 level. BCT/USD climbed higher once again and broke the USD 4,025 and USD 4,040 resistance levels. It even traded to a new weekly high above USD 4,050, but sellers protected the USD 4,060 - USD 4,070 resistance area.
The price is currently consolidating gains and if there is a downside correction, the USD 4,025 and USD 4,000 levels are likely to act as supports. On the upside, a convincing break above the USD 4,060 - USD 4,070 resistance area may perhaps clear the path for more upsides towards USD 4,100 and USD 4,150. Ethereum price  corrected lower and tested the key USD 136 support area. ETH/USD bounced back above the USD 138 resistance and it is currently moving higher.  
The price may perhaps test the USD 140 resistance in the near term. If buyers remain in control and clear the USD 140 resistance, ether buyers could aim the USD 145 and USD 148 resistance levels. Bitcoin cash price  resumed its upward move and traded above the USD 168 resistance. BCH/USD is currently up more than 1% and it seems like the price might accelerate above the USD 170 and USD 172 resistance levels in the near term. On the downside, the main support for buyers is near USD 165.
EOS  corrected a few points after a strong rally towards the USD 4.35 level. The price is currently trading near the USD 4.20 level, with the next key support near the USD 4.15 level. On the upside, there are hurdles near USD 4.30 and USD 4.35.
Ripple price  found support near the USD 0.305 level and later started a fresh upward move. XRP/USD traded above the USD 0.306 and USD 0.307 levels, with a bullish bias. On the upside, there is a strong resistance waiting near USD 0.310.  In the past two sessions, a few small cap altcoins climbed higher between 5%-12%, including KCS, BAT, AOA, XTZ, MXM, IOST, XEM and ELA. Out of these, KCS is up more than 12% and BAT is up close to 11%. Overall, bitcoin price is trading in a bullish zone above the USD 4,000 support level. If BTC/USD surpassed the USD 4,070 swing high, there could be solid gains in the coming sessions. In the mentioned case, altcoins such as ETH, XRP, BCH, WAN, ICX, EOS, ADA and TRX might also gain traction.

" The Bitcoin bottom has either already occurred or it’s happening now, at the end of Q1, as there aren’t additional sellers coming, according to New York-based research and consulting boutique specializing in the digital asset market Delphi Digital, who forecasted this scenario back in December. “It’s clear that there’s an increasingly smaller amount of coins that are being actively traded and sold, implying the incremental demand necessary for price to bottom also decreases,” the company wrote in a mid-March update to their clients, adding that there is the growing shift in overall bitcoin ownership mentality as individuals are set to hold bitcoin for the long term.  Yan Liberman, Co-Founder and Principal at Delphi Digital, confirmed to Cryptonews.com that this still remains the case at the end of March.  The paper sees strong hands in long term holders*, which have not sold in the past three months and are not expected to start doing so in the coming period. “Over that same time period [end of November to the end of January], we’ve noticed a decrease in 3-5 year holders from 9% to 8%, where it’s held flat. Aside from this slight decline, there hasn’t been much selling from long-term holders as BTC price remained in a consolidation period for much of the last three months,” the report said adding that the proportion of 2-3 year holders remains flat and low, implying theses individuals have mostly sold or are likely to continue to hold. The researchers estimate that even under conservative assumptions for lost coins, there isn't much potential selling that can come from long-term holders.  However, what could prompt 1-3 year holders to sell their coins in the coming months? According to Liberman, assuming Bitcoin doesn't get successfully attacked, it's likely that those individuals don't sell in the coming months unless: He goes on to explain that the first and second option are highly unlikely, while the third is difficult to predict, “because everyone has different breakeven prices.” “The 1-2 year holder group implies that you purchased between March 27th, 2017 and March 27, 2018. We actually have more granular data, and the mix of 12-18 month holders is larger than the 18-24 months. This implies that more of the 1-2 year holders purchased at a higher price point, thus their break-even is higher, and they're less likely to sell for a small price increase,” the Co-founder said.  Meanwhile, 2-3 year holders make up a very small amount of overall bitcoin ownership.  “They've all purchased this BTC at a significant discount to current prices, so if they haven't sold already, it's difficult to see what triggers them to sell in the next coming months,” Liberman concluded. The company estimates to extract more information from the 2-3 year holder band in June as the 1-2 year owners begin to shift over to become 2-3 year holders. $BTC UTXO age distribution animatedDec 2017 - March 2019data @unchainedcap pic.twitter.com/FQ2aeTV7gY Another thing that has the community worried about how the prices will behave is the halvening, set to happen in 2020, when the Bitcoin block mining reward will decrease from 12.5 to 6.25 bitcoins. As Cryptonews.com previously reported, the research team believes that this will be the last reward halving to have a very significant impact on price.  “The upcoming halvening in May 2020 also functions as an intermediate catalyst for a reduction in selling pressure. For reference, prices bottomed 542 days before the halvening in 2016. As of March 15th, we’re ~435 days away from the next expected halvening,” they added earlier this month. Also, in its mid-March report, Delphi Digital said that institutional capital wading into this market will eventually suppress crypto asset volatility, boosting bitcoin’s appeal as investors flock to safety, but they see this as a longer-term trend unlikely to materialize in the foreseeable future. They’re also discussing Bitcoin’s shifting narrative from a peer-to-peer currency to digital gold. Meanwhile, adoption of the Lightning Network will help enable those who prefer to use the digital currency as a peer to peer currency, Liberman said adding that he doesn’t believe that it'll change the general narrative. “It’s functional for different people in different ways. Those that can afford to treat it as a long term SoV [Store of Value] type of investment (developing nations) are doing that. At the same time, those individuals that don’t have the ability to save are also able to use it as a potential way to mitigate foreign currency risk (temporarily), a payments processor in areas that are unbanked or censored by the nation state, and as a method of transferring wealth when attempting to relocate,” the Co-founder said.
_______ * - Delphi Digital analyses UTXO (unspent transaction output) trends. UTXO stands for the unspent output from bitcoin transactions. Every transaction creates a new UTXO, and the age of the UTXO indicates the block that it was first included in. In other words, the UTXO age indicates the last time bitcoin was moved. Analyzing Bitcoin's aggregate UTXO age distribution over time provides insight into the buying and selling patterns of previous market cycles. This allows the company to forecast where we are in relation to prior cycles and what we can likely expect going forward.",2019-03-28
" Yesterday, there were solid bullish moves in bitcoin price above the USD 3,950 and USD 4,000 resistance levels. BTC/USD recently tested the USD 4,050 resistance and corrected lower. The price is currently (UTC 08:10 AM) consolidating in a range and dips remain supported near the USD 4,000 and USD 3,980. Similarly, ethereum price extended gains and tested the key USD 140 resistance. Later, ETH/USD corrected lower and it is currently trading near the USD 138 support. Ripple price traded close to the USD 0.310 resistance, where sellers emerged and later the price corrected lower below USD 0.308 and USD 0.306. Total market capitalization  There was an upside extension in bitcoin price  above the USD 4,000 resistance. BTC/USD traded above the USD 4,020 level and tested the USD 4,050 resistance level. However, buyers failed to gain strength above USD 4,040 and the price later corrected lower. 
An immediate support is at USD 4,000, below which the price may perhaps test the USD 3,980 support. The main buy area is near the USD 3,950 level. On the upside, a strong follow through above USD 4,040 and USD 4,050 is must for buyers to gain traction. Ethereum price  tested the all-important USD 140 resistance level before sellers emerged. ETH/USD corrected lower and recently tested the USD 138 support level. At the outset, it seems like the price is struggling to stay above USD 138 and it could correct towards USD 136.
On the upside, the USD 139 and USD 140 levels are important resistances. A successful close above USD 140 may push the price towards the USD 144 level. Bitcoin cash price  extended its rally above the USD 168 and USD 170 levels. BCH/USD traded close to the USD 174 level and recently corrected below the USD 170 support. The next key support is near the USD 165 level, where buyers might appear.
EOS  surged above the USD 4.00 and USD 4.20 resistance levels. The price even broke the USD 4.30 resistance and traded close to USD 4.35. It is currently correcting lower towards the USD 4.20 and USD 4.15 support levels.
Ripple price  climbed higher towards the USD 0.309 and USD 0.310 resistance levels, where buyers struggled. As a result, there was a downside correction and the price declined below the USD 0.306 support. It is currently testing USD 0.305 and the next support is at USD 0.304. Despite corrective moves in bitcoin and ethereum, a few small cap altcoins gained more than 8%, including MANA, RVN, XTZ, FCT, NULS, AION and BAT. Out of these, MANA climbed more than 36% and RVN is up close to 28%. The current price action suggests a downside correction in bitcoin price below the USD 4,000 support level. However, declines are likely to find a strong buying interest and BTC/USD might bounce back from the USD 3,980 or USD 3,950 support in the coming sessions.

" Recently, we saw a downside reaction in bitcoin below the USD 3,950 support level. BTC tested the USD 3,900 support level on a couple of occasions, but sellers failed to retain control. Finally, bulls had the upper hand and the price reversed above the USD 3,950 and USD 3,980 resistance levels. Similarly, there was a sharp bullish reaction in ethereum price from the USD 130 support. ETH rallied above USD 135 and it is currently (UTC 08:00 AM) trading above USD 137. Ripple price too recovered and climbed back above the USD 0.300 and USD 0.305 resistance levels, with bullish moves.  Total market capitalization  Yesterday, there was another test of the USD 3,900 support by bitcoin price . There were a couple of spikes near the USD 3,900 before sellers gave up. Finally, there was a strong bullish reaction and the price climbed above the USD 3,950 and USD 3,980 resistance levels.
The price is now trading near the USD 4,000 resistance. If there is follow through above USD 4,000 and 4,015, the price is likely to accelerate towards the USD 4,070 swing high. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,980, but the main support is near the USD 3,950 level. Ethereum price  tested the USD 130 support area, where a strong buying interest emerged. As a result, ETH started a solid upward move and traded above the USD 132 and USD 135 resistance levels.
The price even broke the USD 137 level and it is currently consolidating below the USD 138 resistance. The next key resistance is near the USD 140 level. On the downside, the USD 135 level may once again act as a support. Bitcoin cash price  jumped by more than 5% and broke the USD 160 and USD 164 resistance levels. BCH/USD is currently trading near the USD 166 level and it may continue to rise towards the USD 170 resistance.
EOS  performed really well and climbed above the USD 3.85 resistance level. The price is up more than 10% and it recently cleared the USD 4.00 resistance. A high was formed near USD 4.10 level and the price is currently consolidating gains.
Ripple price  tested the USD 0.295 support level before starting a fresh rebound. XRP/USD traded above the USD 0.300 and USD 0.305 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. The next major hurdle for buyers is near the USD 0.308 level. In the past three sessions, many small cap altcoins recovered and jumped more than 10%, including ENG, WICC, WTC, ADA, WAN, PIVX and XZC. Out of these, ENG climbed more than 50% and WICC is up close to 13%. Overall, bitcoin price jumped back in a positive zone, with a close above the USD 3,950 and USD 3,970. However, the USD 4,000 resistance is still intact. Therefore, a clear break above the USD 4,000 level is must for BTC buyers to retain action and push the price further higher.

" After a strong rejection near the USD 4,000 resistance, bitcoin price started a sharp decline. BTC declined below the USD 3,980 and USD 3,950 support levels. It moved into a bearish zone and tested the USD 3,900 support level. Similarly, there were bearish moves in ethereum below the USD 136 and USD 135 support levels. ETH tested the USD 132 support and it is currently (UTC 08:10 AM) correcting higher. Ripple price is trading with a bearish bias near USD 0.300 and it may continue to decline in the near term.

BTC declined below the USD 3,950 support level and it even spiked below the USD 3,900 level. It is correcting higher towards the USD 3,950 level, which was a support earlier and now it could act as a resistance.
If buyers push the price above USD 3,950, the price may revisit the USD 4,000 resistance. If not, there is a risk of a fresh decline towards USD 3,900 or USD 3,860 in the coming sessions. Ethereum price  also faced an increase in selling pressure after it failed to surpass the USD 138 resistance. ETH/USD declined below the USD 135 support level and tested the next key support at USD 132.
The price is currently correcting higher above USD 133, but it is likely to face sellers near the USD 134 or 135 levels. On the downside, a break below the USD 132 support may push the price towards USD 130. Bitcoin cash price  trimmed most of its recent gains and broke the USD 160 support level. BCH/USD is currently trading near USD 158 and it may continue to move down towards the USD 155 support level.
EOS  was comparatively stable above the USD 3.62 support. However, there are many hurdles on the upside near the USD 3.65 and USD 3.70 levels. On the downside, the main support is near the USD 3.60 level.
Ripple price  declined below the USD 0.306 and USD 0.304 support levels. XRP/USD is trading near the USD 0.300 support and it may continue to decline towards the USD 0.295 and USD 0.292 support levels in the near term.

In the past three sessions, many small cap altcoins declined more than 8%, including DGB, AOA, POLY, ABBC, ONT, QBIT, STEEM, PAI, ICX and QASH. Out of these, DGB is down around 15% and AOA fell close to 13%. Overall, bitcoin price failed to gain bullish momentum above the USD 4,000 resistance and declined sharply. Going forward, the USD 3,900 support might play a crucial role for the next move. If BTC settles below USD 3,900, there could be additional losses in the coming days.

" Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of popular cryptocurrency trading platform BitMEX, has recently predicted that Bitcoin will more than double and reach USD 10,000 per coin this year. This is far from the first prediction he has made: from reminding people during the bull market in December 2017 that Bitcoin is still extremely volatile, over calling a USD 50,000 forecast in case of a positive regulatory ETF during 2018, to calling a bottom at USD 2,000. Now, his latest prediction is again bullish.  “Green shoots will begin to appear in early Q4. Free money and collective amnesia are powerful drugs. Also after two years of wage cucking, punters should have a few sheckles [sic] to rub together,” said the CEO in a newsletter last Friday, adding, “The 2019 chop will be intense, but the markets will claw back to USD 10,000. That is a very significant psychological barrier. It’s a nice round sexy number."" According to Hayes, USD 20,000 is the ultimate recovery.  ""However, it took 11 months from USD 1,000 to USD 10,000, but less than one month from USD 10,000 to USD 20,000 back to USD 10,000. Melissa Lee [a reporter and news anchor for CNBC] peep this. USD 10,000 is my number, and I’m stickin’ to it,” he said. Following the prediction by Hayes, a Twitter poll showed that 59% of around 1,000 respondents see Bitcoin reaching USD 10,000 by the end of the year. Lets first get to $6000 range and see what happens 😋 Meanwhile, back when the cryptoverse was booming and Bitcoin was reaching its heights in December 2017, Hayes warned in an interview with Forbes: “People have been lulled into complacency with a market that keeps going up every day. They don’t understand that this is an extremely volatile asset. It’s not constrained by national borders and there are people out to do whatever they can to make money, including nefarious things against exchanges.”  Sure enough, the price dropped in the coming days and never recovered to those heights again.  His next famous prediction came in June 2018 in an interview with news outlet CNBC, when he said that a positive regulatory response to Bitcoin could send it soaring to USD 50,000 by the end of that year. Unfortunately, the positive response did not happen, and so neither did his prediction come to pass.  However, his idea of a bottom looks more accurate: “I think that something that goes up to USD 20,000 in one year can have a correction down to USD 6,000 and will definitely find a bottom at about USD 3,000 and USD 5,000 range.”  When it was obvious that there was no time for a regulatory response to send Bitcoin up before the end of 2018, Hayes suggested that Bitcoin could bottom out at USD 2,000 before reversing course back in November 2018.

Ripple price  faced a solid rise in selling pressure after it broke the USD 0.310 support. XRP/USD fell below USD 0.305 and even spiked below USD 0.300. The price later recovered above USD 0.305, but the USD 0.310 level is preventing gains. In the past three sessions, many small cap altcoins trimmed gains and declined between 5%-10%, including MOAC, ONT, KCS, CRO, HT, LRC, LINK, ICX, BTT and KMD. Out of these, MOAC is down around 10% and ONT fell close to 9.5%. Overall, bitcoin price recovered after a sharp decline below USD 3,950. However, BTC/USD must surpass the USD 4,000 and USD 4,010 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. If not, there is a risk of another slide in the coming sessions towards USD 3,920 or USD 3,900.

Moreover, ""it's aligned with our broader interests: a more accessible global financial system for the internet.""

" After a short term downside correction, bitcoin price found support and recovered above USD 3,950. BTC/USD is climbing higher and it is currently (UTC 08:10 AM) trading just above the USD 4,000 resistance, with a bullish angle. Therefore, there are chances of more upsides above USD 4,025 and USD 4,050 in the coming sessions. On the other hand, ethereum price was mostly flat, but it stayed above the USD 135 and USD 136 support levels. Ripple price started a short term rebound and climbed above the USD 0.313 level. It seems like XRP/USD is preparing for an upward move above USD 0.314 and USD 0.315. Total market capitalization  In the past few hours, bitcoin price  managed to gain traction as it broke the USD 3,980 and USD 4,000 resistance levels. BTC/USD is up around 0.5% and it seems like it could break the USD 4,025 resistance and revisit the USD 4,050 level. If there are further gains, the price may target the USD 4,100 level. 
On the downside, the USD 4,000 and USD 3,980 levels are likely to act as supports. If buyers fail to retain strength, the price could decline back towards the USD 3,950 support. Ethereum price  remained well bid above the USD 135 and USD 136 support levels. However, ETH/USD is facing a strong resistance near the USD 138 level, above which there are chances of a break above the USD 140 resistance level.
If sellers remain in action near USD 138 or USD 140, the price could revisit the USD 135 support. Any further losses may push the price into a bearish zone, with the next support at USD 130. Bitcoin cash price  started a downside correction below the USD 160 support. BCH/USD is currently down around 1% and it seems like it could test the USD 155 support level in the near term.
EOS  is currently consolidating above the USD 3.65 support level. To start a fresh bullish wave, the price must break the USD 3.75 and USD 3.80 resistance levels. The main resistance above USD 3.80 is at USD 4.00.
Ripple price  managed to stay above the USD 0.312 support and it is currently correcting higher. If XRP/USD surpasses the USD 0.314 and USD 0.315 resistance levels, there could be decent gains towards USD 0.320. During the past two sessions, many small cap altcoins started an upward move and gained more than 10%, including XTZ, GXC, HT, RVN, PAI, CRO, ZEC and IOST. Out of these, XTZ is up more than 17% and GXC gained nearly 16%. The current price action suggests bitcoin price is gaining momentum above USD 4,000. Having said that, BTC/USD must move above the USD 4,025 and USD 4,050 resistance levels to start a solid upward move. On the other hand, ethereum is stuck in a range and it is likely preparing for the next break.

BTC/USD is currently (UTC 08:00 AM) consolidating in a range and facing a solid resistance near the USD 4,000 level. If it continues to face sellers near USD 4,000, there could be a short-term bearish reaction towards the USD 3,900 support area. Similarly, ethereum price is now trading below the USD 140 resistance and struggling to climb higher.

We are in a: Total market capitalization  After bullish moves, bitcoin price  declined below USD 4,000 and tested the USD 3,950 support level. Later, BTC/USD started trading in a tight range and it seems like buyers are finding it hard to clear the USD 4,000 and USD 4,010 resistance levels. If they continue to struggle, there is a risk of a downside reaction towards the USD 3,950 or USD 3,900 support area.
On the other hand, a proper close and follow through above USD 4,000 may perhaps call for more upsides above the USD 4,050 resistance level in the coming sessions. Ethereum price  corrected lower and settled below the USD 140 support level. ETH/USD is currently trading well below the USD 140 support, with a bearish angle and it seems like it could decline towards the USD 135 support.
On the upside, the main resistance is at USD 140, above which the price is likely to revisit the USD 145 resistance area and this month’s high. Bitcoin cash price  faced a strong selling interest near the USD 165 level and it recently corrected below the USD 160 level. BCH/USD may continue to move down and it could test the next key support at USD 150.
EOS  is moving lower and it is currently trading below USD 3.70. An immediate support is at USD 3.65, below which the price could decline towards the USD 3.62 support. On the upside, the key resistances are USD 3.75 and USD 3.80.
Ripple price  failed to stay in the positive zone and declined below the USD 0.314 support. XRP/USD is currently holding the USD 0.312 support, but there is a risk of more losses towards the USD 0.311 or USD 0.310 support zone.

Out of these, KIN rallied more than 35% and RVN is up close to 15%. Overall, bitcoin is trading in a tight range and it seems to be preparing for the next break either above USD 4,000 or below USD 3,950. If there is a downside correction, BTC buyers are likely to protect the key USD 3,900 support, which was a solid resistance this past week.

" On Monday, the sentiment surrounding the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization is more positive than a week ago, according to Predicoin, a crypto market sentiment analysis service. Moreover, Bitcoin Sentscore seems to be back to the range it had before mid-November crash, according to Pierre-Alexandre Picard, co-founder and CMO of Predicoin.  Bitcoin SentScore since August 2019: Meanwhile, the average market sentiment score among the top ten today is 5.65, again higher than last week (5.43) and marking yet another improvement on a week-by-week basis. For Bitcoin, it's fourth Monday in a row with the highest score (6.7) out of the top 10. Bitcoin Cash (5.7) and Stellar (5.5) made it onto the winning list this time, joining the same winners as last week: Bitcoin (6.7), Litecoin and EOS (6.2 both), Ethereum (6.1), and Binance Coin (5.9).  Sentiment change among the top 10 coins*:
Interpreting the SentScore’s scale:
- 0 to 2,5: very negative
- 2 to 4,5: somewhat negative zone
- 4,5 to 5,5: Neutral zone
- 5,5 to 7,5: somewhat positive zone
- 7,5 to 10: very positive This is Stellar’s first time on the winning list since we started these weekly updates in February 2019, and only its second time above the negative range. Part of the buzz, which shows the intensity of social interest for a coin, around Stellar comes from the fact that the congregation of payments, FinTech and financial services industry called the Money 20/20 conference in Asia is due to start tomorrow, March 19th, and will feature Stellar’s co-founder Jed McCaleb as one of the speakers, Picard suggested. Also, it is expected that Stellar will make a joint announcement with information technology giant IBM, as Jesse Lund, IBM’s Head of Blockchain and Digital Currencies, will join McCaleb on stage. (Updated: On Monday, IBM announced a payments network based on blockchain and the Stellar protocol.) Meanwhile, despite an increase, XRP  still has the lowest score of 4.5, which marks the line between the negative and neutral zones. The last time this coin has entered neutral territory was February 25th, when it managed to get a score of 4.7. The neutral list holds Tether (4.6) and TRON (5.1), where the former dropped compared to last week, while the latter rose. Tether’s drop can, at least partially, be attributed to the news that its USD 2 billion token supply is now backed by not only real US dollars, but other assets, also, according to Picard.  Bitcoin Cash and XRP are both winners in the weekly change category with 8.7% improvement compared to last week. Bitcoin Cash found its strength in news, which got a score of 7.8, while its weakest spot are fundamentals with 3.1. XRP’s score explains its total score and why it’s so low: news are again on their side with 6.4, but the technical side only scored 2.3. The biggest loser is Binance Coin with a drop of 1.8%, followed by Ethereum with -1.6% and Bitcoin with -1.5%. However, all of them still remain on the winning list. Binance Coin’s strength is technical, with 7.5, while its weakness is fundamental - 3.7. Ethereum’s strength is also news with 6.4, but weakness is also technical with 3.5. Bitcoin’s fundamentals are soaring at 8.6, while the social aspect - at 4.5 - leaves something to be desired.

It is currently (UTC 08:00 AM) trading below USD 4,000, with many supports on the downside above USD 3,900. Similarly, there were bullish moves in ethereum price above USD 135 and USD 140. ETH tested the USD 145 resistance and recently corrected below USD 140. Ripple price spiked above the USD 0.320 resistance on two occasions, but it failed to hold gains and later corrected towards the USD 0.312 support. Total market capitalization  Finally, there was a strong bullish wave in bitcoin price  above the USD 3,900 resistance. BTC/USD even broke the USD 4,000 weekly resistance area before sellers emerged near the USD 4,050 level. A high was formed just below USD 4,060 before the price started a downside correction.
The price is currently trading below the USD 4,000 level, with an immediate support at USD 3,950 and 3,940. However, the main weekly support is at USD 3,900, which was a key resistance earlier. On the upside, the key resistances are near USD 4,000 and USD 4,050. Ethereum price  also followed a similar pattern and climbed above the USD 135 and USD 140 resistance levels. ETH/USD tested the USD 145 resistance and later corrected below the USD 140 level.
The main weekly supports are at USD 135 and USD 132, below which there is a risk of more losses below the USD 130 support in the near term. On the upside, the USD 140 level is an initial resistance, followed by the USD 145 pivot level. Bitcoin cash  performed well recently as it rallied above the USD 140 and USD 148 resistance levels. BCH/USD even surged above USD 160 before sellers appeared near USD 165. It is currently correcting lower, with supports near USD 155 and USD 150.
EOS  made another attempt to clear the USD 3.80 resistance, but buyers failed to gain momentum. The price is currently correcting below USD 3.75 and it may continue to decline towards the USD 3.65 or USD 3.62 support area.
Ripple price  spiked on a couple of occasions towards the USD 0.320 resistance, but it failed to stay above USD 0.320 and USD 0.318. XRP/USD corrected lower recently and tested the USD 0.314 support. The next main supports are USD 0.312 and USD 0.310. Despite dips in bitcoin and ETH, a few small cap altcoins traded higher and gained more than 8%, including WAX, GXC, KCS, CRO, R and BCH. Out of these, WAX rallied more than 11% and GXC is up around 10%. Overall, the recent upward move in bitcoin was encouraging, but the current correction wave must find support near USD 3,950 or USD 3,920. On the upside, a fresh daily close above USD 4,000 could trigger renewed buying interest in BTC in the coming sessions.

" Bitcoin is going to spend a lot of time below USD 6,000 sort of fixing itself and it might take 5-6 months before it starts to look like it’s back in a bull market, Head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors and famous Bitcoin bull Tom Lee said. “I think 2019 is a year about repair,” Lee said in an interview with CNBC, adding, “We have a risk-on rally in global markets that's positive for Bitcoin; it was a headwind last year. And the dollar isn't surging like it was last year. That's a headwind that's gone away.” The interest that both traditional financial institutions and other entities such as social networks are showing for crypto assets is also going to boost the price forward, he believes.  “We've seen the launch of digital currencies by not only JPMorgan and Mizuho Bank, but also Facebook and some social media companies gearing up. And, of course, in places like Venezuela, where bitcoin's become very large and widely used, turmoil is causing adoption growth. So I think these are really setting up for a strong ... year,” he said. But how can you tell where the price is headed? The secret lies in watching 200-day moving averages, Lee believes. The moving average is the calculation of the closing prices of an asset over a period of time, and if Bitcoin keeps at its current trading price of below USD 4,000, “it'll cross above its 200-day by August,” he believes. The real damage was dealt during the Bitcoin Cash fork wars, when the whole market collapsed, mid-November 2018. “I think it really undermined investor confidence in sort of the dynamics around the market, so I think that bitcoin's going to spend a lot of time below USD 6,000 sort of fixing itself,” he explained, adding that ""the outside window is five or six months before bitcoin starts to look technically like it’s back in a bull market.” According to 2019 Outlook report for the cryptocurrency market, published by Fundstrat in February, the firm admits that 2018 was a disappointing year for crypto, while also adding that they expect the market to stage “a visible recovery” in 2019.  Meanwhile, popular cryptocurrency analyst Murad Mahmudov and Arjun Balaji, an independent blockchain researcher, reportedly see the Bitcoin bottom in the USD 2,000 - USD 2,500 range by the end of summer 2019, while another crypto analyst and trader Tone Vays is the one to go as low as USD 1,300. Tom Lee started out by saying that Bitcoin could climb back to USD 20,000 by mid-2018 and even reach USD 25,000 by the end of December of that year. He later amended this end-of-the-year forecast, pulling it down to a USD 20,000 - USD 22,000 range. Then in November, when Bitcoin was trading at around USD 5,500, Lee was certain the price would triple in the remaining month and a half. When all his forecasts failed, he maintained that the market was wrong and that Bitcoin’s true value lied between USD 13,800 and USD 14,800 in December 2018. In January 2019, he confirmed that USD 25,000 per Bitcoin forecast is a good value for the cryptocurrency, but that the timing “may be difficult.”

" The former CEO of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox, Mark Karpeles, will likely avoid having to serve prison time in Japan after receiving a suspended sentence. Karpeles was on Friday found guilty by the Tokyo District Court for tampering with the exchange’s financial records, as well as mixing his personal finances with those of the exchange, according to multiple media reports. However, the court dismissed the embezzlement charges that had also been raised against Karpeles, saying he “acted without ill intent.” Karpeles originally faced a prison term of up to 10 years in Japan for the embezzlement charges. “The charge of electronic record tampering is true and deserves punishment, but there’s no criminal evidence of embezzlement,” the court said, Bloomberg reported. It further blamed the 33-year-old Frenchman for “massive harm to the trust of his users.”  “There is no excuse for the defendant, who is an engineer with expert knowledge, to abuse his status and authority to perform clever criminal acts,” the court said, before giving him a 2 1/2 year “suspended sentence,” which does not need to be served unless another crime is committed within four years. Karpeles, who has maintained his innocence throughout the trial, was also ordered to pay for part of the cost of the trial. Finished reading Karpeles verdict. In summary, the court found that the way he ran Mt. Gox was a total mess and that he tampered w/ records to hide the fact it was missing a lot of Bitcoin, but he did not do it for personal gain or have ill intent. Attaching relevant parts. pic.twitter.com/3n7oEwSsK0 “I am happy to be judged not guilty for embezzlement and breach of trust. I will discuss with my lawyers and decide how to proceed on the remaining charge,” Karpeles told CNN in a brief comment. Mark Karpeles bought Mt. Gox, which was originally a marketplace for illustrated cards, in 2011 and turned it into the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. In 2014, the exchange collapsed in a spectacular fashion after 850,000 bitcoins were stolen, leading to a loss of nearly USD 500 million for users of the exchange. To this day, the majority of the missing bitcoins have yet to be recovered. More than four years after the infamous Mt. Gox incident victims have been filing rehabilitation claims and are now waiting to be reimbursed. However, it seems that they might need to wait even longer, as two different entities are slowing down the process: cryptocurrency company CoinLab, headed by CEO Peter Vessenes, and former child actor and crypto entrepreneur Brock Pierce, as previously reported. _____

The exchange operator also says it is currently considering its future stance on cryptocurrency derivatives trading. According to an official release, the CFE operator stated, “The CFE is assessing its approach with respect to how it plans to continue to offer digital asset derivatives for trading. While it considers its next steps, the CFE does not currently intend to list additional XBT futures contracts for trading.” The exchange noted, however, that “currently listed XBT futures contracts remain available for trading” – meaning existing futures listed last month (XBTM19) will continue to run until June. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts on Twitter and Reddit speculated that low trading volumes and competitor success may have been contributing factors in the CBOE’s decision.

" At the Token2049 event in Hong Kong, which ended today, things were far from boring: Estonian crypto exchange DX.Exchange has announced their own security token, while other panelists were looking for the Bitcoin bottom, and the team behind smart contract platform Tron has reportedly sent someone in an avocado costume to troll Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of competing platform Ethereum. Estonia-based digital asset marketplace DX.Exchange announced at the conference that it will begin to list security tokens starting today, March 14th, along with launching their own token, dubbed In Good We Trust (IGWT). The token’s purpose is to showcase the new security token service and help raise funds for the company, which will be restructured into a new entity called DXtech Exchange. They have also announced that 18 million IGWT tokens will be sold in a private sale, with 10% of the exchange’s profits to be regularly distributed to the token holders. There will be no minimum investment amount. DX.Exchange’s CEO and co-founder Daniel Skowronski said at his panel, titled “STOs and Security Tokens - The Future of Crypto is Closer than we Think” that the move would “mark a further step towards realizing its vision of tokenizing the world and opening the doors to a new crypto economy.” He went on to add, “We believe that all assets whether its securities, art or real-estate will be tokenized. This tokenization has many benefits but the strongest is the ability to help create wealth for people all over the world no matter their social economic situation. At DX, we can help trade the untradeable.” A panel, titled “Crypto Analysts: When Moon?” called out new bottoms - reportedly as low as USD 1,300 for Bitcoin.  According to tweets from the event, popular cryptocurrency analyst Murad Mahmudov and Arjun Balaji, an independent blockchain researcher, see the Bitcoin bottom in the USD 2,000 - USD 2,500 range by the end of summer 2019, while another crypto analyst and trader Tone Vays is the one to go as low as USD 1,300. However, at least Mahmudov and Balaji are reportedly more optimistic about 2020.

Users are now able to deposit, invest, and withdraw ether directly from the Abra app. Interestingly, ETH was previously available on Abra as a synthetic asset, meaning that users had exposure to the price movements of ether and could only make deposits into the Abra app via a US-based bank account, American Express card, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin. Now, users can directly deposit and withdraw ETH via any Ethereum wallet. “By adding native ether support, Abra users will now be able to easily buy and move ether from other wallets to the Abra app,” said Bill Barhydt, CEO and founder of Abra. “This also opens up the potential to use ETH as an on-ramp to invest in the other assets listed on Abra.” The avocado issue started on Twitter, between Tron CEO Justin Sun and Buterin. After Tron acquired BitTorrent,  a file sharing protocol with the community of over 100 million users, and launched the BitTorrent token, Sun dug out an interview from 2017 where Buterin praises BitTorrent. The latter was quick to correct the assumption that he is indirectly endorsing Tron: “That interview was from Aug 2017. Tron acquired BitTorrent in July 2018. My praise for BitTorrent had nothing to do with Tron. This is like implying that because I like avocados, I approve of everyone who has ever bought an avocado.” Now, the Tron community got stuck on the avocado comment.

" In the past few sessions, bitcoin mostly traded in a tight range below the USD 3,900 resistance level. BTC is stuck between USD 3,850 and USD 3,900 and it seems like it is preparing for the next key break. Ethereum price is slowly moving down after it failed to break the USD 135 resistance level. ETH declined below USD 132 and it could test the USD 130 support. On the other hand, ripple price spiked above the USD 0.320 resistance, but it failed to hold gains and retested the USD 0.310 support area.  Total market capitalization  There was another attempt by bitcoin price  to clear the USD 3,900 resistance, but buyers failed to gain momentum. BTC retreated a few points, but it remained in a tight range above the USD 3,850 support and below the USD 3,900 resistance. It seems like the price is all set for the next break, which could be either above USD 3,900 or towards USD 3,800 and 3,720.
Once there is an upside break above USD 3,900, buyers are likely to take control. The next key resistance is near the USD 3,980 - USD 4,000 zone, where sellers might put up a strong fight. Ethereum price  started following a slow and steady bearish path after it failed to break the USD 135 resistance. ETH is approaching (UTC 08:10 AM) the USD 130 support, which could play an important role in the near term.
If buyers fail to defend the USD 1303 support, the price may decline sharply. On the other hand, the price could bounce back and even make an attempt to surpass the USD 134 and USD 135 resistance levels. Bitcoin cash price  is slowly moving higher and it recently broke the USD 130 resistance level. BCH/USD is showing a few positive signs and it seems like buyers could push the price above the USD 132 resistance level.
EOS  is currently consolidating above the USD 3.50 support level. To start a fresh upward move, the price must clear the USD 3.60 and USD 3.70 resistance levels. On the downside, the USD 3.50 support is very important, below which there could be heavy losses.
Ripple price  rallied recently above the USD 0.315 and USD 0.320 resistance levels. However, XRP/USD fails to hold gains and declined sharply to revisit the USD 0.310 support level. The price may consolidate for a few hours before a fresh upward move. Despite range moves in bitcoin, a few small cap altcoins gained traction and moved up by more than 7%, including ETN, WAX, REPO, ETN, BCD, INB, PIVX, XLM and KCS. Out of these, ETN rallied more than 20% and WAX is up close to 18%. Overall, bitcoin price is trading near a crucial inflection point and is likely preparing for the next key break. BTC could either clear the USD 3,900 hurdle and rally strongly or decline sharply below the USD 3,800 support level.

" The European Central Bank (ECB), the central bank for the Eurozone, is unwittingly boosting the case for cryptocurrency adoption, the community believes - and that’s exactly the last thing they want to be doing. This comes after they said they could always create money, and the crypto community was quick to reply with accusations of scamming. The bank had started a Twitter thread under the hashtag #AskECB, and Twitter user @Gianluca844 took the chance to ask, “Where did you get the money for the [quantitative easing]?” The bank replied:  Praet: As a central bank, we can create money to buy assets #AskECB https://t.co/zTQuU4y1ch The quote was attributed to Peter Praet, executive board member and chief economist of the ECB.  Quantitative easing (QE), also known as large-scale asset purchases, is an expansionary monetary policy whereby a central bank, which is the ECB in this case, buys predetermined amounts of government bonds or other financial assets in order to stimulate the economy and increase liquidity.  This operation started in 2015 and was finished by the end of 2018, during which the ECB has spent EUR 2.6 trillion (USD 3 trillion), buying up mostly government but also corporate debt, asset-backed securities and covered bonds, at a pace of EUR 1.3 million a minute, according to Reuters. That equates to roughly 7,600 euros (BTC 2.23) for every person in the currency bloc. The cryptocurrency community took issue with the reply, with many tweeting gifs of the Bitconnect Ponzi scheme, which has since its downfall become synonymous with shady doings. “Central banks are marketing bitcoin better than we can,” replied Twitter user @zackvoell, while user @wiz has more to say: “The world is now opening their eyes to your scam of robbing people of their purchasing power by endlessly printing bank notes on worthless paper. The global economy will implement a new Bitcoin standard to opt-out of your scam and prevent further theft by central banks.” ""As a reminder, when central banks and governments decide to simply print more money, they are stealing wealth from majority of the population and enriching the elites. According to the [International Monetary Fund], inflation is one of the leading causes of income inequality in the world,"" Anthony Pompliano, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, a digital asset management firm, wrote in his newsletter.  He went further to explain that ""inflation leads to rising prices for real assets (real estate, etc), which are owned by the elites generally."" ""Central banks may be able to print more fiat dollars, but eventually the Ponzi scheme will end. When it does, Bitcoin will be there, as scarce as ever, with the inability for anyone to print more,"" the famous Bitcoin bull concluded.  An interesting point was raised by user @spiroseliot, who tweeted a picture of a street, supposedly in Venezuela, filled with paper money that was rendered worthless due to the country’s recent hyperinflation. the real value of paper-fiat money... pic.twitter.com/hLyWWJDfBg One of the main points that Bitcoin proponents raise as an advantage over central bank policies is the fact that Bitcoin is capped at 21 million units, which means that in times of shortage, it cannot be printed, which prevents inflation. However, due to the laws of supply and demand, the price of individual bitcoins would rise. Additionally, due to its decentralized and mathematically specified nature, the asset cannot be controlled by any given entity.  On the other hand, the QE was launched as a way to prevent sub-zero inflation from further hitting an economy still reeling from the euro zone debt crisis in March 2015. While it did lift economic growth, helping the rise of wages and lending while keeping inflation subdued, the ECB has also been criticized because the bond buying has depressed interest rates and hurt European banks’ profitability. Meanwhile, the Basel Committee, the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks, stressed that ""crypto-assets"" [that] are at times referred to as ""crypto-currencies"", do not reliably provide the standard functions of money and are unsafe to rely on as a medium of exchange or store of value.  ""Crypto-assets are not legal tender, and are not backed by any government or public authority,"" the Committee said in an announcement today.  ""They present a number of risks for banks, including liquidity risk; credit risk; market risk; operational risk (including fraud and cyber risks); money laundering and terrorist financing risk; and legal and reputation risks,"" it added.

" After a short term downside correction, bitcoin price rebounded above USD 3,830 and USD 3,850. BTC even climbed above USD 3,880, but it struggled to gain momentum above the USD 3,900 resistance level. It is currently consolidating below USD 3,900 and it seems like buyers are sighting an upside break in the near term. Ethereum remained well below the USD 135 resistance and it is currently (UTC 08:00 AM) testing the key USD 132 support. Ripple price climbed higher and settled above USD 0.310, with a positive angle. Total market capitalization  There were mostly range moves in bitcoin price  above the USD 3,830 and USD 3,850 support levels in the past two sessions. BTC made an attempt to climb above USD 3,900, but it failed. Having said that, the price action suggests that there are high chances of more gains above USD 3,900 and USD 3,920 in the short term.
On the other hand, if there is a downside reaction, the USD 3,850 level may act as a support. Any further declines could take the price towards the key USD 3,800 support level. Ethereum price  struggled to break the USD 135 resistance and declined recently towards the USD 132 support. If there are more losses, ETH could revisit the key USD 130 support level in the next few hours.
On the upside, the USD 134 and USD 135 levels are important hurdles. Should there be an upside break above USD 135, the price will most likely climb above the USD 140 resistance level. Bitcoin cash price  settled below the USD 130 support and it is currently consolidating near the USD 128 level. If BCH/USD needs to climb higher, it must break the USD 130 and USD 132 resistance levels. If not, it may revisit the USD 125 support.
EOS  struggled to clear the USD 3.70 resistance and corrected lower. However, the USD 3.60 level is acting as a support and it seems like the price may trade higher towards the USD 3.70 and USD 3.75 levels.
Ripple price  is slowly moving higher and it is currently placed above the USD 0.310 support. XRP/USD must break the USD 0.312 resistance level to stage a rebound towards the USD 0.314 and USD 0.315 resistance levels. On the downside, the USD 0.310 and USD 0.305 levels are decent supports. In the past few hours, many small cap altcoins rallied more than 10%, including CRO, XZC, MXM, KMD, BCD, VET, ENJ, KCS, AION, ETN, DGB, BCN, DASH and QASH. Out of these, CRO rallied more than 40% and XZC is up close to 34%. Overall, bitcoin price is trading with a positive angle above the USD 3,850 level. However, BTC buyers need to gain traction above USD 3,900 and USD 3,920 to set the stage for a solid upward move towards USD 4,000 and USD 4,040 in the coming sessions.

" Blockchain technology firm Blockstream has announced that their satellite message API (an application programming interface) Beta is now on the mainnet. Now, sending data through space using a satellite and paying for it with bitcoins is easier than ever - but what possibilities does this offer, exactly? Blockstream aims to solve blockchain’s dependence on the internet by replacing it with satellites. Initially launched in August 2017, the satellite was first available to users from Africa, Europe and the Americas, with the goal to let users access Bitcoin without the need for an internet connection. In December 2018, the company announced their coverage of the Asia-Pacific region, as well as adding support for Lightning Network payments.  According to the company, the Blockstream Satellite network broadcasts the Bitcoin blockchain around the world 24/7, protecting against network interruptions and providing anyone in the world with the opportunity to use Bitcoin.  Moreover, the satellite message API lets users send encrypted messages to each other from some of the remotest regions on Earth and pay for those message in bitcoin using the Lightning Network service. Back in December, the company’s chief strategy officer, Samson Mow, told Forbes, “Bitcoin has always been about uncensorable money, and now we have uncensorable communications as well.” Now, for those wondering, “What am I supposed to do with this?” we simply say, “Human ingenuity knows no bounds.” You may decide to use this service to send messages and pay for it with bitcoins, but where’s the fun in that? For example, online publication Vice Motherboard has already used the service to send the Communist Manifesto up to space and back to Earth again, where anyone with the right software and dish setup could receive it. “I sent the passage—the part that says, ‘The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains’—to space, and then back down to Earth, using Bitcoin. My reasoning for doing this was… Well, why the hell not? We live in a world where this is possible, my friends,” writes author Jordan Pearson, without explaining his choice of the Communist Manifesto (it is estimated that communist regimes around the world have killed almost 100 million people.) Blockstream community manager Dan Williams told Vice about his own favorite message. “The most fascinating message I’ve received was what appeared to be a journal from an anonymous developer in eastern Europe who shared his growing interest in Bitcoin and the technology surrounding it such as Blockstream Satellite and the Lightning Network,” he explained. The message itself is even better than it sounds. “So here I am, left my job, I have some money to keep me up and I’m building my first raspberry pi lightning node, and broadcasting messages from satellites. Still feels surreal at times,” part of the diary reads. #SatelliteAPI prose. 💯 🛰️⚡️👽 pic.twitter.com/oePSMVKojO Then, there are poems, and - of course - memes, except now they’re in encrypted form, like the so-called Rare Pepe. However, all of these were sent over the testnet, which made them free; with the mainnet now live, you will have to pay for the service. “I suspect given low message fees, it's easier  and simpler to pay with real BTC because it's actually hard to get Test BTC,” explained Blockstream co-founder and CEO Adam Back. And if you really have a message that you need to broadcast through space, is any fee too high?

" Yesterday, we discussed a possible decline in bitcoin below the USD 3,900 and USD 3,850 supports. The BTC/USD pair did correct lower recently and traded below the USD 3,850 level. It traded towards the USD 3,825 support and later rebounded above USD 3,850. Similarly, there was a downside extension in ethereum price below the USD 132 support before ETH buyers appeared near the USD 130 level. Ripple price declined below the USD 0.310 support and tested the next key support at USD 0.306. The current price action (UTC 08:30 AM) is slightly bearish, but BTC and altcoins are trading near key supports, which may result in a decent recovery in the near term. Total market capitalization  There was a downside break below the USD 3,850 support in bitcoin price . However, there was no test of the USD 3,800 support and declines were contained near the USD 3,825 level. BTC/USD rebounded above USD 3,850, but it is facing a lot of hurdles near the USD 3,900 level.
If there is an upside break above USD 3,900, the price could revisit the USD 3,980 - USD 4,000 resistance area. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,825, below which the price could test the USD 3,800 support level in the near term. Ethereum price  declined below the USD 135 and USD 132 support levels. ETH/USD tested the USD 130 support and it is currently correcting above USD 132. An immediate resistance is at USD 135, followed by the USD 136 pivot level.
On the downside, the USD 132 level is an initial support. If there are more losses, sellers may attempt to clear the USD 130 support. Having said that, if ETH stays above USD 130, it could slowly climb above USD 135. Bitcoin cash price  declined below the USD 128 support and tested the USD 126 support. BCH/USD is currently consolidating losses and it seems like it could correct higher towards the USD 130 or USD 132 resistance.
EOS  tested the key USD 3.50 support level and bounced back. The price broke the USD 3.55 and USD 3.60 resistance levels. The next resistance is at USD 3.70, above which the price could move into a positive zone in the coming sessions.
Ripple price  extended losses below the USD 0.310 and USD 0.308 support levels. XRP/USD tested the USD 0.306 support level and later corrected above USD 0.308. If it clears the USD 0.310 and USD 0.312 resistances, buyers are likely to gain control. In the past two sessions, a few small cap altcoins gained a strong bullish momentum and rallied sharply, including GRS, CRO, R, GNT, QBIT, ARK, POWR and LOOM. Out of these, GRS rallied more than 140% and CRO is up close to 135%. To sum up, bitcoin traded close to the key USD 3,800 support and bounced back. However, BTC must move above the USD 3,900 resistance to climb back in a positive zone. Likewise, ethereum needs to surpass the USD 135 resistance to start a fresh upward move.

The main weekly support is at USD 3,800, below which there is a risk of a downside push towards the USD 3,660 support level. On the upside, BTC buyers may continue to struggle near the USD 4,000 barrier. If there is an upside break, the price could revisit the USD 4,250 level. Ethereum price  made many attempts to clear the USD 140 resistance, but buyers failed to gain strength. As a result, ETH/USD started a downside correction below the USD 138 and USD 136 levels.

" In the past few hours, the market sentiment improved for a few small cap altcoins, which helped bitcoin in moving higher. BTC stayed above the USD 3,850 support and it recently climbed above the USD 3,900 and USD 3,920 levels.

An initial support is near the USD 3,860, followed by USD 3,850. The main support is at USD 3,800, where sellers may struggle.

" Twitter’s bitcoin-friendly CEO Jack Dorsey is making headlines in the cryptoverse again after he tweeted out his public support for the Trezor hardware wallet, saying he paid for it using bitcoin with a payment app called Cash App.  Cash App is a subsidiary of the payment provider Square, a company that was co-founded by Dorsey, and where he remains a large shareholder. Trezor is widely considered the original bitcoin hardware wallet, and has no known affiliation with Dorsey. He did not elaborate on his choice, only hinting that the fact that firmware of Ledger, one the main competitors of Trezor, is not open source, was potentially the reason of this purchase. According to previous statements by Ledger, most parts of their firmware will be open source in the unspecified future. This Moreover, a bit earlier, Dorsey, who has 4.15 million followers on Twitter, once again (un)intentionally endorsed Casa Node, a plug-and-play solution for running a Bitcoin and Lightning Network node, when he tweeted a screenshot of supposedly his smartphone that showed he spent some time with Casa. Despite Dorsey revealed that he got the Casa Node in an earlier tweet on March 1, this new endorsement prompted another wave of enthusiasm in the cryptoverse.   pic.twitter.com/S7kYSVbTRm Dorsey did not specify which Trezor model he bought. SatoshiLabs, the company behind hardware manufacturer Trezor, has recently announced the priciest hardware wallet in the market.  Meanwhile, Marek Palatinus, the CEO of SatoshiLabs told Cryptonews.com in December that the company is working on Lightning Network and Liquid support in Trezor. ""Furthermore, we are working on allowing the usage of SD cards with Trezor Model T to protect the encrypted passwords and files of our users. Additionally, security innovations are coming for those who want more - recovery seed splitting for additional safety of funds,"" he added. As reported in January, Ledger has launched its next generation hardware wallet Ledger Nano X, that comes with support for mobile devices, while replacing the old micro USB cable that was necessary to plug in to validate transactions, with a wireless Bluetooth connection. Also, in a recent The Tales from the Crypt podcast, Dorsey revealed more about just how positively he views bitcoin, saying he recently “maxed out” his weekly bitcoin buying limit on the Cash App. That limit is currently USD 10,000 per week. Although Dorsey has repeatedly refused to reveal how much he holds in bitcoin, one time just replying that he has “enough,” he did tell the show host about his view of the Stacking Satoshis movement – a movement of people who prefer to buy small amounts of bitcoin over long periods of time: “I saw that on Twitter… I thought that was awesome. I would have participated but I already exceeded my limit on the Cash App so I can’t purchase any more,” the tech billionaire explained. Twitter’s CEO is a well-known fan of bitcoin, having previously expressed his support for the idea of a bitcoin tipping functionality for Twitter. According to Dorsey, there is “a pretty active conversation within the company” and that they want to be “smart about it.”
However, a Twitter spokesperson later told Cryptonews.com that the company had “no plans to integrate it” at the time.  Moreover, Dorsey is known to be skeptical towards other crypto projects, arguing in an earlier tweet that: “Bitcoin is resilient. Bitcoin is principled. Bitcoin is native to internet ideals. And it’s a great brand.”",2019-03-08
" Recently, there was a strong rebound in bitcoin above the USD 3,750 and USD 3,800 resistance levels. BTC/USD even broke the USD 3,850 resistance. However, the price is now trading near an important resistance at USD 3,900. Therefore, the price could either rally further above USD 3,900 or start a downside correction. Similarly, ethereum price is trading near a crucial juncture below the USD 140 resistance level. Ripple price is currently (UTC 08:00 AM) trading near USD 0.315 and it could test the USD 0.320 resistance, where sellers might emerge.  Total market capitalization  There was an upside extension above the USD 3,800 resistance in bitcoin price . BTC/USD broke the USD 3,850 resistance and tested the key USD 3,900 resistance (prevented gains earlier as well). In the short term, the price may either break the USD 3,900 resistance and climb towards the USD 4,000 resistance or start a downside correction.
An initial support on the downside is near the USD 3,850 level, below which the price is likely to revisit the USD 3,800 pivot level in the near term. Ethereum price  traded close to the USD 140 resistance, where sellers emerged. ETH/USD is currently trading near the USD 137 level and it seems like it could test the USD 135 support.
As long as the price is below the USD 140 resistance, there is a risk of a fresh downside reaction towards the USD 135 and USD 132 support levels. The main support is near USD 130, where buyers may emerge. Bitcoin cash price  is holding gains above the USD 130 support, but it facing a strong resistance near the USD 132 level. On the downside, a break below the USD 130 support may perhaps push the price back towards the USD 125 support.
EOS  settled above the USD 3.70 support level after yesterday’s rally. However, it seems like buyers are facing a tough challenge near the USD 3.90 level. Therefore, there are chances of a downside correction below the USD 3.70 and USD 3.65 support levels.
Ripple price  failed once to break the USD 0.320 resistance and corrected towards the USD 0.315 level. XRP/USD might trade higher again towards the USD 0.320 resistance before the next move. In the past few hours, many small cap altcoins gained bullish momentum and rallied more than 10%, including ABBC, RNV, HT, DGTX, KCS, BNB, AOA and STEEM. Out of these, ABBC rallied more than 50% and RVN is up close to 28%.
To sum up, bitcoin price is clearly struggling near the USD 3,900 resistance zone. If BTC buyers continue to face strong offers, there are chances of a short term downside correction. Similarly, ethereum could retreat from the USD 140 resistance and ripple price might retest the USD 0.310 support level.

" The r/bitcoin subreddit has been buzzing with fun and action lately since users are trying to find a proper symbol for Satoshi, the smallest divisible fraction of Bitcoin. While Bitcoin has had a logo for years, it seems that no one noticed that there is no symbol for a humble Satoshi. A Satoshi (sat) is the smallest unit of Bitcoin. While a single BTC has eight decimal places, it consists of 100 million Satoshi. Its name derives from the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.  Lightning Network and apps like Tippin have spurred new talks about micropayments. What’s more, there is an ongoing #stackingsats (Stacking Satoshis) movement, which is fueled by the idea of saving small stacks of Bitcoin that will be worth a lot some day. Amid all the action, some users began to submit their Satoshi symbol designs on r/bitcoin.

" Proponents of the ""Long Bitcoin, Short the Bankers"" movement now can pinpoint another example where cryptocurrencies might be better than the traditional banking system. A new bill has been introduced in California, where Assemblymember Phil Ting seeks to enable crypto payments for city and county taxes for the cannabis-related businesses. It is estimated that doing so would make the taxpaying process safer for local cannabis stores.  If the new bill becomes law, cities, and counties would choose whether they want to accept digital currencies from marijuana businesses, CBS Sacramento reported, adding that it could happen as soon as 2020. The recreational use of cannabis is legal in many states, including California, Colorado, Washington, Alaska, Oregon, Massachusetts, Nevada, and Vermont. However, banks do not want to deal with local cannabis businesses. Most banks are secured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which prevents the provision of services for any activity which is illegal under the federal law. Thus, most pot shops are unable to write checks and perform other basic financial operations. Consequentially, they are forced to deal with large sums of cash. In turn, it makes them easy targets for thieves.  Since cannabis business owners often arrive at the tax offices with suitcases of cash, the bill specifically aims to ease the process of tax paying. It proposes that cannabis-related companies could pay excise and cultivation taxes directly with stablecoins or by utilizing a third-party digital asset payment processors in effect from as soon as 2020. The danger of moving cash also affects the safety of local neighborhoods, too. “A small cannabis store just like a small storefront. They’re in a residential neighborhood. There are people who live there who are all around. If something happened that was potentially violent or dangerous, there could be repercussions for that neighborhood,” Ting told CBS Sacramento. Paying taxes with cryptocurrencies is not unorthodox since it has already been made possible in the state of Ohio since November 2018. The local tax offices accept crypto payments in bitcoin using third-party payment processor BitPay. However, there is a twist - even if a company pays their taxes in Bitcoin, the state will receive US dollars, as BitPay converts the cryptocurrency to fiat and transfers it to the state of Ohio. In either case, as of February 19, only two businesses have taken advantage of their right to pay their taxes in bitcoin, according to media reports. Despite reports suggest that actual uptake of new opportunities to pay taxes in crypto has fallen below expectations, the status of crypto as a popular means of paying taxes, fees and fines may come closer to realization in the future, as reported by Cryptonews.com. On another note, cryptocurrencies and marijuana industry have many things in common. Both of them are in the early stages of development, are often misrepresented in the press, and face legal and regulatory issues.  As such, numerous companies see the opportunity in bridging the gap between blockchain and cannabis industries, as blockchains ability to track and record everything “from seed to sale” could significantly enhance the legitimacy of cannabis businesses in the eyes of regulators, as reported by Cryptonews.com.",2019-03-06
" A recent announcement by US-based cryptocurrency lending startup BlockFi has triggered somewhat contradicting reactions in the crypto community.  The company has introduced BlockFi Interest Account (BIA), or new saving accounts for Bitcoin and Ether with an industry-high 6% annual interest rate (traditional banks in the US offer roughly 2% interest on the saving accounts) paid monthly in cryptocurrency. On one hand, getting 6% (well, rates are subject to change) in a receding bear market sounds like a solid deal, but on the other, it means that you lose control of your private keys.  Today on #cryptotwitter pic.twitter.com/utT0T1AA67 According to Anthony Pompliano, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, a digital asset management firm that invested in BlockFi in 2018, the BIA product has been in private testing for a few weeks, with more than USD10 million already deposited by retail and institutional customers.  Aside from the extra counterparty risk, cryptocurrency saving and lending ventures are attractive for the investors because you get to keep your cryptocurrency while earning additional funds with it at the same time. Besides, BlockFi states that you can take your cryptocurrency back at any time, while the only trade-off is your private keys. me contemplating whether or not to lend my bitcoin and collect a yield or just sit on them for all eternity pic.twitter.com/gL8X2lpEtK No risk, no yield 🤷‍♂️Also, holding most of your coins and lending some of them out are not mutually exclusive In either case, BlockFi, which managed to raise over USD 58 million in venture capital, claims that the launch of the new service was marked by the influx of new users.  The volume on our site from the BlockFi Interest Account launch has been insane. Thanks to everyone for the overwhelming feedback. 2019 is going to be a fun year. The platform also supports XRP and Litecoin, but it remains to be seen if saving accounts will roll out for these tokens. Meanwhile, although cryptocurrency lending and saving services are quite common, the compound interest deals have a dodgy history in the space. The most famous failed high-yield compound interest cryptocurrency project was Bitconnect, a project which made a ridiculous promise of 1% daily compound interest for the investors and was exposed as a Ponzi scheme, causing investors to lose millions.

" Yesterday, we discussed important supports for bitcoin above USD 3,660. BTC/USD formed a support base and later started an upward move above the USD 3,750 and USD 3,800 resistance levels. The price is now (UTC 08:10 AM) trading in a bullish zone and it could test the USD 3,900 and USD 4,000 resistance levels. Ethereum price also gained traction and broke the USD 130 and USD 132 resistance levels. ETH/USD broke the USD 135 resistance and it could extend upsides towards USD 140. Ripple price also traded higher, but upsides were contained by the USD 0.315 resistance level. Total market capitalization  There was a strong bullish wave in bitcoin price  above the USD 3,750 resistance. BTC/USD surged above the USD 3,780 and USD 3,800 resistance levels. The price is currently up more than 3%, with an immediate resistance at USD 3,880 and USD 3,900. If the price continue to move higher, it could rally towards the USD 3,950 and USD 4,000 levels. 
On the other hand, if there is a downside correction, the USD 3,800 level might act as a support. The next supports are near the USD 3,780 and USD 3,750 levels. Ethereum price  rallied more than 7% and broke the USD 130 and USD 132 resistance levels. ETH/USD is currently trading above USD 135 and it seems like buyers are aiming for the USD 140 resistance level.
A break above the USD 140 resistance could push the price towards USD 144. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 134, below which the price could revisit the USD 130 - USD 132 support area. Bitcoin cash price  bounced back from the USD 120 support. BCH/USD broke the USD 128 and USD 130 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. The next key resistance is at USD 132, followed by USD 135.
EOS  surged more than 14% and broke many resistances such as USD 3.40, USD 3.50 and USD 3.65. The price is trading above the USD 3.70 level and it seems like there could be more gains towards the USD 3.85 resistance in the near term.
Ripple price  traded above the USD 0.308 and USD 0.310 resistance levels and overcame selling pressure. However, XRP/USD seems to be facing a strong resistance near the USD 0.314 and USD 0.315 levels, above which it could retest USD 0.320. In the past three sessions, many small cap altcoins rallied and a few gains more than 10%, including BTG, ABBC, ENJ, AOA, DGTX, QNT, THETA, ONT and XIN. Out of these, BTG rallied more than 21% and ABBC is up close to 20%. Overall, bitcoin moved back in a positive zone, with a close above the USD 3,800 resistance level. The current price action is positive and it seems like BTC could attempt to surpass the USD 3,900 and USD 3,950 resistance levels in the coming sessions.

" There were further losses in bitcoin price below the USD 3,750 and USD 3,700 support levels. BTC/USD tested the USD 3,660 - USD 3,670 support and later corrected above the USD 3,700 level. The price is currently consolidating above key supports, but there is a solid resistance formed near USD 3,800. Similarly, ethereum price tested the USD 120 - USD 122 support zone and corrected above USD 125. Ripple also corrected higher after testing the USD 0.2980 support zone. The market sentiment slightly improved, but to start a decent rebound, bitcoin must move above the USD 3,800 resistance. Total market capitalization  There was an extended slide below the USD 3,700 support in bitcoin price . The BTC/USD pair tested the USD 3,660 - USD 3,670 support area and later bounced back. The price is currently (UTC 08:10 AM) trading above USD 3,720, with an immediate resistance near the USD 3,750 level. 
However, the main resistance is near the USD 3,800 level, above which the price could move into a positive trend. On the downside, the USD 3,660 support area is significant. Should sellers push the price below USD 3,600, there could be more losses towards the USD 3,550 level. Ethereum price  declined below the USD 125 pivot level and tested the USD 120 - USD 122 support zone. ETH/USD corrected higher and moved above the USD 125 resistance. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 128, followed by USD 130.
On the downside, the USD 125 level is an initial support. The main support is near the USD 120 - USD 122 zone, where buyers could continue to fight. Therefore, there are high chances of a recovering in ETH as long as the price is above USD 120. Bitcoin cash price  declined below the USD 125 support and tested the USD 120 zone. BCH/USD found support at USD 120 and recently corrected above the USD 124 level. The next key resistance is at USD 128, above which the price could test the USD 130 resistance.
EOS  fell after it broke the USD 3.50 support level. It declined below the USD 3.40 and USD 3.25 support levels. A low was formed near the USD 3.10 level and the price is currently correcting above the USD 3.20 level.
Ripple price  spiked below the USD 0.300 support level and tested the USD 0.298 support. XRP/USD recovered later and moved above the USD 0.302 resistance. The next resistance awaits near the USD 0.305 and USD 0.308 levels. In the past two sessions, a few small cap altcoins rebounded and gained more than 7%, including NEXO, ENJ, BNB, HT, AOA and BAT. Out of these, NEXO rallied more than 20% and ENJ is up close to 15%. Overall, bitcoin recovered from the USD 3,670 support level. However, BTC buyers need to gain clear the USD 3,750 and USD 3,800 resistance level to start a substantial upward move. If not, there could be a fresh decline in bitcoin and altcoins in the near term.

" This past week, bitcoin struggled near a few important resistances such as USD 3,850 and USD 3,900. BTC/USD failed to climb above the USD 3,900 resistance and finally started a downward move. The price broke the key support at USD 3,800 to move into the red zone. Similarly, ethereum price failed to climb above the USD 138 and USD 140 resistance levels, resulting in a drop below the USD 132 and USD 130 support levels. Ripple price also trimmed most its gains and declined below the USD 0.315 and USD 0.308 support levels. The current price action is bearish and it seems like there could be more losses in bitcoin and altcoins before buyers take a strong stand in the coming days. Total market capitalization  After many failed attempts near the USD 3,900 resistance, bitcoin price  started a strong decline. BTC/USD broke the key USD 3,820 and USD 3,800 support levels to enter a bearish zone. Sellers even pushed the price below the USD 3,750 support level. 
The price is currently (UTC 10:20 AM) down more than 2%, with an immediate support at USD 3,700. The next key weekly support is at USD 3,650, below which the price could tumble towards the USD 3,540 support. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the USD 3,800 level. If there is a clear break above USD 3,800, the price could revisit the USD 3,900 resistance. The main weekly resistance for buyers is near the USD 4,000 level. Ethereum price  topped near the USD 140 resistance and declined heavily. ETH/USD broke the USD 132 and USD 130 support levels to start a short-term downtrend.

Bitcoin cash  fell significantly after it failed to stay above the USD 140 support. BCH/USD is down more than 6% and it recently broke the USD 126 and 125 supports. The next immediate support is at USD 122 and USD 120.
EOS  gained bearish momentum and declined more than 8% to breach the USD 3.50 and USD 3.40 support levels. The price is trading below USD 3.30 and it could soon test the USD 3.20 support level.
Ripple price  also followed a bearish pattern and broke the USD 0.320, USD 0.315 and USD 0.308 support levels. XRP/USD is now approaching the USD 0.300 support, below which the next support is at USD 0.292. The main resistances are at USD 0.308 and USD 0.310. During the past few sessions, many small cap altcoins traded lower and fell more than 8%, including THETA, KMD, ELF, HOT, ONT, ETP, STEEM, ICX, MANA, ARK and DGTX. Out of these, THETA is down around 13% and KMD declined roughly 11%. Overall, the crypto market moved into the red zone, with a close below USD 3,800 in bitcoin. There could be a short-term upside correction, but buyers are likely to struggle near USD 3,800 and USD 3,820. Going forward, there could be more losses in BTC and altcoins before buyers reappear.

" After a rebound, bitcoin price started trading in a range above the USD 3,800 support. There are a few positive signs emerging on charts, but BTC/USD must break the USD 3,850 and USD 3,880 resistance levels to gain bullish momentum in the near term. Similarly, ethereum price is holding the USD 135 support and it could make another attempt to clear the USD 138 and USD 140 resistance levels. On the other hand, ripple price already moved higher by more than 3% and broke the USD 0.315 and USD 0.316 resistance levels. Total market capitalization  There were positive moves in bitcoin price  above the USD 3,780 and USD 3,800 support levels.

The next key resistances are near the USD 3,880 and USD 3,900 levels.
On the other hand, if buyers fail to break the stated resistance levels, the price could break the USD 3,800 support area. The next main support is near the USD 3,750 level, below which the price could revisit the USD 3,680 support. Ethereum price  rebounded after a sharp drop below the USD 130 level. ETH/USD is currently consolidating above the USD 135 support and it seems like it could soon test the USD 138 and USD 140 resistance levels.
If buyers clear the USD 140 barrier, there could be more upsides towards the USD 145 level. On the downside, a break below the USD 135 support may push the price towards the USD 132 level. Bitcoin cash price  is struggling to stay above the USD 130 support level. If there is a bearish break below USD 130, BCH/USD could accelerate losses towards the USD 125 support. On the upside, the main resistance is at USD 134 - USD 135.
EOS  retested the USD 3.50 support level and it is currently trading in a range. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 3.60, followed by 3.65. The key supports are USD 3.50 and USD 3.42.

" After stressing that Bitcoin is ""trying to solve a problem that does not exist"" a year ago, Lisa Ellis, a top Wall Street analyst focused on the payments industry, now says that cryptocurrencies ""are potentially disruptive to private payment systems."" In a note to clients, Ellis, who is a partner at MoffettNathanson, a sell-side research boutique, wrote that the existential threat of cryptocurrency as a globally accepted, unbranded payment system that upends incumbents like Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal is worth watching but is unlikely to occur soon, Bloomberg reported. The threat should not be ignored, as progress is steadily being made to address shortcomings and compelling use cases emerge, it added.  While Ellis also sees another risk of ceding the cross-border person-to-person and business-to-business payments markets to players such as Ripple and Veem, a global payments platform, she noted that cryptocurrencies and blockchain could open up new revenue streams for the incumbents, such as combining the networks’ authentication abilities with blockchain technology for tracking. Meanwhile, last January, in an interview with CNBC, Ellis said that Bitcoin is trying to solve a problem that does not exist. ""The consumer payment system actually works pretty well today and is remarkably efficient. <...> The trust embeded in the existing payment systems would be very difficult to replicate elsewhere for sure,"" she said back then.  In a more recent interview, last July, she admitted that ""Bitcoin is the only disruptive risk in the sense that it is bringing whole new type of payments system that is unbranded, public and decentralized."" Last October, CEO of Visa, Al Kelly, said that he “certainly” does not view cryptocurrencies as a threat to his business right now, but added that “if we have to go there, we’ll go there.” Meanwhile, last July, MasterCard was reportedly working on a solution to speed up crypto transactions to make them more feasible for merchants to accept from consumers. When it comes to PayPal, their CFO John Rainey told CNBC in May 2018 that they don’t see much interest in cryptocurrencies due to volatility threatening the viability of their merchants’ businesses. However, he did not rule out that the payment giant will support crypto in the future. As reported by Cryptonews.com last December, Bitcoin was being used in commerce at a relatively steady rate last year. However, the recent note by Ellis is not the only sign of the changing attitude towards crypto. Earlier in February, Cambridge Associates, a major consultant for pensions and endowments, said that institutional investors should look more into cryptocurrencies. According to a research note, the consultant thinks that, “Though these investments entail a high degree of risk, some may very well upend the digital world.”",2019-02-28
" In the past two days, we saw bearish moves in bitcoin and altcoins. BTC/USD broke the USD 3,800 support, but it found a strong support near USD 3,750. A fresh recovery was initiated recently and the price corrected above USD 3,800. However, the price must break the USD 3,850 and USD 3,900 resistance levels to stage a comeback. Similarly, it seems like ethereum price is approaching the key USD 142 resistance, above which ETH/USD could rise to USD 150. Ripple declined from well above USD 0.330 and settled below USD 0.320. It is currently (UTC 08:10 AM) consolidating and there could be a decent recovery towards the USD 0.320 and USD 0.322 resistance levels. Total market capitalization  Recently, bitcoin price  formed a decent support base near the USD 3,750 level. BTC/USD started a steady upside correction and moved above the USD 3,800 level. However, there are key resistances waiting near USD 3,850 and USD 3,900 levels, which are likely to stop the current wave.
Should buyers clear the USD 3,900 resistance, the price could rebound in the near term. Conversely, a failure to move past the USD 3,850 and USD 3,900 resistance levels may trigger a fresh bearish wave. Ethereum price  is slowly gaining pace and it recently broke the USD 138 resistance. ETH/USD is up around 1.2% and it could continue to move higher towards the USD 140 and USD 142 resistance levels.
If buyers fail to gain strength above the USD 140 and USD 142 resistance levels, the price is likely to dive again towards the USD 130 support level in the near term. Bitcoin cash price  seems to be forming a support base above the USD 130 and USD 132 levels. BCH/USD must break the USD 135 and USD 138 resistance levels to start a short term rebound towards USD 145.
EOS  tested the USD 3.30 support and later bounced back. The price is currently trading above the USD 3.50 resistance and it may continue to rise towards the USD 3.65 and USD 3.70 resistance levels.
Ripple price  failed to hold yesterday’s rally and declined heavily below the USD 0.325 and USD 0.320 supports. XRP/USD is trading below USD 0.320 and it could continue to struggle in the short term unless buyers push the price back above USD 0.320. In the past couple of sessions, a few small cap altcoins climbed higher and gained more than 10%, including MANA, THETA, ABBC, ODE, VERI, AION, ELF, RVN and ARK. Out of these, MANA rallied more than 28% and THETA is up around 26%. The current price action indicates that bitcoin could correct higher in the short term towards USD 3,850 or 3,900. However, BTC/USD must gain pace above USD 3,900 to continue higher. If not, there could be a fresh decline in BTC price and altcoins in the coming sessions.

" Yesterday, we saw how bitcoin and altcoins trimmed gains and broke key supports. BTC/USD tested the USD 3,700 - USD 3,720 support zone and later started an upside correction. However, buyers struggled near the USD 3,850 and USD 3,860 resistance levels. As a result, there was a fresh decline and it seems like the price may test the USD 3,750 or USD 3,720 support levels. Ethereum too failed to recover above key resistances near USD 142 and later declined. On the other hand, ripple price rallied after the Coinbase Pro exchange announced that they will launch XRP trading on February 26, 2019. It sparked bullish moves above in XRP/USD, but the pair failed to hold gains above the USD 0.320 support level. Total market capitalization  After testing the USD 3,700 - USD 3,720 support zone, bitcoin price  started a decent upside correction. BTC/USD rebounded above the USD 3,800 resistance, but buyers failed to gain pace above the USD 3,850 and USD 3,860 resistance levels. The price started a fresh bearish wave and tested the USD 3,800 level.
If sellers remain in action, the price could revisit the USD 3,750 or USD 3,720 support levels. A downside break below the USD 3,720 support may perhaps accelerate losses. On the flip side, a break above USD 3,850 and USD 3,900 is needed for further upsides. Ethereum price  settled below the key USD 142 support, which is now (UTC 08:10 AM) acting as a resistance. ETH/USD recently made an attempt to clear the USD 142 resistance, but it failed.
The price is currently trading above the USD 135 support, below which it could decline towards the USD 130 support in the coming sessions. Bitcoin cash price  faced an increased selling pressure below the USD 140 resistance. On the other hand Bitcoin SV rallied recently and climbed more than 15% above the USD 70 resistance. More gains are possible if the price climbs above the USD 75 level.
EOS  is down more than 2% today and it is currently trading below the USD 3.80 and USD 3.60 support levels. The next main support is at USD 3.30, where buyers are likely to take a stand prevent more losses.
Ripple price  performed really well and rallied above the USD 0.315 and USD 0.320 resistance. XRP/USD even broke the USD 0.330 resistance, but it failed to hold gains and it is currently trading below the USD 0.320 pivot level, with a bearish angle. Despite recent bearish moves in bitcoin and ethereum, a few small cap altcoins gained traction and rallied more than 10%, including ENJ, BAT, S4F, LOOM, BSV, ICX, STEEM, ELF, and RVN. Out of these, ENJ rallied more than 130% and BAT is up around 38%. Overall, bitcoin price is under a lot of pressure below the USD 3,850 and USD 3,900 resistance levels. Therefore, there are chances of more losses in BTC below the USD 3,750 support, which may spark bearish moves in ethereum and other altcoins.

" Crypto community is disturbed by the brutal robbery attempt in the Netherlands. On February 10, three armed robbers with police vests broke into a residential building and tortured 38 years old Bitcoin trader for over an hour using a drill, reported the biggest Dutch news portal De Telegraaf. According to the report, all this happened in front of his terrified four-year-old daughter. The victim was seriously injured and is now being treated in a hospital. The motive for the robbery is unknown, but the victim was known to be wealthy and involved in Bitcoin trading.  Although the police refused to disclose any extra details, rumor has it that the assailants did not manage to force the person to give them access his Bitcoin holdings.  Now, fifteen Dutch police officers are investigating the robbery which happened in a small village of Dourwenerveen, Drenthe. The police report that it is not the first brutal robbery attempt in the Drenthe province, but it is one of the first cases where attackers targeted Dutch digital asset holders. The nature of digital assets makes them easily transferable, immutable and somewhat anonymous. The traders who hold sizeable amounts and are vocal about it are easy targets for both online scammers and real-life burglars. Such a disturbing event is a reminder to the crypto community to maintain low-profile when it comes to crypto investments.  Meanwhile, according to Bitcoin pioneer and cryptographer Nick Szabo, firearms are critical security instruments when it comes to protecting yourself offline. Firearms are among the most important and effective security devices when it comes to key management.  Don't split multisig authority among just anybody. Distribute control over the family coins among people who can deter theft with rapid fire and steady hands. His comment has sparked a debate among the cryptocurrency holders and whether firearms would have changed anything in this particular case. In either case, it is not the first time when Bitcoin and cryptocurrency holders become victims of a robbery. Crypto robberies at gunpoint and kidnappings of wealthy digital asset holders have been happening throughout 2018.

" Cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex has received 27.66270285 Bitcoin  from the US government, which they had initially lost in the August 2016 hack, as the result of US law enforcement efforts. These are now being converted to USD and paid to RRT (Recovery Right Token) Holders. Back in August 2016, 119,756 BTC was stolen from Bitfinex (at the time worth around USD 73 million). The now-returned amount totals about USD 110,000 at today’s prices, which law enforcement managed to retrieve in November 2018. “Since the well documented hack in 2016, Bitfinex has collaborated with international law enforcement agencies to provide intelligence and assist with investigations. Bitfinex was alerted in November 2018 that the US government had obtained bitcoins believed to be proceeds from the 2016 hack,” the exchange announced in an blog post. Giancarlo Devasini, Chief Financial Officer at Bitfinex said, “Over two years following the hack of the Bitfinex platform, today we see the results of a clear and robust response strategy and the efforts of the US government. It gives us great pleasure to be able to reimburse our traders that were loyal to us and believed in us at a very difficult time.” CEO of crypto investments firm CoinShares, Ryan Radloff, reacted: Interesting to see the US government interacting directly with bitfinex in this way, in many ways this legitimizes bitfinex as an institution by being on receiving end of a transaction from US gvmtIf US GVMT was severely worried about bitfinex &/or teather this wouldn’t happen https://t.co/Ehcfj6qMmy In 2016, Bitfinex told customers affected by the hack to accept a loss of up to 36% of their holdings compensating them with tokens of credit. Bitfinex then created a digital token called BFXcoin, which was issued to users equaling their personal losses. These tokens had a value of 1 BFX to 1 dollar lost and could be later traded in for repayment by the exchange. Within eight months, all BFXcoin holders had their tokens redeemed at this rate, says the exchange. “All BFX tokens were destroyed within this process. Additionally, Bitfinex created a tradable Recovery Right Token (RRT) for BFX holders that converted BFX tokens into shares of iFinex,” Bitfinex explains. “As all BFX tokens have been redeemed and destroyed, the full amount of recovered bitcoins today is being distributed pro rata to the RRT holders.” Top markets on Bitfinex:",2019-02-25
" Recently, Jesse Lund, Head of Blockchain & Digital Currencies at IBM, said that he expects Bitcoin to get to “a million dollars someday.” Now, controversial entrepreneur and Bitcoin bull John McAfee is miffed that others are repeating what he considers his own prediction and reminds the community that he’s the only one who set a date for this price: by the end of 2020. “People are waking up to the fact that Bitcoin will be USD 1,000,000. But when? ‘Someday.’ ‘Maybe 5 years.’ ‘Within a decade.’  I'm the only one giving you a hard date: Dec 31st, 2020,” he wrote in reply to the news of Lund making his prediction. Later, he followed up by tweeting, “Jesus! The media yet again! ‘By Dec. 31. 2020,’ is not an exact date. Let's all be clear again: I predicted Bitcoin would reach USD 1,000,000 before the end of 2020. That is not saying it will hit that price on that date.” This updates (and in effect doubles down on) his previous bet, made in July 2017, that Bitcoin price would move above USD 500,000 in three years. McAfee famously claimed that if he lost that bet he would eat his own penis on national television. When questioned in the Twitter comments, McAfee confirmed that this was the same bet, and that: “I never lose a bet.” However, he has also previously tried to back out a bit, perhaps realizing how that bet sounded: “If the worst comes and I lose my Bitcoin bet (keep in mind I promised to eat my dick. The cutting it off first was added by the media), I will probably subcontract the task to a relay team of Bangkok prostitutes with instructions to carry out the task slowly, finishing as I exit,” he tweeted in December last year. McAfee’s word may carry more weight than intended as he has announced his intent to run for president of the United States with the Libertarian Party for the second time. He has also revealed that he is being pursued by the Internal Revenue Service, for “unspecified crimes,” and living in exile.  And while the extravagant presidential candidate is trying to reassert his dominance as the most relevant price predictor, the prices are not really cooperating. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at USD 3,839.64, following a turbulent market which saw it jump to almost USD 4,200. Also, there is a website, bircoin.top that follows McAfee’s prediction and measures how much Bitcoin would have to rise for McAfee’s nethers to stay intact:",2019-02-25
" The past weekend has once again seen crypto prices fluctuate wildly, and along with it market sentiment has also shifted from previously bearish, to cautiously optimistic, before a dose of frustration set in on Sunday. February has been a good month for cryptocurrencies so far, with significant gains seen on the 8th, the 18th, and the 23rd. At the highest point on Sunday, bitcoin was up more than 22% for the month, an increase from around USD 3,400 on February 1 to almost USD 4,200 on Sunday the 24th. However, the market then entered into correction mode again, selling off roughly 10%, while bringing the price back well below the 4,000-mark. Top 10 coins by market capitalization: (UTC 07:30 AM) Before the sell-off, there were signs that traders had started positioning themselves for higher bitcoin prices, as illustrated by the bitcoin short-to-long ratio falling to low levels not seen since mid-2018. However, it appears that some short-term speculators got overly excited by this shift in sentiment, which resulted in them quickly having to close out their positions when the market turned against them on Sunday. And when the trading volume otherwise is thin, a few big sell orders may be all it takes to ignite a sell-off and cause panic-selling among the short-term speculators, a cycle which then reinforces itself.  Some are also suggesting that trading volume in the bitcoin market may in fact be a lot thinner than we think, which is a nice way to say that the practice among some exchanges of faking trading volume is still very much alive. Today's crypto pump and dump shows how paper thin our sell and buy support really is. I expect this to continue through this year - we have less organic volume than coinmarketcap tells us. pic.twitter.com/Mg9c0BmINM Others, however, are not surprised that the bitcoin market suddenly sold off, arguing that the price was just hitting resistance in the chart from a technical analysis perspective: After a significant run people will always book some profits.  I went to bed with coins and woke up with USDT - first priority after some gains is to protect your wealth with stop losses. From a pure charting perspective, this is a valid point, and we should ideally see a strong break through the resistance area found around USD 4,100 before we can say that the bitcoin price has escaped the current trading range. _____ Other reactions: It's a ""Bart"" Simpson price formation, suspected to be triggered by overuse of leverage eg on @bitmex and other high leveraged platforms. Short-squeeze followed by long squeeze. Is it good for Bitcoin? It's just a market artefact, more liquidity would likely reduce the effect. pic.twitter.com/zKJef6QFUv $BTC 2013-2016 vs 2017-2019 analog comparison.

They will ignore charts that fail and only focus on those that still align with their bias. Currently, bears are becoming a massive majority. In #bitcoin, majority always gets rekt. damn it... guess it time to watch eth/usd again. it appears to have lead the sell off this morning with 16,900 eth being market sold in a 1 minute candle. GDAX has an OTC desk... no idea why you would take that kinda of slippage. pic.twitter.com/H0xcvwnZwx If bitcoin gets back to 3900-4000 in a day or so, how many traders will have outperformed that (basically a 0 return)? I suspect a good chunk of traders got on the bull train late, rode it down too hard, and is now short. Ouch I'm seeing many comparing today's price action with the price action that preceded the 6K crash. Charts are radically different. The only thing these two data points have in common is the presence of one of the majors forking and prices running up into the fork. Whatever you do - have a PLAN. I'm buying the 3700 $BTC pullback. If close below 3700 then I'll cut.Don't copy me though. Instead, create a simple ruleset for yourself.Example: If ""_____"" then I will ""_____"".

" Third strong jump in the crypto market this February just ended as suddenly as it started. In half an hour, sharp correction pushed the whole market below the level it was before the rally that started on Saturday. (Updated on UTC 04:00 PM. Updates throughout the entire text.)

" In the past few sessions, there were mostly range moves in bitcoin price above the USD 3,880 support level. More importantly, BTC/USD continued to face a strong resistance near the USD 3,980 and USD 4,000 levels. If it continues to struggle below USD 4,000, there is a risk of a short-term downside correction below USD 3,900 before a fresh upward move. Similarly, ethereum is struggling (UTC 08:10 AM) to trade past the USD 150 resistance and it could correct below the USD 140 support. Ripple price already broke the USD 0.322 and USD 0.320 support levels to move into a bearish zone. Total market capitalization  There seems to be a strong sell wall formed near the USD 4,000 level for bitcoin price . BTC/USD made a couple of attempts to surpass the USD 3,980 and USD 4,000 resistance levels, but it failed to gain traction. The price is currently trading below the USD 3,950 support, with a bearish angle. 
If sellers gain momentum below the USD 3,900 support, there could be additional losses below the USD 3,880 support in the short term. The next stop for sellers could be USD 3,800, where buyers could emerge. Ethereum price  also struggled to climb above the USD 148 and USD 150 resistance levels. ETH/USD slipped below the USD 146 level and it seems like there could be more losses towards the USD 140 support.
Below USD 140, the price could turn bearish in the short term and it may trade towards the USD 132 support. On the upside, a convincing break above the USD 150 resistance is needed for more gains. Bitcoin cash price  declined below the USD 145 support level and it could continue to move down towards the USD 140 support. Should there be more declines, the next key support is at USD 134. On the upside, there are many hurdles near USD 146, USD 148 and USD 150.
EOS  is still positioned above key supports at USD 3.75 and USD 3.80. Therefore, there are chances of more gains above the USD 3.85 and USD 3.90 resistance levels in the near term.
Ripple price  failed to gain traction and traded below key supports at USD 0.322 and USD 0.320. XRP/USD tested the 0.315 support and it is currently correcting higher. It must move past USD 0.322 to start a fresh upward move. In the past few hours, a few small cap altcoins corrected lower by more than 6%, including REPO, KMD, MCO, PPT, LINK, FCT and TOMO. Out of these, REPO declined more than 9% and KMD is down close to 8%. The current price action is slightly bearish below USD 3,980 for bitcoin, which may result in more losses in the near term. BTC/USD could test the USD 3,800 and it is likely to make another attempt to surpass the USD 4,000 resistance.

" Jesse Lund, Head of Blockchain & Digital Currencies at IBM, just made the wildly bullish prediction that he sees bitcoin “at a million dollars someday.” “Let me just say this, I have a long-term outlook […] and it goes back to the discussion about the utility of the network leading to a higher price, so I see bitcoin at a million dollar someday,” he said in a recent interview with Finder.com at IBM’s Think 2019 event.  “If bitcoin is at a million dollars, then a satoshi [1 BTC = 100M satoshis] is at value parity with a US penny, and that means there’s over 20 trillion dollars of liquidity in this network […] Think about how that changes things like corporate payments,” Lund, who previously worked with US banking giant Wells Fargo, explained. In the interview, which covered a range of topics related to blockchain technology and IBM’s work in the field, Lund was also asked where he believed the bitcoin price would be on New Year’s Eve 2019, to which he replied that he sees USD 5,000 as a likely target by year-end. Bitcoin price chart: Asked about his personal view of the potential of blockchain technology, Lund also offered his insights:  “I think the landscape of banking, of lending, and payments, it’s going to radically change,” he said, before adding “50 years from now, we’re gonna look back and say ‘paper money, what was that?’” In the past, Cryptonews.com has also reported that IBM has been backing and exploring uses for a stablecoin project named Stronghold, the first stablecoin to launch on the Stellar network.  “IBM will explore use cases with business networks that we have developed, as a user of the token. We see this as a way of bringing financial settlement into the transactional business network that we have been building,” Jesse Lund was quoted as telling Reuters at the time. Separetely, in an interview with Cryptonews.com Maciek Jędrzejczyk, Blockchain Leader for Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) at IBM, said that instead of focusing on blockchain as a technology, people should be focusing more on letting it resolve real business problems. Also, expecting blockchain to solve any and all problems you have is a common pitfall in the industry: “You have to be aware of the limitations of the technology, and you need to let your clients know,” he explains.

" There were mostly range moves in bitcoin price below the USD 4,000 resistance level. BTC/USD recovered from the USD 3,900 support, but it struggled to break the USD 3,980 and USD 4,000 resistance levels. It seems like there could be a minor decline towards the USD 3,920 and USD 3,900 supports before the price attempts to break the USD 4,000 resistance. Similarly, there were a few bearish moves in ethereum and ripple, but both rebounded and challenged key resistances at USD 150 and USD 0.330 respectively.  Total market capitalization  There was another attempt by bitcoin price  to gain strength above the USD 4,000 resistance. However, BTC/USD failed near USD 4,020 and later corrected lower. It moved below the USD 3,960 support and it seems like there could be an extended downside correction towards the USD 3,920 and uSD 3,900 support levels.
On the upside, the USD 3,980 level is an initial resistance followed by USD 4,000. A successful hourly and 2-hour close above the USD 4,000 resistance is required for buyers to gain bullish momentum in the near term. Ethereum price  bounced back above the USD 145 level, with a bullish angle. However, ETH/USD seems to be facing a strong resistance (UTC 08:10 AM) near the USD 148 and USD 150 levels.
A clear break above the USD 150 resistance will most likely clear the path for more gains towards the USD 156 and USD 160 levels. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 145, below which the price could test the USD 142 support. Bitcoin cash price  is correcting lower from the USD 148 resistance area. BCH/USD declined below USD 145 and it seems like the price may test the USD 140 support in the near term. On the upside, the broken USD 145 level will most likely act as a resistance, followed by USD 148.
EOS  performed well recently and gained more than 6%. The price surpassed the USD 2.75 resistance and tested the USD 2.85 level, where sellers emerged.
Ripple price  stayed above the USD 0.315 support and recovered above the USD 0.325 resistance. However, XRP/USD faced a strong resistance near the USD 0.330 level and it is currently declining towards the USD 0.325 and USD 0.322 support levels. In the past few hours, many small cap altcoins traded higher between 6%-25%, including REPO, MCO, ONT, TOMO, ELF, STRAT, DGB and FCT. Out of these, REPO gained more than 20% and MCO is up close to 15%. Overall, bitcoin price is well supported above the USD 3,900 level, with a bullish angle. However, BTC/USD must break the USD 4,000 level to climb further higher. If buyers continue to struggle, there could be a short-term pullback in bitcoin and altcoins in the coming sessions.

" While the avant-garde of the cryptoverse is abuzz with a new app, Tippin, for Chrome and Firefox browsers that lets you tip a certain tweet with Bitcoin, social network giant Twitter has no plans to integrate it, a spokesperson confirmed to Cryptonews.com. (Reaction from the Twitter CEO has been added) “Twitter does not control anything to do with third party browser extensions. This is entirely independent from Twitter.com and there are no plans to integrate it site wide that I am aware of,” according to the spokesperson.  Developer of the app, Sergio Abril, did not respond to requests for comment. However, after this article was published, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted that he ""already got tipped some satoshis"" with Tippin. The CEO did not elaborate any further. pic.twitter.com/KKeymACOw8 The beta app has released a new Chrome Extension as well as a Firefox extension available for users of these browsers. Over Twitter, app users can send Bitcoin payments via the Lightning Network, making for faster and more scalable transactions. With the extension enabled, a little lightning bolt symbol pops up inside every tweet next to the more familiar “like” and “retweet” buttons. 🤭 The Chrome extension that places a https://t.co/NVpjMUDdfJ button in every Tweet is here.https://t.co/Ra3de5dr50#LightningNetwork #LNTrustChain pic.twitter.com/FIx5zBbZfb All a user needs is a Twitter account, a Lightning network wallet, Tippin and, of course, some bitcoin. The app hopes to foster adoption and growth in the crypto ecosystem through crypto enthusiasts that predominantly use Twitter. Some of them are already sharing their experience how to start tipping with Bitcoin on Twitter. According to Firefox data, 27 of its users downloaded the app, while Chrome is a more popular option with 282 users. The announcement made by Tippin comes just after Jack Dorsey shared his support for Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. He says that he loves the idea of having a world where it is possible to tip people with satoshis, the smallest unit of the bitcoin, for their tweets. He has also said that bitcoin tipping using the Lightning Network on Twitter is a “really compelling” idea. ""It’s something that we want to spend a lot more time on,” Dorsey said, adding that there is “a pretty active conversation within the company” and that they want to be “smart about it.” At the same time, the CEO participated in the Lightning Network torch initiative. Bitcoin users have been passing around a so-called Lightning Torch, which is a game wherein each participant adds a little bitcoin to a payment, then passes it onto someone on Twitter that they trust, in order to spread awareness of the second-layer Lightning Network technology. Meanwhile, when bitcoin first started to gather more attention in online forums and on social media, one of the most talked about use cases for the digital currency was online micropayments. Not too long after, the first bitcoin tipping bot was launched, which enabled social media users to tip each other in small amounts of bitcoin. Read about crypto tipping bots here.",2019-02-20
" Recently, we saw a strong increase in bitcoin price above the USD 3,750 and USD 3,800 resistance levels. BCT/USD even broke the USD 3,950 resistance and traded close to the USD 4,000 barrier before correcting lower. The price dipped below the USD 3,900 level, but the USD 3,860 level acted as a decent support. Similarly, there were bearish moves in ethereum below the USD 145 support. ETH/USD tested the USD 140 support area and it is currently  (UTC 08:20 AM) consolidating gains. Ripple price also corrected lower, but it stayed above the key USD 0.315 support area.  Total market capitalization  After a solid upward move, bitcoin price  failed to surpass the USD 3,980 - USD 4,000 resistance area. BTC/USD corrected lower and traded below the USD 3,950 and USD 3,900 support levels. However, the USD 3,860 provided a decent support and the price rebounded above USD 3,900.
On the upside, the USD 3,950 level is an initial resistance followed by USD 3,980. A successful break above USD 4,000 is must for further acceleration. On the other hand, if the price breaks the USD 3,860 support, there could be an extended decline towards the USD 3,780 support. Ethereum price  topped near the USD 150 level and later corrected below the USD 145 and USD 142 support levels. ETH/USD tested the USD 140 support and it is currently down 3% to USD 143.
Buyers need to gain strength above USD 145 to challenge the USD 150 resistance. If they fail to gain momentum, there is a risk of more losses below the USD 140 support. Bitcoin cash price  spiked above the USD 150 and USD 151 levels before starting a downside correction. BCH/USD declined below USD 145 and tested the USD 138 level, where buyers appeared. It is currently trading above USD 140, with resistances near USD 145 and USD 148.
EOS  remained in the positive zone and there was hardly any major downside correction from the USD 3.80 swing high. The price is trading near the USD 3.62 level, with a positive angle towards USD 2.70 and USD 2.80.
Ripple price  trimmed its recent gains and traded below the USD 0.325 and USD 0.320 support levels. XRP/USD found support near USD 0.315 and later bounced back above USD 0.322. It must accelerate above USD 0.330 and USD 0.332 to rise again in the near term. Despite a downside correction in bitcoin and ethereum, a few small cap altcoins gained traction, including STROJ, BNB, MKR, WAX, THETA, QNT and KMD. Out of these, STORJ gained more than 20% and BNB is up close to 16%.
The current price action is slightly bearish, but bitcoin price remains supported above the USD 3,860 and USD 3,780 levels. Having said that, BTC/USD must gain strength above USD 3,950, USD 3,980 and USD 4,000 to start a fresh upward move in the coming sessions. If not, there is a risk of an extended correction in bitcoin and altcoins.

" PayPal, SpaceX and Tesla founder, tech hero Elon Musk said that he believes “the Bitcoin structure is quite brilliant” and crypto is a far better way to transfer value.  However, in an interview on the podcast hosted by financial advisory and investment firm ARK Invest, a Tesla shareholder, Musk also said that “I’m not sure if it would be a good use of Tesla resources to get involved in crypto. We’re just really trying to accelerate the advance of sustainable energy.” “It’s interesting, I have some friends that are really bold in crypto,” Musk said, partly referring to Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey who recently said that he believes bitcoin may become “the native currency of the Internet.” However, Musk also touched on what he views as the downsides of crypto, saying that “computationally it is quite energy intensive.” “There have to be some kind of constraints on the creation of crypto. But it's very energy intensive to create the incremental bitcoin at this point,” Musk said in the interview. In the wide-ranging interview, Musk also discussed the possibilities that exist for crypto to revolutionize financial transactions in Africa. Here, business-to-business transactions across borders remains “prohibitively expensive” because of the difficulties with converting one African currency to another, according to the show hosts. To this point, Musk agreed, saying that “it bypasses currency controls,” before he added that “paper money is going away, and crypto is a far better way to transfer value than pieces of paper, that’s for sure.” In the past, Elon Musk has frequently been impersonated by scammers on Twitter involving cryptocurrency. When asked early last year where all the spam comes from, Musk responded “Not sure. I let @jack (Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey) know, but it’s still going.

" In the cryptoverse, where we’re all looking for signs of increased adoption with bated breath, even the smallest things can bring hype. Today we have a new one - it seems that almost everyone in the cryptoland is checking their iPhones for the Bitcoin symbol.  It looks like the Google keyboard on iPhones now has a Bitcoin sign when you long press the dollar sign, among all the other currencies. However, no one knows when exactly it was added and why Google's product is not available on Android phones. To access it, make sure you’re using the Google keyboard, not just the default Apple one, and hold down the dollar symbol to see a pop up of several of the world’s major currency symbols. The Bitcoin symbol is located on the far left. Although the symbol shares some similarities with the Thai Baht currency, the Baht has a single line all the way through - as opposed to Bitcoin’s two lines at the top and bottom of the capital B. Wow I just noticed that the ₿ symbol is now the first currency when u long press $ on Google keyboard...Does everyone know this? Bitcoin is becoming pervasive everywhere @APompliano pic.twitter.com/2hWDuBit3X Yes - UK pic.twitter.com/JlEokzDi40 True, for US and Swiss/French keyboard. pic.twitter.com/YgAd3XbpRr Of course. But the news is not about how easy or difficult it is to write it, but rather the importance that Bitcoin has taken in everyday life which motivates a giant like Google to integrate it alongside $ , ¥, and € on a mainstream software. Some enthusiasts have taken this to mean that adoption is coming - while more extreme ones already see a bull run in the future. Although this may not mean anything, a small sign of endorsement is certainly good, especially with the recent rally. However, this feature is not available on Android phones yet, and there is no indication that it could become available any time soon. Also, not every Google keyboard on iPhone offers this possibility, as users from Scandinavian countries as well as France claimed on Twitter that they could not find the option. Additionally, some users complain that when they click the symbol, it turns into ₱, the symbol for the Philippine Peso - but it is possible that this is just a temporary glitch.  Meanwhile, PC users may not know that they can type the Bitcoin symbol since June 2017, as it is part of the Unicode 10.0, with code point U+20BF (₿). Since only a few fonts contain the Bitcoin symbol, a special font was created by user Theymos, head administrator of the BitcoinTalk forum. The font consists of only the Bitcoin symbol (BTC) used in the glyph for the capital letter B. The text “BTC” can be entered and styled with this font, causing it to be replaced entirely with just the symbol on those systems that support this font, while on other systems the text “BTC” is retained. Similarly, copying and pasting text will still retain “BTC.” This method is used on BitcoinTalk and the Bitcoin Wiki.",2019-02-19
" The bitcoin market may be about to see another wave of buying, one measure of sentiment among traders suggests.  According to data from crypto exchange Bitfinex, the ratio of short-to-long trades in the bitcoin market has hit 0.68 – the lowest level since early August last year. A short-to-long ratio below 1 indicates that there are more traders who believe in higher prices, than those who believe in lower prices.  While a “long trade” involves buying an asset in anticipation that its price will rise, a “short trade” happens when a trader places a bet that the price of an asset will fall, by borrowing the asset and then selling it in the market. The trader’s goal is then to buy back the asset at a lower price later, and pocket the price difference as his profit. During the past six months, we have often reported on this ratio reaching record-high levels as a sign that there may be too many traders positioned on the long side of the trade, which may lead to sharp reversals in the price. This time, however, the ratio is far from extreme levels, suggesting that the recent bitcoin rally may still continue for some time. Bitcoin short-to-long ratio on Bitfinex. The blue horizontal line indicates equilibrium between short and long trades: Meanwhile, the total value of the short trades on Bitfinex has also dropped. More than just indicating that the bullish sentiment has increased, this also suggests that the overall interest in bitcoin trading is picking up.

" Cambridge Associates, a consultant for pensions and endowments, thinks institutional investors should look more into cryptocurrencies. According to a research note published on Monday and reported by Bloomberg, the consultant thinks that, “Though these investments entail a high degree of risk, some may very well upend the digital world.” Boston-based Cambridge Associates, which specializes in pension and endowment consultancy, reportedly works with institutions that collectively manage over USD 300 billion. Assessing the 2018 cryptocurrency market slump, the analysts reportedly argued that the crypto investment landscape as a whole nonetheless demonstrates “an industry that is developing, not faltering.’’ The document advises prospective investors to do their own, thorough research and educate themselves, as well as explore diverse investment routes. Those diverse routes range from illiquid venture capital funds to simply buying tokens on an exchange. Investors often steer clear from the industry due to the 2018 bear market which has left many disillusioned, and the consultancy acknowledges this. However, the note adds that, “Despite the challenges, we believe that it is worthwhile for investors to begin exploring this area today with an eye toward the long term.” Meltem Demirors, a cryptocurrency investor, Chief Strategy Officer at CoinShares, a crypto focused investment company, reacted to the news by tweeting her view on where investors will initially allocate: ""Most will buy structured, regulated products and vehicles that can pass the investment committee's risk review process."" However, some institutionals are already here, as shown by the example of two separate pension funds that collectively manage USD 1.2 billion in assets for the state of Virginia police force and other employees backing a cryptocurrency fund. Pensions on blockchain are far from a new idea, as many players, both startups and established companies, are looking into this possibility.  ""The institutions aren’t coming. They’re already here,"" Anthony Pompliano, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, said last week after the company announced its deal with the pension funds.  There are already ways for investors to dip their toes into crypto without taking on too much risk, like Grayscale Investment offers - “a traditional investment vehicle with shares titled in the investors name, providing a familiar structure for financial and tax advisors and easy transferability to beneficiaries under estate laws” - although their CEOsees altcoins collapse, but remains bullish on Bitcoin. Also, as reported by Cryptonews.com, despite the bear market, crypto and blockchain will continue to appeal to institutional investors through 2019 and beyond, while asset managers most interested in new models for the tokenization and management of traditional securities and other assets Meanwhile, the CEO of futures exchange operator CME Group, Terry Duffy thinks that until governments really start to accept cryptocurrencies of some way, shape, or form, it’s gonna be very difficult for the major institutional investors to tap into crypto. However, in an interview last week, Mike Novogratz, founder and chief executive officer at Galaxy Digital, a digital assets merchant bank, said that ""all the architecture institutions need to feel comfortable with [crypto] is being put in place"" and much-anticipated custody solutions to be launched very soon.

" Following the news of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance delisting another five altcoins due to not meeting “the high level of standard we expect,” the teams behind the delisted projects are responding to the news on their respective platforms. The response is very similar from every team involved and comes down to them saying they’re not happy about it, but they will continue working on their projects. The five altcoins have all come forward with their own announcement following the news. CloakCoin (CLOAK) wrote on their website: “The news on Friday about Cloak being delisted from Binance has emotionally shocked me. As CloakCoin’s project manager this is an even harder hit for me because I very strongly identify myself with the project. Binance is a reputable player in the crypto scene. This unsubstantiated and incomprehensible message tarnishes CloakCoin’s reputation in a negative way [...] Looking back at the regular contact made with Team Binance previously, I hope for a detailed explanation regarding which of the points apply to CloakCoin.” Modum (MOD) is alarmed, but is not making too many explanations for the time being: “We were given no prior notice about this decision and have not received a satisfactory reasoning from Binance yet. We will update the community as early as possible [this] week,” they wrote in their Telegram channel.  Wings (WINGS) had a similar reaction in a blog post: “These news have saddened us, as WINGS has been listed since the early days of Binance. As all the required information by Binance was always provided in a timely manner. The delisting was a big surprise for us, since we have not received any notification about the pending delisting, hence had no chance to resolve any issues they may have found with the project. In fact, up to this very moment we have no information why Wings specifically was picked, despite our repeated inquiries to Binance.” Substratum (SUB) made a more more specific explanation of their grievances against this course of action. “This decision came as a surprise, with no advance warning. We are terribly disappointed in the decision and their handling of the delisting. To be specific: Binance has since indicated that our delisting is due to the trading of ICO funds.  We are attempting to reach out to Binance to provide them with documentation to show that is not the case.” They later add, “The Substratum development team remains focused on delivery and our upcoming release. We will not be deterred or distracted by influences outside of our control. We remain vigilant in pursuing freedom of information to all – true net neutrality.” Salt (SALT) is similarly indignant: “SALT adamantly objects to Binance’s announcement which provides the basis for which it delists a token but does not make any specific allegation against the list of companies, thus creating false negative implications. Binance has not requested any information from SALT to enable Binance to make a decision relating to its now publicly listed criteria and acted irresponsibly in insinuating that any of the criteria is true of SALT.” However, the tokens remain delisted, and Binance is not known for re-listing tokens they already removed. Two of the prices seem to have gotten over the delisting news already: CloakCoin’s price remains almost the same (UTC 09:40 AM) as it was 24 hours ago with a drop of -0.06%, and Salt dropped by only 0.62%. Modum even increased by 7.9%, Wings jumped by 7.24%, while Substratum is the only suffering an actual loss, having dropped by 6.96%. As Binance has delisted four altcoins last October, their prices fell without recovering to previous levels. Moreover, subsequent market crash in November, pushed prices even lower. The price of Bytecoin (BCN) has fallen an additional 60% in the meantime (from USD 0.001639 to USD 0.000651 as of the time of writing), ChatCoin (CHAT) has fallen around 82% (from USD 0.01586 to USD 0.002840), which is almost the same as Iconomi (ICN) (from USD 0.3595 to USD 0.061999), and Triggers (TRIG) was the only one to suffer a relatively small net fall of 23% (from USD 0.1514 to USD 0.116729).

" In the past few sessions, there was a sharp rise in ethereum price after it broke the USD 125 and USD 130 resistance levels. The daily trading volume picked up momentum, resulting in a bullish break in bitcoin price above the USD 3,650 and USD 3,700 resistance levels. BTC/USD traded close to the USD 3,780 and later corrected below USD 3,750. Similarly, altcoins such as BNB, EOS, LTC, BCH and others gained bullish momentum and moved into a positive zone. The current price action (UTC 08:10 AM) is positive and it seems like bitcoin, ethereum and other altcoins may continue to rise in the near term. Total market capitalization  After forming a solid support base above the USD 3,560 level, bitcoin price  started a decent upward move. BTC/USD broke a couple of key resistances near USD 3,600 to move into a bullish zone. Buyers pushed the price above the USD 3,700 and USD 3,750 resistance levels. The price traded close to the USD 3,780 level and later corrected lower.
On the downside, an initial support is near the USD 3,700 level. However, the main weekly supports are USD 3,650 and USD 3,600 (the previous resistance levels). On the upside, the first hurdle for buyers is near USD 3,780 - USD3,800, above which the price could test the USD 4,000 weekly resistance. Ethereum price  performed really well and broke the key USD 125 and USD 130 resistance levels. ETH/USD broke the USD 135 resistance as well and traded close to the USD 140 level.
The price is currently up around 10.5% to USD 137, with an immediate support at USD 135. The main support is at USD 130 (the previous weekly pivot zone). On the upside, a break above USD 140 may push the price towards USD 146 and USD 150. Bitcoin cash  gained traction after it broke the USD 125 resistance level. BCH/USD is up more than 6% and it seems like buyers could push the price above the USD 130 level in the near term.
EOS  is back above the USD 2.80 and USD 2.85 resistance levels. If buyers remain in control, the price is likely to surpass the USD 2.95 and USD 3.00 resistance levels in the coming sessions.
Ripple price  stayed above the USD 0.300 support and it recently moved above the USD 0.305 resistance. XRP/USD is currently trading near USD 0.310, with the key resistance at USD 0.312 and USD 0.320. During the past few sessions, a few small cap altcoins surged higher and gained more than 10%, including WAX, ARK, VERI, TOMO, BTG, KMD and KCS. Out of these, WAX rallied more than 40% and ARK is up around 32%. Overall, the crypto market is gathering pace, resulting in solid gains in bitcoin and ethereum. BTC/USD could trade in a range for some time before buyers attempt to push the price above USD 3,780 and USD 3,800. However, the main barrier is near USD 4,000, where sellers are likely to take a stand.

" Until governments really start to accept cryptocurrencies of some way, shape, or form, it’s gonna be very difficult for the major institutional investors to tap into crypto, according to the CEO of futures exchange operator CME Group, Terry Duffy. “We’ll have to do a wait and see,” he added in an interview with Bloomberg TV, when asked about what is holding institutions back from jumping with both feet into crypto. “I was a big believer that we needed to go forward and list bitcoin in some way, shape, or form,” Duffy explained, while emphasizing that this is “a brand-new asset class that is coming to the marketplace, so you need to be able to walk before you run.” In the interview, Duffy also touched on moves made by the major investment bank JPMorgan, which has become controversial in the crypto community after several polarizing statements about bitcoin by CEO Jamie Dimon. However, as pointed out by Duffy, even this bank is now turning positive towards crypto, and is even working on its very own “JPMorgan coin.” “They were very […] pessimistic on the whole bitcoin idea a couple of years ago, and now they’re coming up with some offerings. Goldman Sachs is on the same way,” Duffy said, stressing that the key to the success of any currency, whether it’s fiat or crypto, is going to be associated with the government.  “So I think the government needs to be more involved,” he concluded. Meanwhile cryptocurrency adoption just got another boost from institutional investors this week, as police officers and other state employees in Virginia’s Fairfax County will be looking forward to retirement with potential dividends from Bitcoin thanks to a new USD 40 million crypto venture fund by digital asset management firm Morgan Creek Digital.  As reported by Cryptonews.com, this year, governments will likely focus on two areas: taxation and regulation surrounding offerings/marketing to the public. Having seen that cryptocurrencies are becoming more safely policed, the general public may become more willing to use and adopt them. Meanwhile, in Q3 of 2018, interest in bitcoin futures trading was growing steadily since the two leading futures exchanges in the US, CME Group and CBOE, launched their respective markets in December 2017.

" If you’d like to do something nice for Valentine’s Day for your partner, yourself, or even crypto as an industry, but roses and chocolates don’t seem to quite cut it, worry not: there are many solutions to this problem. Either write a lovey-dovey message into the Bitcoin blockchain for all future generations to see, or order a pizza with Lightning Network (because who wants to go out for a fancy dinner anyway?) If you’re considering writing your loved one (or yourself, we’re not judging here) a card that reveals your deepest feelings and also incidentally fits into 80 or less characters, why not make it eternal? That is now made possible through Lovechain.land, a new online service that lets you write a free message of up to 80 characters that is then included in a Bitcoin transaction, promoted all over the network and written into the blockchain forever. The service is free in that the project is covering the transaction cost for the first 1,000 messages. After that, users are encouraged to donate Bitcoin or Ether to keep the service running. As of the time of writing, 87 messages have been written. A few of them below:  Those who choose to cement their love in the blockchain also get a PDF certificate that shows the text they wrote, as well as the time, date and ID of the message. As Reddit user u/satoshiiiiiiiiii puts it, “Like an internet tattoo that your future spouse will see later on.” Or, well, your current spouse. Or whoever you want to devote it to. And of course, you’d be missing out if you didn’t share it with your partner the way the team behind the project proposes: “My love, I have engraved a message for you into Bitcoin blockchain that is distributed over 10,000 nodes all around the world as a symbol of commitment, strength and permanency of our relationship, what’s more, one day it might even be examined by a digital archaeologist. So we are part of history. Here’s the proof,” and then you give them the certificate and you ride off into the sunset. Sweet, right? Or, if you or your partner or your pet (again, no judging) are the type to enjoy a nice meal, and you incidentally live in the US and have nothing against Domino’s pizzas, why not order one or ten and pay for it through Lightning Network? A project called Lightning Pizza, going under the ln.pizza handle, now lets you buy a Domino’s pizza for 5% off from anywhere in the US (let's hope other countries will appear on their map soon,) with less than USD 0.01 in fees. The project was launched only yesterday, February 13th, so maybe you can get them to cut the pepperoni into heart shapes for today.  Moreover, it seems that Lightning Network might strike other pizzas, also: we're pizza agnostic, and want to get everyone their favorite pie soon!

" Founded by Wall Street and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, crypto brokerage startup Voyager Digital, that serves as a tool to help users find the best prices for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has just launched a mobile app for “commission-free trading of 18 of the largest and most liquid crypto assets.”  The app is currently available on iOS mobile operating systems, and the company has not yet announced an Android version. “Voyager will institute a measured roll-out beginning with clients in Arizona, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana and Wisconsin, states in which residents are already approved to trade digital assets,” the press release reads. “As Voyager’s applications with more key states are approved, those wait listed users will be invited and on-boarded respectively, with a goal of ultimately having more than 40 approved states by the end of 2019.” According to the company, they have partnered with ""over a dozen"" of crypto exchanges and liquidity providers, while Voyager's ""dynamic smart order router"" identifies inefficiencies in the larger crypto market and takes advantage of pricing disparities to save their customers money. ""We take a fraction of the savings (frequently referred to as a “spread”) and pass the rest on to our customers. This allows Voyager to operate commission-free and keeps us motivated to save customers money on orders,"" the startup explained without specifying how large the ""fraction of the savings"" is.  The app is also introducing cost basis and tax analysis services. According to the announcement, the app features: “Our vision to bring the crypto brokerage experience in line with what investors have come to expect from equity markets is now a reality,” said Stephen Ehrlich, Voyager co-founder and CEO, adding that “we knew there was a better way for investors to access a cost-efficient and transparent platform."" The company has previously gone public in Canada, starting trading on the Toronto Venture Exchange (TSX-V) under the ticker VYGR, as a result of a reverse merger reportedly valued at USD 60 million. Ehrlich said that the decision to go public is set to bring a higher level of trust from customers, adding, “By becoming a publicly traded entity, Voyager allows the traditional investing community to tap the public markets for exposure to this important asset class and financial utility that is built upon the technology of the future [...] This type of exposure will help more people become comfortable with the crypto market and ultimately increase widespread adoption.” VYGR price chart:",2019-02-14
" It seems that bitcoin traders are getting tired of the same old story of proposals for bitcoin-related exchange traded funds (ETFs) getting introduced, and then either rejected or withdrawn.  Just this week it happened again, as a recently announced ETF proposal was withdrawn from consideration by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, the market barely even took notice. Moreover, bitcoin went up slightly after the news was announced, but it’s still down 0.65% over the past 24 hours Thursday morning (UTC 06:53 AM.) Meanwhile, on Monday, after the ETF news broke, the market remained almost unmoved before dropping on Tuesday morning. As reported, a US-based company by the name Reality Shares ETF Trust filed a proposal with the SEC to list its “Reality Shares Blockforce Global Currency Strategy ETF” on NYSE Arca, a US-based exchange for the listing and trading of ETFs. The ETF would reportedly differ from the other ETF proposals out there by investing not only in bitcoin futures contracts, but also in other types of more conservative and traditional investments like bonds and money market funds. According to the issuer, this would lower the risk of the fund, and thus improve the chances of getting an approval from the SEC. The problem, however, is that the company behind the proposal on Tuesday had already withdrawn their application from consideration. According to a note sent to the SEC on Tuesday February 12, the company withdrew the proposal “at the request of the Staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.” It was withdrawn because the SEC is still taking the position that it’s not appropriate to file a registered 40 Act fund with cryptocurrency exposure at this time, a lawyer representing Reality Shares told Coindesk. The problem with the proposal specifically centers around the use of the “40 Act,” because this would have meant that the proposal would be automatically approved within 75 days, according to current SEC rules. This is what the SEC staffers took issue with, and which led the company to withdraw the proposal, the unnamed lawyer said. “This confirms my view that regulators aren't comfortable with a Bitcoin ETF yet, and that we shouldn't expect one in 2019. This year is about institutional adoption, raising custody standards, building infrastructure, and in the process paving the way for retail mass adoption,“ popular economist and Bitcoin investor Tuur Demeester tweeted. ___ Other reactions: Yes. Certainly better to have one that's backed one for one with real BTC. @gaborgurbacs all 👀 on you! ____ Meanwhile, Securities and Exchange Commissioner Hester Peirce downplayed expectations for a commission vote on a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund or product in 2019, Washington Examiner reported. ""[W]e have applications. … those are subject to a very specific time frame where we have to act within a certain amount of time, and so that’s what it’s going to depend on. And those are very arcane rules as to whether it happens or not, so I can’t speculate on the timing,"" she was quoted as saying. However, at the same time, there are other ETFs that help to get exposure to the crypto industry, such as the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF. According to Bloomberg, it tracks companies that are developing, using, partnering with, or investing in blockchain and cryptocurrency technology. ",2019-02-14
" More than four years after the infamous Mt. Gox incident, where approximately 850,000 bitcoins belonging to customers and the cryptocurrency exchange were announced to be missing and likely stolen, victims have been filing rehabilitation claims and are now waiting to be reimbursed. However, it seems that they might need to wait even longer, as two different entities are slowing down the process: cryptocurrency company CoinLab, headed by CEO Peter Vessenes, and former child actor and crypto entrepreneur Brock Pierce. The now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange has been awarded permission to begin the process for civil rehabilitation in June last year, by the Tokyo District Court. Among the claimants is also CoinLab with a claim for a whopping USD 15 billion (JPY 1.6 trillion), according to a photo of the claim shared by lawyer Daniel Kelman. Kelman is one of the many who lost their bitcoins in the Mt. Gox crash. He has been actively involved in the Gox case since 2013. He does not formally represent anyone and maintains that he is a creditor, with the best interests for creditors as motivation for his actions. CoinLab does not have a case, Kelman believes: “My bet is that CoinLab is holding out for an initial court ruling. The trustee will motion to have the CoinLab's claim/suit dismissed in court in a summary judgement motion. These motions are seldom granted and are only appropriate in cases where the result is obvious and the court's time not wasted hearing the facts.”  The lawyer added that Coinlab may have just enough to get past this summary judgement motion.  “It will be in this moment where CoinLab may try to bargain for a settlement. The trustee should hold firm and offer CoinLab nothing since they do not have a claim they can prevail on once the facts are heard,” Kelman told Cryptonews.com. Meanwhile, Shinnosuke Fukuoka, partner at Japanese law firm Nishimura & Asahi, which has previously represented Mt. Gox creditors, said that “it is very advantageous for them to claim a large amount of money, although they don’t have any ground.” “If the amount claimed was very small, the trustee could ignore it until they distribute the funds to other creditors. However, now the trustee has to keep all of the funds until this dispute is settled, which is very disadvantageous to other creditors, as they can’t get anything until this is done. CoinLab hopes the large claim will mean more settlement money when they get to that point,” Fukuoka added. Kelman believes that Peter Vessenes feels he missed his chance to be at the helm of the US's first bitcoin exchange.  “He blew his chance in late 2010 by turning down an offer from Jed McCaleb (co-founder of Stellar) to take over Mt. Gox. Seven months or so later he came back trying but failing to assert an ownership stake in Mt. Gox after Bitcoin has soared from USD 1 to USD 30,” Kelman said. According to him, Vessenes missed yet another chance by not fulfilling the terms of the agreement he entered into with Mt. Gox which would have given him 90% of Mt. Gox's US business. 
“The damages he now claims are based off a Coinbase valuation. I think he simply cannot let go, even to the point where it has destroyed his public name. He's like a Lord of the Rings character who can't give up chasing the ring even when its pursuit has turned him into a villain and is destroying him from the inside,” the lawyer added. “The damages he now claims are based off a Coinbase valuation. I think he simply cannot let go, even to the point where it has destroyed his public name. He's like a Lord of the Rings character who can't give up chasing the ring even when its pursuit has turned him into a villain and is destroying him from the inside,” the lawyer added. Vessenes did not respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, a new initiative dubbed Gox Rising is calling for a new, accelerated rehabilitation plan for creditors of Mt. Gox, with the long-term goal of rebooting the trading platform, and is led by crypto entrepreneur Brock Pierce. He says that their long-term aim is to reboot the platform as a “Gox or Mt. Gox” exchange - to rehabilitate not only lost funds, but the brand name and domain itself. The rebooted platform would reportedly be non-custodial, to minimize security liabilities. As for restarting a new exchange, it is questionable whether Pierce would even be able to obtain a license from the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA), which has become significantly more rigorous in approving cryptocurrency exchanges following the infamous Coincheck hack from early last year. It took Coincheck more than 12 months to relaunch and restore its operations after finding an investor that was capable of paying back users that were affected by the security breach. The Coincheck case also did not have pending lawsuits or complaints in the magnitude of Mt. Gox that slowed down the process of the restoration of the company. It is estimated that the chances of Pierce relaunching Mt. Gox with its added complexities are very slim. Kelman agrees: “Similar to CoinLab's Peter Vessenes, Pierce harbors feeling of a missed opportunity of which he cannot let go. He tried and failed to acquire Mt. Gox in 2014, getting only so far as a letter-of-intent (LOI) which is clearly not an enforceable agreement but which Pierce apparently wants to litigate over nonetheless.” The lawyer added that like Vessenes, Pierce runs the risk of allowing an unrelenting pursuit of the Mt. Gox ‘ring’ to get the better of him and turn him “into a LOTR-esque [LOTR - The Lord of The Rings] villain should he litigate the unenforceable LOI to the detriment of creditors [...]” “He doesn't need to control civil rehabilitation if he wants to do something nice for Mt. Gox victims, but thus far he seems uninterested in this idea. I do not think Pierce's LOI poses any serious risks,” Kelman concluded. And with the so-called “LOTR-esque villains” fighting over Mt. Gox and the funds, the small creditors, arguably the hobbits of the story, are pushed somewhat into the background until it all blows over. But when?  “The timeline will depends on how the litigation with CoinLab goes,” Fukuoka commented. “Even if the trustee and the court worked very hard without CoinLab representing an issue, it would take more than a year. However, other examples from CoinLab’s legal issues show that they fight very hard, so the creditors receiving their funds seems to be the far future.” The next creditors’ meeting will be held at Tokyo District Courtroom on March 20th, 2019. The deadline for the submission of the proposed rehabilitation plan has been moved from February 14th to April 26th, 2019.
___________________ In November 2012, Seattle-based cryptocurrency company CoinLab struck a deal with Mt. Gox, which would let CoinLab become Mt. Gox’s exclusive agent for sales in North America. This would give them access to all of Mt. Gox’s customers and databases, exclusive permission to do business in the place of Mt. Gox in the US and Canada, as well as having CoinLab receive 90% of the revenue for all new customers. Mt. Gox agreed to such terms because obtaining a license to run a Bitcoin exchange in the North American area was extremely complex at the time - they would have needed both a federal license for the US, as well as a separate license for each state. CoinLab claimed to have all licenses they needed to start operating. Except - they didn’t, and that’s where the trouble began. Mt. Gox was supposed to hand over access to their customers and databases, as stated above, but they were slow to do so, which led CoinLab to sue them for breach of contract in May 2013. The lawsuit contended that Mt. Gox failed to allow CoinLab to move existing US and Canadian customers from Mt. Gox to CoinLab. MtGox answered and counterclaimed, stating that (a) CoinLab was never licensed and the agreement was void because it required CoinLabs to essentially break the law, and (b) CoinLab stole USD 5.3 million in Mt. Gox customer deposits and converted them to company use. When Mt. Gox went down, CoinLab CEO Peter Vessenes filed a claim for USD 75 million, representing the value of their suit against Mt. Gox. They have also refused to return the USD 5.3 million of creditor money, claiming they had the right to offset it against the lawsuit. The Brock Pierce led group is working on a plan for recovery, and aims to present the Civil Rehabilitation plan to the Mt Gox Trustee by the 22nd of April, 2019. Pierce claims that he has bought the 12% stake that Jed McCaleb owned in the Mt. Gox exchange for 1 BTC. This fact is yet to be confirmed by McCaleb. Pierce additionally claims that he has bought the 88% of the shares owned by former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles. However, the issue is that back in 2014 Brock Pierce’s company Sunlot approached and negotiated with Karpeles’s Tibanne to acquire and attempt to rehabilitate Mt. Gox, so the two parties signed a letter of intent - not a binding sale agreement in itself. Additionally, Mt. Gox was already under civil rehabilitation at the time, which means it could not have entered any binding agreements, let alone sales, without the permission of the court. Further, in his intentions, Brock Pierce promises to: However, the claims will already be fairly re-evaluated during the civil rehabilitation process, so the first point is moot. There is absolutely no indication that any of the missing bitcoins can be found, let alone recovered, and Nobuaki Kobayashi, the exchange’s trustee, is already fighting the CoinLab lawsuit.

" Crypto companies and miners starved for returns on their large holdings of digital assets are increasingly looking to derivatives linked to crypto tokens as a source of income. Tech companies in the crypto space run mainly by software developers are negotiating terms of derivatives contracts directly with Wall Street’s most seasoned financial professionals, with options contracts linked to crypto tokens being particularly popular, Bloomberg reported.  The activity is reportedly part of a broader trend where these tech companies do whatever they need to do to raise enough cash to survive the crypto winter, experts claim.  According to the report, option trades began appearing about six months ago and estimated sales volume ranges from USD 125 million per month to USD 500 million. Also, views differ on whether the main users are professional counterparties trading between themselves, or the miners who create the digital assets and other large token holders. The report provided an example of a trade. In January, QCP Capital from an ICO project bought a three-month call option for a notional amount equivalent to 250 Bitcoins. If at expiry Bitcoin is below the USD 4,200 level, the ICO project would collect a premium of USD 66,250 and keep its Bitcoins. If, in April, Bitcoin exceeds USD 4,200, the counterparty will be required to sell its 250 Bitcoins at that price.  However, others warn that miners and other holders desperate to generate income are turning themselves into easy victims for the finance professionals: “The trading professionals will try to take the miners for a ride by getting them to sell options too cheaply,” former Citigroup derivatives trader-turned crypto miner Sath Ganesarajah said. According to data from JP Morgan Chase & Co., the average cost to mine one bitcoin was USD 4,060 in the fourth quarter of 2018. Today, the average price per bitcoin on crypto exchanges is around USD 3,650, which has already forced many miners to shut down. Although swimming with sharks may be dangerous, some of the large holders and miners of digital assets may in other words have no choice but to take the chance.

" Bitcoin price consolidated above the key USD 3,600 support level. Later, BTC/USD started a slow and steady rise above the USD 3,630 level. It seems like buyers are currently (UTC 08:10 AM) in action and they could succeed in pushing the price above the USD 3,650 and USD 3,660 resistance levels. Conversely, there were bullish moves in ethereum and ripple. ETH/USD climbed above the USD 125 level and it seems like it could test the USD 130 level. XRP/USD stayed above the USD 0.300 support and traded higher towards the USD 0.310 resistance. Total market capitalization  There is a strong support base formed near USD 3,600 in bitcoin price . BTC/USD is slowly moving higher and it could break the USD 3,650 resistance level. Once buyers gain momentum above USD 3,650, the price is likely to accelerate higher towards the USD 3,700 and USD 3,750 resistance levels. 
If there is no upside break above the USD 3,650 level, there is a risk of a short term downside reaction. A break below the USD 3,600 support may perhaps spark bearish moves towards the USD 3,570 and USD 3,550 support levels. Ethereum price  is gaining momentum and buyers seem to be in control above the USD 124. ETH/USD spiked above USD 125 and it could make another attempt to surpass the USD 128 and USD 130 resistance levels.
On the other hand, if there is a downside correction, an initial support is near the USD 122 level, below which the price might test the key USD 120 support. Bitcoin cash price  is up more than 2% and it is currently trading above USD 124. If BCH/USD climbs above the USD 125 resistance, there are chances of an upside break towards the USD 130 and USD 132 resistance levels. On the downside, supports are aligned near USD 122 and USD 120.
EOS  is gaining strength above USD 2.90 and it is currently up more than 6%. An immediate resistance is at USD 3.00, above which there are chances of a run towards the USD 3.15 level.
Ripple price  formed a decent support base near the USD 0.300 level. XRP/USD started an upside correction and traded above the USD 0.304 and USD 0.305 resistance levels. The price is currently trading near USD 0.308 and it could test the USD 0.312 resistance in the near term. In the past few hours, a few altcoins traded higher and posted gains between 7%-20%, including MOAC, ARK, NANO, XIN, QNT, ZEC, MKR and KMD. Out of these, MOAC rallied around 20% and ARK is up around 11%. The current price action is positive and it seems like bitcoin price might clear the USD 3,650 hurdle sooner or later. Once there is a proper break above USD 3,650, BTC/USD could gain strength, which will most likely spark more upsides in ethereum, ripple, eos, litecoin, bitcoin cash and other altcoins in the near term.

" There has been a bizarre twist in the ongoing Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX case – with the company “inadvertently” transferring 103 bitcoins (around USD 369,000) from hot wallets into inaccessible cold wallets just hours after a court-appointed monitor had located it. The Vancouver Sun states that Ernst & Young – the financial firm tasked with monitoring QuadrigaCX after the exchange was placed into administration last week – made the startling revelation in a report issued on February 12. Per the report, Ernst & Young successfully located over USD 680,000 worth of Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum in hot wallets on February 5, but “something went wrong” the very next day – with QuadrigaCX “inadvertently” moving 103 BTC into cold wallets that the monitor cannot access. The report continues, “The monitor is working with [QuadrigaCX] management to retrieve this cryptocurrency from the various cold wallets, if possible. The monitor has made arrangements to transfer the remaining cryptocurrency into a cold wallet that will be retained by the monitor.” And according to the report, deceased CEO Gerald Cotten’s encrypted laptop may not be the only electronic device that could contain vital clues to the case. The Canadian court that has placed QuadrigaCX into administration has been handed “two active laptops, two older model laptops, two active cellphones, two dead cellphones and three encrypted USB flash drives,” and will also seek to seize a desktop device from Cotten’s home office. Many had expected that the keys to the cold wallets would be found on the encrypted laptop already in the court’s possession. According to Cotten’s widow, only the CEO had access to the laptop in question. The exchange has been attempting to address major problems with liquidity after the reported death of the CEO, who appears to have died with the access codes to 115,000 wallets that supposedly hold some USD 190 million, rendering the wallets inaccessible. The exchange, which is Canada’s largest, also appears to have major debt issues, with allegations of foul play also footed at the company. As previously reported on Cryptonews.com, one Reddit has user claimed that several wallets had initiated transactions soon after the QuadrigCX case had hit the news. Researchers at Zerononcense have also claimed they have traced cryptocurrency transfers from at least 31 customer wallets to company-owned accounts. As many experts have stressed, crypto users should keep their private keys to their coins offline, e.g. in hardware wallets such as Ledger, Trezor, KeepKey and others.",2019-02-13
" Anyone who is following the Bitcoin ETF story already knows that the abbreviation stands for exchange-traded fund and that it’s is widely believed to be a huge catalyst for the price of bitcoin. However, a new proposal has surfaced that would mix Bitcoin with more conservative investments in order to minimize the investment risk that is setting the new asset back - and the community is amazed that nobody thought of this before. Reality Shares ETF Trust, a subsidiary of US-based asset manager Blockforce Capital, filed a registration form with the Securities and Exchange Commission to list its “Reality Shares Blockforce Global Currency Strategy ETF” on NYSE Arca, a US-based exchange for the listing and trading of ETFs.  If approved, the fund would invest in a portfolio which includes “high-quality, short-term sovereign debt instruments listed for trading on US exchanges and denominated in US dollar, euro, British pounds sterling, Japanese yen and Swiss francs,” as well as bitcoin futures, money market mutual funds and/or other cash equivalents, according to the filing. The fund would invest in cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts. This means that once the contract expires, the investor receives the cash equivalent of the amount of bitcoins held instead of actual bitcoins. According to the filing, “the fund will not invest directly in bitcoin.”  “The Fund expects to obtain exposure to Bitcoin Futures by investing up to 25% of its total assets, as measured at the end of every quarter of the Fund’s taxable year, in a wholly-owned and controlled Cayman Islands subsidiary,” reads the registration form. “However, the Adviser will seek to limit the Subsidiary’s investment in Bitcoin Futures, so the Fund’s aggregate notional exposure to Bitcoin Futures is limited to 15% of the Fund’s net assets at the time of investment.” Aside from the 15% devoted to Bitcoin, the portfolio will be made up of 15% of the Fund’s net assets in fixed income securities denominated in each fiat significant global currency, as well as 10% of the Fund’s net assets in money market instruments for margin and/or cash management purposes. Mati Greenspan, senior analyst at cryptocurrency exchange eToro, wrote on Twitter, “Seriously, how has nobody thought of this before?! By limiting the fund to just 15% BTC and diversifying with other sovereign currencies this ETF, if approved, will protect investors from whatever manipulation the SEC seems to be afraid of.” Erik Voorhees, the founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift, also commented: “The market finds a way…” Meanwhile, last week, Securities and Exchange Commissioner Robert Jackson told the Roll Call that at some point he expects a crypto exchange-traded fund: ""Eventually, do I think someone will satisfy the standards that we've laid out there? I hope so, yes, and I think so.""  Moreover, a Bitcoin ETF is “virtually certain,” CNBC reports finance expert Ric Edelman as saying. “The only question is when [...] The SEC has several legitimate thoughtful concerns that the industry has to overcome but I'm confident they will. Eventually we will see a bitcoin ETF and it's at that stage that I will be much more comfortable recommending that ordinary investors participate.”",2019-02-12
" Bitcoin price settled above the USD 3,600 support area and later started consolidating gains. BTC/USD seems to be struggling near USD 3,640 and USD 3,650, above which the price is likely to accelerate towards USD 3,700 and USD 3,720. Ethereum price is trading above the USD 120 support, with bullish moves. ETH/USD is facing hurdles near USD 123 and USD 125, above which there is a chance of a sharp upward move in the near term. On the other hand, ripple price is currently struggling, but it is still trading above the USD 0.300 support area.  Total market capitalization  There seems to be a strong support formed in bitcoin price  above the USD 3,585 and USD 3,600 support levels. If BTC/USD breaks the USD 3,585 support, there could be an extended downside correction towards the USD 3,500 support area. 
On the other hand, a successful close above the USD 3,640 and USD 3,650 resistance levels could open the doors for a decent upward move towards the USD 3,700 and 3,720 resistance levels. The next key hurdle is near the USD 3,780 - USD 3,800 resistance area. Ethereum price  corrected lower recently, but the USD 120 support acted as a solid support. ETH/USD is slowly moving higher towards the USD 123 and USD 125 resistance levels. 
A proper break above the USD 125 resistance might encourage buyers to gain traction above the USD 130 pivot level in the near term. An initial support is near USD 120, followed by the USD 118 level. Bitcoin cash price  failed to stay above the USD 124 support and corrected lower below the USD 122 level. BCH/USD is currently approaching the USD 120 support, which is likely to act as a strong hurdle for sellers. On the upside, the USD 124 and USD 125 levels are important resistances.
EOS  is trading in a bullish zone above the USD 2.65 and USD 2.70 support levels. On the upside, a break above the USD 2.80 - USD 2.82 resistance could set the pace for a drift towards the USD 3.00 resistance.
Ripple price  remained in a bearish zone as it traded below the USD 0.310 and USD 0.306 support levels. XRP/USD tested the USD 0.300 support and it is currently consolidating losses. The next major support is at USD 0.296 and USD 0.295. A few altcoins gained traction recently and moved up between 6%-20%, including MOAC, HT, BTT, ETP, MKR, NPXS and KMD. Out of these, BTT surged by more than 20% and MOAC is up around 16%. Overall, the crypto market is trading nicely in the bullish zone and bitcoin price could accelerate above the USD 3,650 resistance. However, if BTC/USD fails to stay above the USD 3,585 support, there could be an extended decline in bitcoin and altcoins in the near term.

" Social media giant Twitter may be about to take a big step into crypto with a much-anticipated feature that would allow tip its users for their tweets.  While speaking on the Stephan Livera podcast on Monday, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said that bitcoin tipping using the Lightning Network on Twitter is a “really compelling” idea. “I think there’s a lot there […] It’s really compelling, and it’s something that we want to spend a lot more time on,” Dorsey said, adding that there is “a pretty active conversation within the company” and that they want to be “smart about it.” According to Dorsey, bitcoin tipping via the Lightning network would provide more economic incentive to Twitter users, not only its audience reach. The CEO is among investors in Lighting Labs, the developer of the Lightning Network, which allows much faster and cheaper off-chain bitcoin transactions.  At the end of 2018, Twitter had 321 million monthly active users, or 3% less than a year ago, according to the company's latest earnings release Twitter’s CEO has also previously said that he “love the idea” of letting users tip each other with bitcoin, and in an interview on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast earlier this month he also elaborated on what he thinks makes bitcoin different from all the other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, previously he even said that he believes bitcoin will become the world’s single currency.  Also, while speaking together with CEO of Lightning Labs Elizabeth Stark during the podcast on Monday, Dorsey revealed that there are plans to integrate the Lighting Network with Square’s Cash App, a popular mobile payment app. “It’s not an ‘if,’ it’s more of a ‘when,’ and how do we make sure that we’re getting the speed that we need and the efficiency,” according to Dorsey, who’s also founder and CEO of Square.  Despite the optimistic tone from Twitter’s CEO himself about the prospects for a bitcoin tipping feature, the community has already started to work on their own solutions for a tipping tool, with the tippin.me app being one example. 🤔 What if you had a Chrome extension that inserts a https://t.co/ZnASkDvUDU button in every Tweet?#LightningNetwork #LightningTorch pic.twitter.com/nU0h1AUm8m However, some users on Reddit have doubts about this tool since it holds bitcoin as a custodian for users, without giving users direct access to the private keys. Other users argue that custodial solutions are still acceptable for smaller amounts. “One reason I'm in favor is because custodial solutions are, for some people, a gateway into non-custodial solutions. Once you've worked with tippin.me or Bitlum, you might look more into bitcoin, discover the ""not your keys, not your coins"" principle, and then start using a noncustodial wallet,” a reddit user nowitsallgone wrote.",2019-02-12
" After the crypto market exploded last Friday, Tom Lee, the famous Bitcoin bull and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, shared some optimistic insights about the bitcoin price.  First, on Sunday, Lee referred to a technical analysis by a TradingView, a social network for traders, user MagicPoopCannon, as an example of an analyst who has previously been bearish on bitcoin, but is now turning bullish, arguing that moving average lines are now setting up to form solid support for the price of bitcoin. CRYPTO: Some TA's who were bearish in 2019 are becoming incrementally bullish on #BTC $BTCThe one below refers to the 200-week mavg acting as support, something @rsluymer @fundstrat TA also noted as key support for Bitcoin.https://t.co/QOBqcQ83FV However, opinions are mixed on how much emphasis should be placed on the analysis Lee shared: Head of an investment fund tweet analysis from a cartoon called magic poop cannon. Only in crypto... lol Also, not everyone on TradingView agrees with the analysis.  “Remember, on higher time frames trend is your friend and calling this the “bottom” is absolutely unprofessional as there is no way to know that for at least a couple months of retesting. Wanting to garner likes by stating that this is it just makes newer traders lose money and I am not into that. Risk mitigation is still a priority as long as the price is under USD 4400 at the very least,” trader Reparation responded. Also, last week, Fundstrat Global Advisors strategist Robert Sluymer said that cryptocurrencies are on track to retest their fourth-quarter lows in a weak technical position. A proprietary gauge of market breadth in the space shows smaller coins are most at risk, he added. According to Sluymer, a break below USD 3,100 would imply a decline to USD 2,270, while a move above USD 4,200 is needed to signal Bitcoin is beginning to improve.  Prior to the discussion about MagicPoopCannon’s analysis, Fundstrat published its 2019 Outlook report for the cryptocurrency market. According to excerpts of the report, the firm admits that 2018 was a disappointing year for crypto, while also adding that they expect the market to stage “a visible recovery” in 2019.  According to the firm, there are now “9 incremental improvements in the landscape” that may support higher crypto prices going forward, as seen in the table below: Although some of these developments can certainly be observed by anyone, others are vaguer or are pure speculation. Among the more speculative claims are for example the claim that the bitcoin price will cross its 200-day moving average line by year-end 2019, and that we will see a weakening of the US dollar this year that will benefit the BTC/USD exchange rate.  Tom Lee comments on the 2019 Outlook: This is not the first time Tom Lee has come out with lofty price predictions for the number one cryptocurrency, which in many ways has haunted him throughout the 2018 bear market. Despite that, Lee reaffirmed his view that USD 25,000 is a “fair value for bitcoin” in a recent interview with Fox Business. “Strangely, I just think that’s a good, fair value for Bitcoin, but the timing of that is going to be difficult [...],” he said at the time. Meanhwile, Brian Stutland, the Chief Technology Officer at Equity Armor Investments, told CNBC on Friday (watch the whole segment below) that the recent rally could be a beginning of a bigger rally. ""Because when you look at the fact that if we move Bitcoin into an ETF, now portfolio managers that are out there can actually allocate to Bitcoin in their models and put that some sort of weighting in their holdings in terms of what people want to hold in terms of investment value,"" he explained. Bitcoin futures spike, here's what traders think it means from CNBC. Also, Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at social trading platform eToro, tweeted: Yes, the crypto moves of the last few days have been encouraging. No, we're not out of the bear market just yet. pic.twitter.com/rgQsx2NVff",2019-02-11
" After almost two weeks of trading sideways, the crypto market suddenly exploded on Friday. At the time or writing (UTC 05:08 PM,) all top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are in green.  Bitcoin jumped by more than 8% in the past 24 hours and is trading close to USD 3,700, while Litecoin (LTC) registered strongest gains among top 10 coins (+28%). LTC was the first among top 10 coins that suddenly jumped this Friday. In a few hours, total market capitalization increased by USD 10 billion, to USD 122 billion. Top 10 coins by market capitalization: As everyone tries to guess the reason for the explosion, according to The Independent, the latest rise follows news that bitcoin's hashrate – the amount of computing power its network consumes – is at its highest level since November 2018.  Speaking to The Independent before the latest price surge, David Thomas, director of the UK-based cryptocurrency broker GlobalBlock, lamented the negativity in the market but hinted a spark could set it off in a positive direction once again. ""Something needs be the catalyst to get things going again. Unfortunately, global uncertainty for a multitude of reasons is driving many to become more risk averse and so whatever that spark is, it needs to be significant,"" Thomas was quoted as saying. Meanwhile, Securities and Exchange Commissioner Robert Jackson told the Roll Call that at some point he expects a crypto exchange-traded fund, which is widely believed to be a huge catalyst for the price of bitcoin: ""Eventually, do I think someone will satisfy the standards that we've laid out there?

" Bitcoin price mostly traded in a tight range in the past few hours below the USD 3,450 resistance. The current (UTC 08:10 AM) price action is slightly bearish and it seems like BTC/USD is struggling to stay above the USD 3,400 support area. Therefore, there is a risk of a fresh drop below the recent weekly low at USD 3,375. Similarly, major altcoins like ethereum, ripple, EOS, BCH and LTC are trading below key resistance levels, with chances of a downside extension in the coming sessions. Total market capitalization  There was no upside break above the USD 3,450 resistance in bitcoin price . BTC/USD traded lower steadily and it is currently trading just above the USD 3,400 support, with a bearish angle. There is a risk of a downside break below the USD 3,400 support and the USD 3,375 swing low in the near term.
If sellers remain in action, there are chances of further losses below the USD 3,375 and USD 3,350 support levels. On the upside, there is a strong resistance formed near the USD 3,440 and USD 3,450 levels. Ethereum price  traded higher a few points, but it faced a strong resistance near the USD 106 level. ETH/USD is currently consolidating and it seems like it could resume its decline towards USD 102 or USD 100.
To start a decent upside correction, buyers must clear the USD 105 and USD 106 resistance levels. However, a substantial recovery won’t be easy since there are many resistances between USD 108 - USD 112. Bitcoin cash price  traded above the USD 115 level, but it is finding a strong selling interest near the USD 116 - USD 117 area. The next major resistance is at USD 120, above which the price could move into a positive zone.
EOS  managed to move above the USD 2.35 level, with a positive angle. However, buyers must gain upward momentum above the USD 2.40 resistance. If not, the price may drop back towards the USD 2.30 support.
Ripple price  traded in a tight range above the USD 0.290 support. XRP/USD is facing a strong resistance zone near the USD 0.292 - USD 0.294 resistance area. A failure to climb above USD 0.294 might result in a downside extension below the USD 0.290 support. Despite range moves in bitcoin and ethereum, a few small cap altcoins gained bullish momentum, including QNT, VERI, POLY, WAX, POWR, GNT and ELF. Out of these, QNT surged higher by more than 40% and VERI is up around 10%. To sum up, bitcoin price must stay above the USD 3,400 and USD 3,375 support levels. If not, BTC/USD could decline towards the USD 3,300 or USD 3,260 levels. Similarly, if ethereum and ripple continues to struggle below key resistances, both might start a fresh decline below the recent weekly lows.

" The Coinbase Wallet, offered by cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, has announced that they have added support for Bitcoin (BTC). The community is left scratching their heads and wondering if we have somehow transported back into 2009 for this to be big news. However, the announcement marks an important milestone for the product, which is different from Coinbase Consumer that is being used by many as a crypto wallet. The Coinbase Wallet already offers support to Ethereum (ETH) and over ""100,000 different ERC20 tokens and ERC721 collectibles"" built on the Ethereum platform. The new wallet update with Bitcoin support will roll out to all users on iOS and Android over the next week.  In an official blog post, the team behind the wallet writes, “Our goal with Coinbase Wallet is to create the world’s leading user-custodied crypto wallet [...] Adding support for Bitcoin is an important next step in that direction,” later adding, “We’re also working on support for Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and other popular cryptocurrencies.” The community is mostly confused that the major wallet did not support the largest cryptocurrency by market cap in the first place. “What year are you living in Coinbase?” asks Twitter user @LetheanIO in response to the announcement. Others are simply adding gifs from the Back to the Future blockbusters and others as their reaction.  Launching btc on your crypto-wallet.  Much wow.  What is this? 2009? pic.twitter.com/7sNFrajZut However, the company explains that ""the Coinbase Wallet app is Coinbase’s user-controlled cryptocurrency wallet. With Coinbase.com, you can buy crypto and Coinbase stores it (along with your private keys) for you; with Coinbase Wallet, you store your own crypto (safeguarded by a private key that only you know.)"" Until August 2018, the Coinbase Wallet was known as Toshi, that was developed and launched by the Coinbase team in 2017. When the product was launched, it featured reportedly the world’s first mobile dapp (decentralized application) browser. Later, it became the first wallet to launch crypto collectibles.  ""Our goal was to make managing crypto and accessing the decentralized web as easy as downloading an app on your mobile phone. And as part of our effort to be the most trusted brand in the space, we also set out to provide best-in-class secure storage. With Coinbase Wallet, your private keys are secured using your device’s Secure Enclave and biometric authentication technology,"" Coinbase explained last August. The wallet itself has received a makeover back in November 2018. Since then, it offers users the ability to see the value of their portfolio in their native fiat currency, and added a new gallery for users’ collectibles from dapps.  And while confused users are cracking jokes at Coinbase’s expense, the team has also announced that they’re adding support for PayPal withdrawals for all EU customers and customers in European Free Trade Association countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland). The announcement adds, “Before PayPal, SEPA [Single Euro Payments Area] and UK Faster Payments were the only options for European customers to withdraw funds [...] As one of the world’s easiest and most widely-used payment platforms, adding PayPal as a withdrawal option for European customers offers another great option for withdrawing their funds.”  If you’re not part of any of these territories, there’s hope for you yet. “Not in the E.U, a European Free Trade Association country or the U.S.? We’re working on expanding support for PayPal in 2019, so stay tuned,” the team concludes.",2019-02-06
" Jack Dorsey, co-founder and CEO of social media giant Twitter as well as founder and CEO of mobile payments company Square, has become a new crypto superstar this week. Dorsey, who has more than 4 million followers on Twitter, once again confirmed he is a huge fan of Bitcoin and holds “enough” of what he considers could become “the native currency of the internet.” He has also participated in carrying Bitcoin’s “Lightning Torch” game, which includes him receiving money from the one behind him in the queue and sending it on with an addition to the next person in order to promote the Lightning Network.  Well... https://t.co/q3NuAT9jU9 To a question of “Jack, which all coins/tokons [sic] you holding??” by a Twitter user he replied, “I only have bitcoin,” to which Changpeng Zhao, CEO of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance, tweeted a gif which says, “One of us! One of us!” to general delight. As to why he likes the currency so much, he wrote, “Bitcoin is resilient. Bitcoin is principled. Bitcoin is native to internet ideals. And it’s a great brand.” He also wouldn’t be opposed to the possibility of adding a feature that lets users tip others in satoshis for their tweets, writing “Love the idea” in response to the pitch. Dorsey is a man of few words, at least according to his Twitter account. A tweet saying “Buy ETH” received a simple answer from him: “No.” He did, however, give a longer answer to this question on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, where he said that the Cash app by Square - which currently supports Bitcoin - would not be adding support for any other cryptocurrency in the near future. And when he shows his support for Bitcoin, it does not end on mere words. Bitcoin users have been passing around a so-called Lightning Torch, which is a game wherein each participant adds a little bitcoin to a payment, then passes it onto someone on Twitter that they trust, in order to spread awareness of the second-layer Lightning Network technology. With Dorsey’s participation, the payment has now reached roughly 2,860,000 satoshis. At the time of writing, 143 unique participants have left their legacy in the game. According to the official website, the last participant was Dorsey himself, who sent his torch to Elizabeth Stark, the CEO of Lightning Labs, the company behind Lightning Network. However, Dorsey is among investors in Lightning Labs. Phew, @jack takes the Lightning Torch, sends it to me, tweets a bunch about #bitcoin, agrees to do a podcast on the spot with @stephanlivera and me. Pretty sure #LightningTwitter is now officially a thing!⚡️https://t.co/m2XRb5NmvH However, not everyone thinks Dorsey is out to promote Bitcoin out of the goodness of his own heart. “Calm down about Jack and Lightning, My man's just shilling his bags y'all. Somehow when he does it he's a hero but when i do it the SEC comes after me,” writes Twitter user @Mansa_Godson. He’s not the only one to think so: the Joe Rogan Experience interview was heavily downvoted on YouTube due to Rogan’s reluctance to pose any questions about Twitter “censorship” which saw controversial figures such as American radio show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones banned from the platform. Joe Rogan has already announced that Dorsey will return for a second interview, with Rogan vowing to pose the CEO a tougher set of questions relating to censorship on Twitter.  Another big issue that viewers took with the interview is the fact that the Cash app is a sponsor of the Joe Rogan Experience, which could have prompted Rogan to stick to “safe” topics in his interview with Dorsey, as well as let Dorsey talk up the potential of Bitcoin. Still, most of the community is simply happy to have a big figure from the internet world backing Bitcoin and recognizing its potential, as they believe this could pave the way towards mass adoption.",2019-02-06
" There was a minor upside correction in bitcoin price above the USD 3,450 resistance. However, BTC/USD failed to break the USD 3,480 and USD 3,500 resistance levels. Finally, sellers had the upper hand and they succeeded in pushing the price below the USD 3,450 and USD 3,420 level. The market sentiment turned bearish and it seems like there could be more losses in the near term. Ethereum and ripple also declined heavily and traded below the USD 105 and USD 0.295 support levels respectively to start a fresh decline. Total market capitalization  There was a downside break in bitcoin price  below the USD 3,420 and 3,400 levels. BTC/USD traded close to the USD 3,375 level and later bounced back above USD 3,400. However, the price is trading (UTC 08:20 AM) with a bearish angle and it seems like there could be more losses below USD 3,400 and USD 3,375 in the near term.
The main support is at USD 3,320, below which there is a risk of more downsides towards the USD 3,250 level. On the upside, there are many resistances near the USD 3,440 and USD 3,450 levels. Ethereum price  failed to gain traction and declined below the USD 107 and USD 105 support levels. ETH/USD almost touched the USD 100 support level and it is currently consolidating losses.
If there is a downside break below the USD 101 and USD 100 support levels, there could be heavy declines in the short term. On the upside, resistances are seen near the USD 105 and USD 107 levels. Bitcoin cash price  failed to stay above the USD 116 and USD 115 support levels, opening the doors for a test of the USD 112 support. BCH/USD is currently trading in a range, with supports near the USD 112 and USD 110 levels.
EOS  tumbled below the USD 2.35 support and tested the USD 2.30 level. The price is currently trading with a bearish bias and it could even break the USD 2.30 support level.
Ripple price  performed badly this week as it traded below the USD 0.310 and USD 0.300 support levels. XRP/USD even broke the USD 0.295 support and it is down around 2.2%. The next major support is at USD 0.290, followed by USD 0.288. The past few hours were mostly bearish, but a few small cap altcoins gained traction and traded higher, including BNB, AOA, THETA, ETP and R. Out of these, BNB, the native token of major exchange Binance, rallied close to 15% and AOA is up more than 11%. Moreover, BNB managed to become the 10th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization (USD 1.17 bn.)  Overall, bitcoin price is back in a bearish zone after it failed to clear the USD 3,500 resistance. The current technical structure is negative, suggesting more downsides in BTC/USD below the USD 3,350 level in the coming sessions. Similarly, ethereum might decline below the USD 101 support and ripple price might slide below USD 0.290.

" Although it may seem obvious from the prices, crypto as an industry is not in a good place right now - but prices are only one part of the equation. From the fact that many newcomers seem to care only about speculation, to fund managers failing to raise enough to meet their goals, even crypto exchanges are struggling to keep trading volumes up. But the optimism is hard to beat: for example, Litecoin creator Charlie Lee believes Bitcoin will reach USD 20,000 within the next three years. According to popular cryptocurrency analyst Murad Mahmudov, the number of tweets pertaining to Bitcoin is at about the same level as it was in 2014 and lower than at any point in 2016.  “That is an absolute disaster for the price in the medium-term in my opinion,” he writes in a Twitter thread. “Cryptocurrency's biggest use case is speculation. That is a fact. For better or worse, Speculation and human greed are your biggest hope,” he adds, continuing that the vast majority does not care about the basic tenets of cryptocurrencies like decentralization, self-sovereignty or privacy, but about finding a tool to get rich with. There might still be some hope, Mahmudov believes, but it’s a bleak outlook: “You need a complete price exhaustion and attention exhaustion from anyone except the absolute true believers [...] I would even go as far as arguing that it would be healthy for the prices across the digital currency complex to collapse here. Transfer the coins from the weak hands to the strong hands who don't sell no matter what.” He concludes:  10/ Of course I'll still be here every day till I die.But understand that it will take a hot minute.Strap yourselves in.Patience is virtue. Most funds are struggling to raise money right now - especially now that the ICO (initial coin offering) hype seems to have passed. According to what Anthony “The Pomp” Pompliano, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, a digital asset management firm, wrote in a blog post, “Without institutional investors who can write tens of millions of dollars per check, there is a low artificial cap on the amount of capital that can be raised across the crypto fund landscape.”  There are many reasons for this, but the bear market, the fact that most capital allocators can buy and hold assets themselves, and failure to do due diligence are amongst those, in his opinion. Institutional investors are also scared of risks - especially the risk of ending up in a headline along the words “scam” or “hack” - and there are currently not enough incentives to make up for this. In order to save the market, “We need more seasoned investment professionals who understand the requirements of these capital allocators. We need more time to educate and demystify the technology and opportunities. And most importantly, we need more funds showing multi-year track records filled with attractive profits,” Pompliano believes. But this may not be so far off as all that. An example comes from the United Arab Emirates, where Dubai royal Sheikh Saeed bin Ahmed Al Maktoum has selected Liechtenstein-based cryptocurrency fund manager INVAO as its international blockchain investments partner, according to an emailed press release, which adds: “As Dubai embarks on the Emirates Blockchain Strategy 2021 and builds the nation into a blockchain investment hub, INVAO will provide UAE investors with unprecedented access to crypto as an asset class [...] INVAO allows investors to buy one token which represents a huge portfolio of cryptocurrencies, and engages in crypto portfolio management and arbitrage trading to yield returns. “ Although this is a good sign, it’s far from enough: “In order for this industry to thrive and reach sustainability, we need hundreds of fund managers investing billions of dollars. We will eventually get there, but not before a lot of time, money, and resources are put into building the foundation for the globally dominant investment firms of tomorrow,” Pompliano adds. Cryptocurrency exchanges are struggling as trading volumes are hitting new lows in January not seen since 2017, according to weekly cryptocurrency newsletter Diar. Major cryptocurrency exchange Binance has, for example, seen its Bitcoin/USD market slashed by over 40% versus December 2018, marking the popular token exchange’s worst period since the now-largest exchange came to prominence in 2017. Another exchange, OKEx, had been growing for three months, but January promptly put a stop onto that streak. Coinbase’s BTC/USD pairing is trading with less volume than in May 2017, while Gemini is also seeing one of the worst months in existence. The cryptocurrency hype is hard to beat, even at the worst of times, as many enthusiasts will tell you. A thread on Reddit has revealed that Charlie Lee, creator of cryptocurrency Litecoin, has predicted that Bitcoin should reach USD 20,000 “within the next three years” in Litecoin’s Telegram chat. This is not too far away from Mahmudov's prediction that the next bear run will be in 2023/24. Although cryptocurrency predictions can be a dangerous game, Lee has a history of correct predictions: back in 2017, he infamously sold his entire portfolio of Litecoin sometime during the December 2017 bull run; subsequently, and correctly, foretelling the 2018 crypto crash. Back then, he tweeted, “Ok, sorry to spoil the party, but I need to reign in the excitement a bit… Buying LTC is extremely risky. I expect us to have a multi-year bear market like the one we just had where LTC dropped 90% in value (USD 48 to USD 4). So if you can't handle LTC dropping to USD 20, don't buy!” For comparison, LTC is currently trading at USD 34.4, having fallen from its all-time high of USD 360.66, which is definitely a drop of more than 90%. He also predicted LTC overtaking Bitcoin Cash at the start of the year, an event known as ‘The Flappening.’ This prediction was made 9 months before the event occurred. Although his history with correct predictions may not mean much for the future, it certainly does put many in the crypto community at ease. The ATH will be back, everyone. Charlie Lee said so.",2019-02-05
" Bitcoin price remained below the USD 3,500 resistance, but it also managed to stay above the USD 3,400 support level. BTC/USD moved a few points above the USD 3,450 level and it seems like the price may continue to trade higher. Having said that, an hourly close above the USD 3,500 resistance is must for buyers to gain momentum. On the other hand, ethereum and ripple remain in a bearish zone below USD 110 and USD 0.305 respectively. XRP/USD is gaining bearish momentum below USD 0.300 and it could test USD 0.295 before a fresh rebound in the short term. Total market capitalization  It seems like bitcoin price  is forming a strong support base above the USD 3,420 and USD 3,425 levels. BTC/USD is currently (UTC 08:10 AM) trading above the USD 3,450 level, with a bullish structure. Should buyers push the price above USD 3,480 and USD 3,500, there could be more gains towards the USD 3,550 resistance.
On the other hand, if buyers fail to push the price above USD 3,500, there could be a drop below USD 3,450 and USD 3,440. An immediate support is at USD 3,425, followed by the USD 3,400 level. Ethereum price  is currently consolidating above the USD 105 support, with a few positive signs. However, ETH/USD remains bearish as long as it is trading below the USD 110 and USD 112 resistance levels.
If sellers gain pace below the USD 105 support, the price is likely to slide towards the USD 101 and USD 100 support levels. Bitcoin cash price  moved down further and tested the USD 118 support level. If BCH/USD remains in a bearish zone, there is a risk of a break towards the USD 112 support level in the coming sessions. The main resistances are USD 120 and USD 122.
EOS  slowly moved higher, but it failed to stay above the USD 2.40 resistance. The price is currently consolidating, but it may climb towards the USD 2.42 and USD 2.45 levels in the near term.
Ripple price  declined further and broke the USD 0.302 and USD 0.300 support levels. XRP/USD is down more than 1% and it seems like the price will most likely test the USD 0.295 support level before initiating a recovery attempt. Despite bearish moves in major altcoins, a few small cap altcoins gained traction and gained heavily, including B2G, BTT, NPXS, THETA and ETP. Out of these, B2G rallied close to 280% and BTT is up more than 50%. Overall, bitcoin price is currently stable above USD 3,450, but it must trade above the USD 3,480 and USD 3,500 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. If buyers fail to gain momentum in the coming sessions, there is a risk of a downside break below USD 3,400. Similarly, ethereum and ripple could decline sharply if bitcoin breaks the USD 3,400 - USD 3,420 support.

" This past week, there was a fresh decline initiated in bitcoin price below the USD 3,550 and USD 3,500 support levels. BTC/USD even traded towards the USD 3,400 support where buyers emerged. The price is currently (UTC 08:10 AM) trading in a range below the USD 3,500 resistance and it could be setting up for the next break in the coming sessions. Ethereum price also declined recently and settled below the USD 110 resistance. ETH/USD could accelerate losses if sellers push the price below the USD 105 and USD 102 weekly support levels. More importantly, ripple price trimmed most of its gains from well above USD 0.330 and declined below USD 0.305. XRP/USD is currently struggling to stay above USD 0.300 and it may perhaps drop significantly in the near term. Total market capitalization  After trading close to the USD 3,400 support, bitcoin price  started a short term upside correction. However, there are many barriers for buyers, starting with the USD 3,500 weekly resistance. Above the mentioned weekly resistance, the price is likely to test the next major resistance at USD 3,550. 
A successful daily close above USD 3,550 is needed for buyers to gain traction. On the other hand, if the price fails to break USD 3,500 or USD 3,550, it could decline below the USD 3,400 and USD 3,320 support levels. Ethereum price  failed to surpass the USD 112 resistance recently and traded below the USD 110 support. ETH/USD is currently under a lot of pressure and once sellers clear the USD 105 support, there could be heavy declines toward USD 100 or USD 95.
On the other hand, a break above the USD 110 and USD 112 weekly resistance levels will most likely clear the path for buyers to gain control. Bitcoin cash  failed to stay above the USD 120 support and tested the USD 118 support. BCH/USD is trading with a bearish angle and it might continue to decline towards the USD 115 and USD 112 support levels.
EOS  failed to test the USD 2.50 resistance level and declined below the USD 2.40 support. Buyers are currently defending the USD 2.35 support, with a few positive moves.
Ripple price  performed very well this past week, but it soon trimmed most its gains. XRP/USD broke the USD 0.320 and USD 0.305 support levels. The price is currently trading above USD 0.300 and it could correct higher towards USD 0.305 or USD 0.308. During the past few hours, a few small cap altcoins declined between 5%-12%, including AOA, REP, RVN, STEEM, XEM, DENT and LINK. Out of these, AOA is down around 11% and REP traded lower by 8%. To sum up, the current price action is clearly bearish on bitcoin below the USD 3,500 resistance. BTC/USD must break the USD 3,500 and USD 3,550 resistance levels to start a decent upward move. If not, BTC and altcoins are likely to extend the current downtrend in the coming sessions.

" Despite three positive news for the bitcoin market over the past 24 hours, the price of the number one cryptocurrency appeared more or less indifferent Friday morning.  As of press time (UTC 06:55 AM,) bitcoin’s price was down roughly 1.5% over the last 24 hours, suggesting that traders have become less sensitive to news about what’s really going on in the crypto economy. So, what exactly has happened that would normally propel the price higher? Here is a short summary: VanEck, the exchange traded fund (ETF) provider which has become known in the cryptoverse for its attempts at launching a bitcoin-backed ETF, has resubmitted its bitcoin ETF application to the US Securities and Exchange Commission for review. VanEck’s original application to list a bitcoin-backed ETF was removed from consideration to avoid a probable rejection earlier in January.   If approved, VanEck would be allowed to list the first ETF in the US that is fully backed by “physical” bitcoins in its reserves, which is widely believed to be a huge catalyst for the price of bitcoin. However, the SEC has more than 240 days to decide whether to approve or reject the proposal. As reported on January 30, asset management giant Fidelity Investments is targeting a March launch for its much-anticipated crypto custody solution for financial institutions.  Now, Fidelity has officially confirmed that there is interest from financial institutions for its new product. According to an update published by the company on Thursday, industry players admit that without trusted custodians, there is little financial institutions can do in the crypto space.  “Our conversations with a variety of institutions have served to underscore their clear need for a trusted platform provider in order to engage with digital assets in a meaningful way,” the company said. Boerse Stuttgart Group, the operator of Germany’s second largest stock exchange, on Thursday announced that its crypto trading app is now finally available in app stores for both Apple and Android devices. The stock exchange, which first announced its plans to move into the crypto space in August last year, said that its new “BISON” crypto trading app allows for free-of-charge trading in Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Ripple’s XRP, while also offering storage of the same cryptocurrencies. Instead of charging commissions on trades, the exchange has chosen a model where it instead earns money on the spread between the buy and sell price of the cryptocurrencies it offers.",2019-02-01
" Yesterday, we saw a few recovery signs for bitcoin above the USD 3,400 resistance. Recently, BTC/USD traded above the USD 3,450 resistance, but it remained below the key USD 3,480 and USD 3,500 resistance levels. As long as bitcoin stays below the USD 3,500 resistance, it could resume its decline. On the other hand, ripple performed well recently and traded above the USD 0.312 and USD 0.320 resistance levels. The current (UTC 08:20 AM) price action is positive for ripple, but it must settle above USD 0.320 and 0.322 for bullish continuation. Total market capitalization  There was a slow and steady rise above USD 3,420 in bitcoin price . BTC/USD traded above the USD 3,450 and USD 3,470 resistance levels. However, sellers were able to defend the key USD 3,480 and USD 3,500 resistance levels. The price is currently consolidating near USD 3,450, and it could either test the USD 3,500 resistance or drop back to USD 3,400.
If buyers fail to surpass the USD 3,500 resistance, there could be a fresh decline. The main supports are USD 3,400 and USD 3,380. Ethereum price  started a short term correction and moved above the USD 105 and USD 107 resistance levels. However, ETH/USD is facing a solid resistance near the USD 109 - USD 110 resistance level.
If there is a bearish reaction, the previous resistance near USD 105 might act as a support in the coming sessions. The key support for a major drop is USD 100 - USD 101. Bitcoin cash price  climbed higher and broke the USD 114 and USD 115 resistance levels. BCH/USD tested the USD 120 resistance, where sellers emerged and protected further upsides. The pair is currently correcting lower and it could test the USD 112 support.
EOS  recovered above the USD 2.25 and USD 2.30 resistance levels, with a bullish bias. However, the price failed to surpass the USD 2.35 - USD 2.36 resistance zone and it is currently correcting lower.
Ripple price  was the best performer as it broke the USD 0.310 and USD 0.320 resistance levels. XRP/USD even broke the USD 0.330 resistance, but it failed to hold gains. The price is now trading below the USD 0.320 level, with an immediate support at USD 0.315 and USD 0.312. The main hurdles are USD 0.320, USD 0.322 and USD 0.328. During the past few hours, a few small cap altcoins moved higher and gained between 5% - 10%, including AOA, BCN, MIOTA, MONA and KMD. On the other hand, a few posted losses such as HOT, NPXS, DENT, PAI and WAVES. Overall, bitcoin price is showing a few positive signs above the USD 3,400 pivot level. However, BTC/USD must break the USD 3,480 and USD 3,500 resistance levels to jump into a positive zone. If not, there is a risk of a fresh drop in bitcoin and altcoins in the near term.

" The prospect of Bitcoin’s price falling under USD 3,000 sounds scary to many investors, and with good reason: keeping in mind that the all-time high was almost USD 20,000 only slightly more than a year ago and that the price has been almost exclusively falling since then, yet another dip certainly seems like the worst nightmare. But is it truly an apocalyptic scenario or something more mundane? The community is divided on this matter. In the apocalyptic corner of the ring is Vinny Lingham, general partner at crypto fund Multicoin Capital and the CEO at blockchain company Civic. “If we break below USD 3,000 for Bitcoin, ‘crypto winter’ will become ‘crypto nuclear winter’...” he wrote on Twitter. He has also previously stated that, “Historically, Bitcoin bear markets don’t end when the market indicates that there is a bottom. They typically end when the market indicates that there is no bottom…” However, Lingham did not explain his slightly pessimistic view on the price of Bitcoin. Other members of the cryptoverse are theorizing that the Chinese New Year could bring the price down, as that has already happened last year around that time. Back then, Bitcoin fell from USD 11,786 to USD 6,430. The Chinese New Year has often been considered an important factor for change in Bitcoin price, but usually in an upwards trend: from 2015, a trend had been set where Bitcoin loses its value in January and then in February regains it back, but this was broken in 2018 when the bear run continued throughout the year.  But with the ban on cryptocurrencies in China, the impact their lunar new year could have on the markets is doubtful. That is also what many in the community believe: “There’s a difference between a market retracement and a date on a calendar. No correlation expected,” says Reddit user u/RossMacdonald.  In the other corner of the ring are many that believe Bitcoin dipping below USD 3,000 is to be expected and nothing out of the ordinary. One of them is crypto researcher and analyst Willy Woo, who recently tweeted, “The were a lot of coins bought in the USD 2,200 - USD 2,800 range on the way up, I can concur this is the likely accumulation bottom, I'm picking in the price will settle lower part of this range -  doesn't preclude a capitulation wick lower, but that wick is not 100%.” Forbes contributor and trader Naeem Aslam is another one who doesn’t see a reason for panic. “There is still strong hope for this year. Anyone with a desire to get approval for their [Bitcoin] ETF has plenty of time to submit a new application,” adding that, “In my mind, there is no doubt that an ETF approval would be a positive event for the markets and in fact, it is not far-fetched to assume that many other significant news would also follow around the same time. This is because everyone wants to utilise the power of tailwind and a sequence of good news should propel the price even higher.” ""The market sentiment towards Bitcoin is very neutral and is now approaching a negative range. Bitcoin has a weak social support, which is on a downward trend, and any new price drop could now make Bitcoin enter a negative sentiment range,"" Pierre-Alexandre Picard, co-founder of Predicoin, a crypto market sentiment data analysis service, told Cryptonews.com. The company measures the market sentiment by calculating the SentScore, which aggregates the sentiment from news, social media, technical analysis, viral trends, and coin fundamentals based upon their proprietary algorithms. According to Pierre-Alexandre, the recent price drop pushed SentScore below the neutral score of 5, which means that Bitcoin ""sentiment support"" is getting weaker. Meanwhile, the news about ETFs and other institutionals in crypto haven’t been very good lately. Bakkt, the long awaited futures trading platform developed by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), has not yet launched due to the government shutdown in the US. Others are also pulling back or at least displaying wariness, as they seem to wait to see how the markets will move before making a decision. The approvement from traditional finance institutions has long been considered a deciding factor in the future of crypto assets. Meanwhile, despite the news that US-based mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments may be aiming for a launch of its highly anticipated crypto custody solution in March this year, bitcoin’s reaction was muted today.  But the crypto community is not exactly clinging onto the opinion of traditionalists. Interestingly, a Twitter poll by user @tradingroomapp, that numbered more than 2,700 respondents, shows that 56% of them would actually prefer the price to drop below the support line of USD 3,000 so they can “restock” at a cheaper entry point. Are you praying for #Bitcoin to dump back to 3000 & lower so you can Buy big bags? And of course, there are those with a different perspective. “If you want to get rich quick then you’re in the wrong place. My outlook is long-term investment,” writes u/getStefano in a Reddit thread. As reported this week, famous Bitcoin bull and head of Fundstrat Global Advisors Tom Lee is steadfast in that USD 25,000 per Bitcoin forecast is a good value for the cryptocurrency, but that the timing “may be difficult.”",2019-01-30
" Despite the news that US-based mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments may be aiming for a launch of its highly anticipated crypto custody solution in March this year, bitcoin’s reaction was muted.  As of press time Wednesday morning, the price of the number one cryptocurrency was up roughly 1% over the past 24 hours, after seeing a sell-off of roughly 4% earlier in the week. Fidelity, which is the fourth largest asset manager in the world with USD 7.2 trillion in assets under management, last year launched Fidelity Digital Assets as a separate company to handle all things blockchain related that Fidelity is involved in. This includes crypto custody, trade execution, and support for various institutional clients looking to dip their toe into the world of digital assets. Now, the company is making progress with its digital asset custody solution, three anonymous sources at “firms that spoke with Fidelity in the past several weeks” told Bloomberg. According to the sources, bitcoin custody will be coming up starting in March, followed by custody of ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform. When asked for a comment, Fidelity itself did not offer much to back up the claims from the sources: “We are currently serving a select set of eligible clients as we continue to build our initial solutions. Over the next several months, we will thoughtfully engage with and prioritize prospective clients based on needs, jurisdiction and other factors,” the company said. Meanwhile, after the launch of the much-anticipated Bakkt crypto futures trading platform has been postponed to an unspecified date, the cryptoverse is suspicious that it might happen with Fidelity, also:   @Fidelity cant fool us. March means september of 2022. We learned this from @Bakkt ..fool me once..i cant get fooled again. However, if the news is true, this might be a significant event for the crypto market. Fidelity is much better placed to know and understand institutional client demand than the upstarts.So if they are pushing forward, thats a big indication of a market need. The lack of proper third-party custody solutions for cryptocurrencies has been widely considered an obstacle for financial institutions looking to get into the world of crypto, as this is a strict requirement from financial regulators around the world. However, Fidelity’s CEO Abigail Johnson is known as crypto-friendly, and has made it a mission for her company to offer these solutions to the rest of Wall Street.  Meanwhile, as reported in December, it seems that Wall Street is in limbo regarding its cryptocurrency plans, even when some crypto scene players are calling the bottom. However, this silence of the institutional players might be illusory.  Tyler Welmans, Deloitte UK's blockchain lead, told Cryptonews.com that he expects continued growth in corporate investment in crypto-related platforms and services, with the recent slump in the market arguably making crypto as a whole more attractive to certain investors. ""With respect to public networks and cryptocurrencies, there are few signs banks are investing directly in cryptocurrencies, although plenty of niche investment funds are,” he said earlier this January. “However, we continue to see strong growth in the development of cryptocurrency-linked products and services, such as exchange trading, futures and custody services.""",2019-01-30
" Bitcoin remained in a bearish zone in the past few sessions and declined below the USD 3,450 and USD 3,400 support levels. BTC/USD is clearly trading in a downtrend and it may continue to bleed in the near term. The next key support is at USD 3,250, where buyers are likely to take a stand. Similarly, ethereum declined heavily and settled below the USD 110 support. If ETH/USD breaks the USD 100 support, there could be nasty losses in the coming session. Finally, ripple price settled below USD 0.300 and it seems like it may trade towards the USD 0.275 level. Total market capitalization  There was a downside extension below the USD 3,450 support in bitcoin price . BTC/USD even broke the USD 3,400 support and traded close to the USD 3,350 support. The price is down more than 2% (UTC 08:20 AM) and it seems like there could be more losses below USD 3,350 and USD 3,320 in the near term.
On the upside, there are many hurdles for buyers near the USD 3,420 and USD 3,450 levels. Having said that, a successful close above the USD 3,500 level is must for buyers to push bitcoin back in a positive zone. Ethereum price  settled below the USD 110 and 108 support levels. ETH/USD traded close to the USD 100 support and it is currently consolidating losses.
If there is a proper break and close below USD 100, the price may decline sharply towards the USD 95 or 92 support level. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the USD 108 level, followed by USD 110. Bitcoin cash price  failed to hold the USD 112 and 110 supports. BCH/USD declined sharply and tested the USD 105 support. The price is currently trading in a range, but there is a risk of more losses towards USD 100 or USD 95.
EOS  tumbled below the USD 2.40 support. Sellers pushed the price below the USD 2.30 and USD 2.20 support levels. The next stop for sellers could be USD 2.12, followed by USD 2.05.
Ripple price  is down more than 4% and it broke the USD 0.290 support level. XRP/USD tested the USD 0.280 support and it is currently consolidating losses. It seems like sellers are eyeing further losses below the USD 0.280 and USD 0.275 levels in the near term. During the past few hours, many small cap altcoins declined and posted losses more than 8%, including BNB, FCT, DGD, KMD, NPXS, ZIL, POLY, IOST, XLM, XTZ and XEM. Out of these, BNB and FCT are down close to 10%. Overall, there are many bearish signs on bitcoin charts, suggesting more losses below the USD 3,400 support. If BTC/USD continues to bleed, there are chances of a sharp decline towards the USD 3,250 or 3,160 support level. Similarly, ethereum may perhaps break the USD 100 and USD 95 support levels.

" Famous Bitcoin bull and head of Fundstrat Global Advisors Tom Lee is steadfast in that USD 25,000 per Bitcoin forecast is a good value for the cryptocurrency, but that the timing “may be difficult.”  He has previously pulled out of the forecasting game - but noted that “we will cease to provide any timeframes for the realization of fair value,” which he stayed true to, as he gives no timeframe for this prediction. Speaking to Fox Business, he commented on his initial forecast that the price would reach USD 25,000 by the end of 2018: “It’s a huge disappointment, neither came in terms of price or calendar. Last year was a year where the crypto bubble was really adjusting [...] we thought Bitcoin would sort of survive that. It didn’t. It got sold off with the rest of the market.” When asked if he wished he had never made the prediction in the first place, Lee explained, “Strangely, I just think that’s a good, fair value for Bitcoin, but the timing of that is going to be difficult [...] First, Bitcoin has had 70% pullbacks four times already in its 10 year history, and it’s recovered to new all-time highs every time. To me, it’s resilient. [Crypto is becoming] an asset class, especially driven by millennials and outside the US, there’s an interest in a digital currency, digital asset store of value that’s not traditional money.” Still, he makes absolutely no predictions on when that might be, or when the bear market might end. In a note to clients, dated December 13th, Lee wrote, “We are tired of people asking us about target prices [...] Because of the inherent volatility in crypto, we will cease to provide any timeframes for the realization of fair value.” Since then, he has remained quiet about the price - until now. He previously started out by saying that Bitcoin could climb back to USD 20,000 by mid-year and even reach USD 25,000 by the end of December. He later amended this end-of-the-year forecast, pulling it down to a USD 22,000 - USD 20,000 range. Then in November, when Bitcoin was trading at around USD 5,500, Lee was certain the price would triple in the remaining month and a half. None of that happened, but he - like a good part of the crypto community - remains ever optimistic. Sounds like they're ""watchers"" not buyers...

" This past week, we discussed a few important supports for bitcoin near the USD 3,550, USD 3,500 and USD 3,475 levels. Recently, BTC/USD failed to break the USD 3,600 and USD 3,620 resistance levels, resulting in a fresh drop below the USD 3,500 support area. The price even broke the USD 3,475 support to move into a bearish zone. Similarly, there were heavy losses in ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, tron, eos and other major altcoins in the past few sessions. Clearly, the market turned red and it seems like there could be more losses in bitcoin and altcoins. Total market capitalization  After buyers failed to gain momentum above USD 3,600, bitcoin price  started a major downward move. BTC/USD broke the USD 3,550, USD 3,500 and USD 3,475 support levels. The pair traded close to the USD 3,400 level and it is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) consolidating losses. On the upside, the previous support near USD 3,500 may now act as a resistance. The main weekly resistance remains near the USD 3,600 level. 
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,400, below which the price may trade towards the USD 3,220 support level in the near term. Ethereum price  fell sharply below the USD 115 and 112 support levels. ETH/USD even traded below the USD 108 support and moved into a bearish zone.
If there is an upside correction, the previous support near USD 112 might act as a strong resistance. The main weekly resistances are near USD 115 and USD 118. To the downside, buyers could put up a strong fight near the USD 100 - USD 102 support area. Bitcoin cash  fell significantly below the USD 125 support. BCH/USD is down more than 10% and it is currently trading near USD 110. If it continues to move down, the next key support awaits at USD 105. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 115, followed by the USD 120 barrier. 
EOS  declined more than 5% and broke the USD 2.40 and USD 2.30 support levels. The price is under pressure, with an immediate support near the USD 2.25 level.
Ripple price  faced a solid rise in selling pressure, resulting in a drop below the key USD 0.302 and USD 0.300 support levels. In the short term, there could be a minor upside correction, but the USD 0.306 and USD 0.308 levels are likely to prevent gains. Despite heavy bearish moves in bitcoin and ethereum, a few small cap altcoins gained traction, including HOT, NPXS and AOA. Out of these, NPXS gained more than 20% and HOT is up around 18%. Overall, bitcoin traded below key supports, increasing bearish pressure on buyers below USD 3,500. If BTC/USD continues to struggle, there are possibilities of more losses in the coming days. Altcoins such as ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash might also continue to struggle along with bitcoin.

Hackers had reportedly managed to breach at least six user accounts, getting away with more than BTC 7.9 (USD 27,000.) According to a reddit post from the company, “an unauthorized source was able to access and send transactions from a number of affected accounts” during the attack. The company further said it identified the problem, and that it was related to “a feature powered by a third-party software.” According to reports online, the problem appears to have been related to LocalBitcoins’ discussion forum. LocalBitcoins also said that they are still working to determine how many users was affected by the breach, adding that “so far, six cases have been confirmed.” The company further insisted in the post that it is safe to use their service again, but added that all users are encouraged to enable two-factor authentication. “Your LocalBitcoins accounts are currently safe to log in and use - we encourage you to enable Two-factor authentication, if you have not yet.

" This week, bitcoin price struggled to gain bullish momentum and settled below the USD 3,600 support level. BTC/USD is currently (UTC 08:10 AM) consolidating in a tiny range and the same support at USD 3,600 is now acting as a solid resistance. Going forward, the price may continue to trade in a range before the next wave either above USD 3,600 or below USD 3,500. Similarly, ethereum is finding it tough to break the USD 120 resistance. If it continues to struggle, there is a risk of a downside break below the USD 110 support. Ripple price is trading in a bearish zone below USD 0.320 and it may slowly decline towards USD 0.310. Total market capitalization  Recently, bitcoin price  found support near the USD 3,500 level and it recovered above the USD 3,550 level. However, BTC/USD is struggling to surpass the USD 3,600 resistance, above which buyers might take control and they could push the price towards the USD 3,650 and USD 3,700 resistance levels.
On the downside, an initial support lies at USD 3,520, below which the price may decline to USD 3,475 or even USD 3,400 in the coming sessions. Ethereum price  is trading in a tight range below the key USD 120 resistance. There were many attempts by ETH/USD to surpass the USD 118 - USD 120 resistance zone, but it failed.
On the downside, the USD 112 and USD 110 support levels are significant. If sellers succeed in pushing the price below USD 110, the price could drop towards the USD 100 level. Bitcoin cash price  spiked above the USD 130 resistance, but there was no hourly close. BCH/USD retreated from highs and it seems like sellers could push the price towards the USD 125 support in the near term.
EOS  is trading with a positive bias as it broke the USD 2.40 and 2.42 resistance levels. If buyers remain in action, there are high possibilities of a test of the USD 2.50 and 2.56 resistance levels.
Ripple price  is under pressure below the USD 0.320 support level. XRP/USD is following a bearish pattern and it could continue to move down towards the USD 0.311 or USD 0.310 support level. On the upside, the main resistances for buyers are at USD 0.318 and USD 0.320. Despite range moves in bitcoin and ethereum, a few small cap altcoins traded higher and gained between 6%-20%, including AOA, LKY, HOT, NPXS and ELA. Out of these, AOA is up more than 15% and LKY gained close to 11%. To sum up, bitcoin price is currently trading in a tight range between USD 3,500 and USD 3,600. BTC/USD will most likely make the next significant move above USD 3,600 as long as there is no daily close below the USD 3,475 support.

" There were mostly range moves in the past few sessions and bitcoin struggled to break the USD 3,600 resistance level. It seems like BTC/USD could make the next move in the coming sessions, which could be either above USD 3,600 or below USD 3,500. Similarly, ethereum is preparing for the next key break either above USD 120 or towards USD 100. Ripple price may follow BTC and ETH and it could either gain bullish momentum above USD 0.320 or decline to revisit the USD 0.300 support area in the near term. Total market capitalization  After a decent recovery, bitcoin price  faced a strong resistance near the USD 3,600 level. BTC/USD corrected lower and tested the USD 3,550 support level. The current price action is slightly bearish, but it seems like the price is preparing for the next key break either above USD 3,600 or below USD 3,500 and USD 3,475.
If there is an upside break above the 3,600 resistance, the price is likely to rally towards the USD 3,750 and USD 3,800 resistance levels. Alternatively, there could be a bearish break below the USD 3,500 and 3,475 supports. Ethereum price  is facing a tough resistance near the USD 120 level, above which buyers are likely to gain strength for a solid upward move. The next major resistance is at USD 128, followed by USD 130.
On the other hand, if there is a bearish reaction below the USD 112 support, there are high chances of an extended decline towards the USD 100 handle. Bitcoin cash price  recently tested the USD 125 support and it is currently moving higher. BCH/USD must move above the USD 130, USD 132 and USD 135 resistance levels to start a sustained uptrend in the near term.
EOS  seems to be facing a strong selling interest near the USD 2.50 level. Therefore, to move into a bullish zone, EOS buyers need to clear the USD 2.50 and USD 2.55 hurdles.
Ripple price  is trading well below the key USD 0.320 resistance level. If XRP/USD continues to struggle near USD 0.320, there is a risk of a downside break towards the USD 0.300 and USD 0.295 support levels. Recently, a few small cap altcoins gained traction and moved up sharply, including HOT, NPXS, PIVX, DGD, ELF and DCN. Out of these, HOT is up more than 35% and NPXS gained close to 22%. Overall, bitcoin price is setting up for the next significant move either above USD 3,600 or below USD 3,500. The technical structure is slightly bearish, but considering the current oversold conditions, there are chances of an upward move in BTC/USD, ethereum, and other altcoins in the near term.

" Crypto pioneer and convicted felon Charlie Shrem believes that Bitcoin is “the most durable currency for a nuclear war,” according to a post he wrote. “If the unthinkable happens, Bitcoin would be a highly durable currency during nuclear war, as compared to fiat currency, which would fail for multiple reasons,” he added. However not everyone is convinced by this analysis. The controversial Bitcoin evangelist, who was sentenced to two years in prison for aiding and abetting the operation of an unlicensed money-transmitting business related to the dark web Silk Road marketplace, says nuclear warheads would decimate centralized banking organizations and render them useless. As a result, online bank balances would become meaningless once banks and computers get destroyed.  But Bitcoin would certainly survive such an ordeal: “As long as there is at least one node running Bitcoin, the Bitcoin network will continue to function. It is highly likely that many Bitcoin nodes would survive even the worst nuclear attack since nodes are scattered worldwide, and they could communicate with each other via satellite internet.” Not only is Bitcoin “uniquely suited” to survive a nuclear war, but it would also thrive in those adversarial conditions. “Even in a small nuclear war the ensuing calamity could cause fiats to hyperinflate, as governments print tremendous amounts of cash to fund the war while economies simultaneously slow, and investors crash the stock market out of fear since they will be selling their stocks for the cash they need to survive. Bitcoin is completely decentralized, and a more durable type of money than fiat during nuclear war as explained above, so as hyperinflation devalues fiat worldwide, people would be buying Bitcoin and Bitcoin’s price would likely rise rapidly.” Twitter users were not so positive about this analysis: A nuclear war will destroy all electrical systems rendering blockchain and Bitcoin obsolete, Gold would be the standard again..For the handful of people left alive.. __ This is real hopium charlie, all will be devastated but bitcoin will survive. 😃 __ This is our only shot at it, if it goes down that way, you better just pray that you can reach a nuclear bunker in time, which many people won't have access to. If bitcoin can not change the world before we destroy it, it will become irrelevant for a very long time. __ BTC requires a ton of electricity to keep the network going. Where will this electricity come from in the event of global nuclear war when all of the power grids are wiped out? $Nano would fare better becaue the whole network can be powered from a single wind turbine. __ Shrem spend almost two years in prison due to his involvement with the Silk Road marketplace - from December 2014 until June 2016. Additionally, in September 2018, the famous crypto entrepreneurs, Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, sued Shrem for USD 32 million, claiming he stole 5,000 bitcoin from them in 2012. “Either Shrem has been incredibly lucky and successful since leaving prison, or — more likely - he ‘acquired’ his six properties, two Maseratis, two powerboats and other holdings with the appreciated value of the 5,000 Bitcoin he stole,” the Winklevoss twins alleged in their lawsuit. However, Shrem denies these allegations. He is also the founder of the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Bitinstant. In 2017, he joined digital wallet Jaxx as its director of business and community development. Later that year, he founded cryptocurrency advisory firm CryptoIQ. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies are not so bulletproof as Shrem would perhaps believe. Theoretically, quantum computers could steal your Bitcoin - but luckily, that is still some ways away. However, Bitcoin could well be made redundant by copycats in three scenarios brought by TechnologyReview last year.",2019-01-23
" Yesterday, we discussed make-or-break levels for bitcoin. BTC/USD managed to stay above the USD 3,500 support level and it recently started an upside correction. The price recovered above the USD 3,540 and USD 3,550 resistance levels, but still there are many hurdles on the upside. Ethereum also found support near the USD 110 level and later recovered above USD 115. However, ripple price is struggling to gain bullish momentum and it may continue to face a strong resistance near USD 0.318 and USD 0.320. The technical structure is still bearish, but there are a few positive signs on the hourly chart of BTC. Total market capitalization  After a sharp decline below USD 3,500, bitcoin price  found a strong buying interest. BTC/USD corrected higher and broke the USD 3,540 and USD 3,550 resistance levels. The price is currently up around 1%, with an immediate resistance near the USD 3,580 and USD 3,600 levels.
If there is an upside break above USD 3,580 and USD 3,600, buyers could gain control and there may be more upsides towards the USD 3,700 level. If not, there could be a fresh drop towards the USD 3,500 support. Ethereum price  tested the key USD 110 support and later recovered above the USD 115 resistance. ETH/USD is currently trading above USD 117, with an immediate resistance at USD 120. 
Once buyers succeed in gaining strength above USD 120, the price could rally towards the USD 124 and 127 levels. On the downside, the main supports are seen near the USD 115 and USD 113 levels. Bitcoin cash price  gained traction after testing the USD 115 level. BCH/USD bounced back above USD 125 and it is currently up more than 6%. The next key resistance is at USD 130, above which the price may 
rise towards the USD 136 level.
EOS  is up close to 5% and it seems like the price may soon test the USD 2.45 and USD 2.50 resistance levels. On the downside, the main support is at USD 2.40, followed by USD 2.32.
Ripple price  seems to be struggling near the USD 0.318 and USD 0.320 resistance levels. XRP/USD must surpass the USD 0.320 barrier for a decent recovery towards the USD 0.330 and USD 0.335 levels. If not, it could revisit the USD 0.305 support level. During the past few hours, many small cap altcoins gained and moved up by more than 8%, including LRC, RVN, WAVES, RDD, BTM, STEEM and THETA. Out of these, LRC is up more than 23% and RVN gained close to 21%. To sum up, the current price action is positive and bitcoin may slowly climb towards the USD 3,580 and USD 3,600 resistance levels. However, BTC/USD needs to gain strength above USD 3,600 for a sustained upward move. If not, there could be a fresh decline in bitcoin price and altcoins in the near term.

" Earlier this week, we saw bearish moves in bitcoin below the USD 3,700 and USD 3,650 support levels. BTC/USD even broke the USD 3,600 support and later started trading in a tight range above the USD 3,500 support. The current price action is neutral-to-bearish, but the USD 3,500 support holds the key for the next move. If buyers fail to keep the price above USD 3,500 and USD 3,475, the price could resume its decline towards USD 3,400 and USD 3,350. Similarly, ethereum price must hold the USD 113 support area to start a decent recovery. Ripple price is showing a few positive signs, but a break above USD 0.322 is needed for buyers to gain traction. Total market capitalization  After testing the USD 3,475 level, bitcoin price  recovered above the USD 3,500 level and later started consolidating losses. BTC/USD is currently trading in a tight range above USD 3,500, with an immediate resistance at USD 3,550. Should there be a break above USD 3,550, the price may attempt to surpass the USD 3,600 resistance.
On the other hand, if there is a downside break below the USD 3,500 and USD 3,475 support, the next stop for sellers could be USD 3,400. Ethereum price  is trading above the USD 113 support level, with range moves. ETH/USD must settle above the USD 118 and USD 120 resistance levels to avoid further declines.
If it fails to move past USD 120, there is a risk of a downside break below the USD 110 and USD 108 support levels in the near term. On the upside, a break above USD 120 might lead the price to USD 126. Bitcoin cash price  dipped below the USD 120 support recently before recovering a few points. BCH/USD is clearly facing an increase in selling pressure and it could continue to move down towards the USD 118 and USD 115 levels.
EOS  is trading nicely above the USD 2.30 support level. Buyers need to gain pace above the USD 2.38 and USD 2.40 resistance levels to avoid a bearish break below the USD 2.30 and USD 2.25 supports.
Ripple price  recovered a few points, but it is facing a lot of hurdles near the USD 0.318 and USD 0.320 levels. Having said that, only a close above USD 0.322 could push XRP/USD back in a positive zone. Despite range moves in the market, a few small cap altcoins gained between 6%-30%, including BCZERO, FCT, XIN, TRX and LINK. Out of these, BCZERO is up more than 28% and FCT gained more than 30%. Overall, bitcoin price is trading just above the key USD 3,500 support. BTC/USD may soon make the next move either above USD 3,600 or below USD 3,500. Similarly, ethereum could either climb above USD 120 or break the USD 110 support in the coming sessions.

" A team of researchers from UK university Cambridge have found a way to track stolen bitcoins even after they’re laundered, giving law enforcement an entirely new and powerful way to track the proceeds of cryptocurrency crime for the first time. The algorithm, called Taintchain, is based on a 19th century UK law, which established the first in, first out (FIFO) principle, upon which many cryptocurrency launderings seem to operate. Although Bitcoin, like many other cryptocurrencies, is pseudonymous instead of anonymous, this does not help much in tracking stolen funds - only in identifying the owner of the address which holds the funds after they have already been tracked down. Although the blockchain is a transparent ledger where every transaction can be seen and traced, the units themselves (bitcoins and satoshis) are impossible to track as they have no serial numbers or other individual identifiers.  The usual way of hiding the tracks of stolen bitcoins is by laundering: putting, for example, four stolen bitcoins and six clean ones in a single wallet. Then, the malicious actors split up the 10 bitcoins and transfer them to a large number of other accounts, making it impossible to tell which ones are clean and which ones are not.  Tendrils of crime: visualizing the diffusion of stolen bitcoin:  The research team, made up of Ross Anderson, Ilia Shumailov, and Mansoor Ahmed came up with a system that is based on the FIFO principle, which stipulates that when funds are divided from an account (like when a bank or other financial institution collapses), the first person to have paid in is the first person to be paid out. The new Taintchain algorithm applies this principle to bitcoin wallets: if the first bitcoins paid into the wallet are stolen, then the first ones paid out are considered stolen too. Although malicious actors use several different patterns that are supposed to hide the funds, the algorithm is immune to them due to observing the FIFO principle. Of course, that insight immediately suggests a way for malicious actors to hide their activity from Taintchain analysis by randomizing the way they pay out from wallets. Meanwhile, the darknet markets are still thriving, in spite of the law enforcement’s best efforts. Although some markets get closed down, others pop up all over the place. However, according to a report by blockchain analysis company Chainalysis, “Darknet market activity is relatively price inelastic; that is, you don’t see a drop in this type of activity when cryptocurrency prices fall. In fact, in 2018, darknet market activity and overall market performance had an inverse relationship.” ______",2019-01-21
" This past week, we saw a tiny recovery in bitcoin above the USD 3,650 level. However, the BTC/USD failed to hold gains above the USD 3,700 - USD 3,720 resistance area, resulting in a fresh decline in the past few days. The price declined sharply and traded below the USD 3,650, USD 3,600 and USD 3,550 support levels to move into a bearish zone. Similarly, ethereum declined heavily from well above the USD 125 level to well below USD 115. Ripple price followed the bearish sentiment and tumbled below the USD 0.322 and USD 0.320 support levels. The current (UTC 08:30 AM) market sentiment is short term bearish and there are possibilities of more losses in the coming sessions. Total market capitalization  After topping near the USD 3,720 level, bitcoin price  declined sharply below USD 3,600 support. BTC/USD even broke the USD 3,550 and USD 3,500 support levels. It traded towards the USD 3,475 later recovered above USD 3,500. The price is down more than 4% and it remains at a risk of a downside break below USD 3,500 and 3,450 in the near term.
On the upside, the previous supports near USD 3,550, USD 3,580 and USD 3,600 are likely to act as major hurdles if there is a short term correction. Ethereum price  tumbled once sellers pushed the price below the USD 122 and USD 120 support. ETH/USD declined below USD 115 and traded close to the USD 113 support level.
The price is currently correcting higher towards the USD 116 and USD 118 resistance levels. To start a proper recovery, buyers need to push the price above the USD 120 and USD 125 weekly resistance levels. On the downside, the main weekly supports are USD 110 and USD 102. Bitcoin cash  failed to stay above the USD 125 support and declined more than 5%. BCH/USD is currently trading near the USD 120 support and it seems like it could extend the current decline towards the USD 115 or USD 112 support level. 
EOS  is down more than 5% and it is currently facing resistance near the USD 2.35 level. On the upside, there are many hurdles near USD 2.40 and USD 2.50. The main weekly support is seen near USD 2.25.
Ripple price  dived below the USD 0.320 support to enter a bearish zone. XRP/USD is now trading in a bearish zone, with an immediate support at USD 0.311 and 0.306. During the past few sessions, many small cap altcoins declined more than 8%, including HOT, REP, WAN, MKR, POWR, R, WAX, KMD, NEXO and AION. Out of these, HOT declined around 18% and REP is down close to 11%. Meanwhile, PAY ralied more than 25%. To sum up, bitcoin is back in a negative territory below USD 3,600. BTC/USD may decline further if buyers fail to gather momentum above the USD 3,550, USD 3,600 and USD 3,620 resistance levels. Similarly, ethereum and ripple are likely to extend losses if bitcoin price slides further below USD 3,500 and USD 3,450.

" Coinstar, the company known for its coin-counting machines found in malls and supermarkets, has announced a partnership with bitcoin ATM operator Coinme to enable bitcoin-buying for cash at its kiosks across the US. Coinstar owns more than 20,000 coin-counting machines in nine countries around the world, but bitcoin purchases will only be available at selected kiosks in the US for now. Further, purchases can only be made with US dollar bills, in any amount up to USD 2,500 for each 24-hour period. Coins and foreign currency are not accepted at this time, according to a statement published by Coinstar. Once the money is deposited into the machine, the customer will receive a voucher with a bitcoin redemption code. The customer will then need to go to Coinme’s website to open an account and redeem the bitcoin. “Bitcoin is now accessible at your local grocery store via Coinstar kiosks, and this offering will make it even easier for consumers to participate in this dynamic new economy,” Coinme’s co-founder Neil Bergquist said in a comment. Unfortunately, buying bitcoin for cash remains a fairly expensive option. Although the two companies do not go into detail on this subject, Coinme’s website reveals that there is a 4% fee to use the new service. Compared to the average buying fee at bitcoin ATMs in 2018, however, Coinme’s fee is certainly in the lower end of the spectrum. As Cryptonews.com reported last year, the average buy fee at Bitcoin ATM’s stood at 9.13%, according to Coinatmradar.com. That compares with Coinbase’s 1.49% fee for US users. These fees obviously come on top of the spread, or the difference between the buy and sell price of bitcoin on the exchange that is used. In other words, bitcoin ATMs may have a role in spreading awareness to a new audience, but it certainly doesn’t come cheap. Meanwhile, as reported in November, French fintech company Keplerk made it possible for tobacco shop customers in France to buy bitcoins. The initiative affects 24,000 tobacco shops in the country where bitcoins are offered as vouchers, which can be cashed in via Keplerk’s wallet. The company takes a 7% cut on every transaction as commission fees.

" By adding new clients and cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin payment processor BitPay has managed to process USD 1 billion in transactions in 2018, or second year in a row, despite the market drop last year.  The company claims that it has set a new record for transaction fee revenue by adding new customers like Dish Networks, HackerOne, and the State of Ohio. However, it didn't disclose its revenue. Stephen Pair, Co-founder and CEO of BitPay, said that “To process over USD 1 billion for a second year in a row despite Bitcoin’s large price drop shows that Bitcoin is being used to solve real pain points around the world.” Sean Rolland, Head of Product of BitPay, also adds, “Bitcoin has the network effect around the world and we are still extremely bullish on Bitcoin and the Bitcoin ecosystem.”  BitPay’s B2B [business-to-business] business also had a record year as it grew almost 255% from the previous year as law firms, data center providers, and IT vendors signed up to accept Bitcoin, the company stated without providing any financials. The company, which has been in business for more than seven years, has also set a record for reducing payment error rates. The dollar volume lost to cryptocurrency payment errors reportedly dropped from over 8% (in December 2017) to well under 1% of BitPay’s total dollar volume processed. Although the payment processor remains focused on Bitcoin, they have also added support for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), as well as stablecoins like the USD Coin (USDC), Gemini Dollar (GUSD), and Paxos Standard Token (PAX). In other improvements, BitPay also states that they have increased their number of employees by 78% in 2018, bringing it to close to 80 people. They have also raised USD 40 million in a Series B funding round led by investors such as Menlo Ventures, Capital Nine, G Squared and others, which brought the company’s total raised capital to over USD 70 million. As reported by Cryptonews.com, from February to August last year, the amount of bitcoin spent per month through 17 surveyed bitcoin payments processors ranged from around 16,500 to almost 20,000, only falling to around 14,500 in September. However, the number for September can still be revised upwards, as it happened earlier last year.  Also, BitPay has revealed that the average value of a retail purchase made using BTC has increased last year. In 2016, the average amount spent by someone buying something with bitcoin was USD 107.66, while in 2017 the average rose to USD 347.84. In 2018, by contrast, the average climbed to USD 682.23.  You can find data that breaks down spending by the type of purchase here. However, part of the community is still not a fan of BitPay. This is due to several reasons: back in August 2017, BitPay signed the New York Agreement, which wanted to put an end to Bitcoin’s long-lasting scaling debate by increasing the block capacity through activating Segregated Witness (SegWit2x) and then doubling the block size. However, most Bitcoin maximalists refused to sign this, especially as those who agreed had no intention of changing the name of the coin that would inevitably split off the Bitcoin blockchain. For all intents and purposes, the companies behind SegWit2x appeared to be set to claim this coin as the “real” Bitcoin, while the coin that follows the current Bitcoin protocol won’t be. Another problem that users have with BitPay is the matter of addresses. The company uses a special address format, which is incompatible with many wallets and is said to cause users to lose their funds when converting the address to something recognized.",2019-01-17

BTC/USD is currently up around 0.5% to USD 3,575, with an immediate resistance at USD 3,600. A successful break above the USD 3,650 level is needed for a decent upward move towards the USD 3,750 and USD 3,800 resistances.
On the other hand, if buyers fail to gain strength, there could be a sharp bearish reaction below USD 3,550, USD 3,500 and USD 3,480 in the near term. Ethereum price  tested the USD 116 and USD 118 support levels recently and stayed above the USD 115 pivot level. ETH/USD is slowly moving higher, but a break above USD 125 and USD 128 is required to kick start a move towards the USD 140 level.
On the downside, the USD 118 and USD 116 levels are decent supports. However, a break below USD 115 may push the price back in a bearish zone. Bitcoin cash price  is currently consolidating above the USD 120 and USD 122 support levels. An initial resistance is at USD 130, above which there are chances of a solid upward move towards the USD 140 and USD 145 levels.
EOS  is up around 1% and it is trading near the USD 2.40 level. On the upside, the main resistance is at USD 2.50 followed by USD 2.60. 
Ripple price  tested the key USD 0.320 support on a few occasions, but there was no bearish break. XRP/USD is slowly rising towards USD 0.325 and USD 0.330, above which the price may gain strength for a test of USD 0.375. During the past few hours, many small cap altcoins registered solid gains, including REP, LRC, POWR, SNT, STEEM and WAN. Out of these, REP rallied more than 50%, LRC is up close to 30%, and POWR gained around 24%. Overall, bitcoin is trading in a tight range above the key USD 3,550 and USD 3,540 support levels. The next move in BTC/USD could be either towards USD 3,800 or below USD 3,400 in the coming sessions. Ethereum and ripple may trade sideways before the next major move either bearish or bullish.

" Yesterday, we saw a short term recovery above the USD 3,600 level in bitcoin. However, BTC/USD failed to retain strength above the USD 3,650 level and later reacted to the downside. The main reason for the recent bearish moves was the postponed Ethereum Constantinople hard fork. ETH/USD dipped more than 6% and traded below the USD 125 support level. Ripple price also trimmed its recent gains and declined below USD 0.325 before buyers appeared near the USD 0.320 level. The current (UTC 08:20 AM) price action is slightly bearish, suggesting range moves in bitcoin and altcoins in the coming sessions. Total market capitalization  There was a rejection pattern formed near the USD 3,670 level and bitcoin price  declined below USD 3,600. BTC/USD even traded below the USD 3,550 level before it found support near USD 3,520. The price is down around 2% and it seems like it may struggle to move above the USD 3,600 and USD 3,650 resistance levels.
On the downside, the USD 3,520 level is a short term support, below which there is a risk of downside break below the USD 3,500 and USD 3,480 support levels in the near term. Ethereum price  made a sharp turn after the Constantinople hard fork was delayed. ETH/USD dipped below the USD 125 and USD 120 support levels. The pair tested the USD 115 support and later corrected a few points. 
The price is currently down around 6% and it is facing a lot of hurdles on the upside near the USD 122 and USD 125 levels. On the downside, the USD 115 level is a strong support followed by USD 112. Bitcoin cash price  failed to break the USD 135 resistance and declined below the USD 130 support. BCH/USD is currently trading near the USD 125 level, with support at USD 122 and USD 120. The main resistances are USD 130 and USD 135.
EOS  is still above the USD 2.25 and USD 2.30 support levels, but it is facing a lot of offers near the USD 2.45 and USD 2.50 levels. 
Ripple price  dipped below the USD 0.330 and USD 0.325 support levels to enter a bearish zone. XRP/USD tested the USD 0.315 support and recovered above USD 0.320. However, it must settle above USD 0.325 and USD 0.330 for a sustained upward move. Despite recent bearish moves in bitcoin and ethereum, a few small cap altcoins gained more than 8%, including AE, WAX, STRAT, POWR and ZIL. Out of these, AE gained more than 22% and WAX is up close to 21%. To sum up, the recent decline in bitcoin price below USD 3,600 shifted the market sentiment. To start a fresh bullish wave, the price must settle above USD 3,600 and USD 3,650. If not, there is a risk of more losses in BTC, ethereum, ripple and other altcoins lower in the near term.

" In December, the Bitcoin mining difficulty was forecasted to drop once again, but it actually beat the forecast and increased during both of the last adjustments. This means that the miners are coming back, creating a more competitive environment. However, some players in the mining industry still need to deal with certain challenges. It was previously estimated that the mining difficulty, the adjustment of which was set for end of December 2018, would drop by 8.22%. However, data from major Bitcoin mining pool BTC.com shows that the difficulty on December 31st actually increased by 10.03% at that time, and again two weeks later, at the next adjustment, by 4.72%. Now, the pool estimates that the difficulty will increase by another 4.35% in almost 13 days. 10 recent Bitcoin mining difficulty adjustments: The mining difficulty of Bitcoin is adjusted every two weeks (every 2016 blocks, to be precise) to maintain the normal 10-minute block time. This means that if there are many miners competing amongst themselves and propagating blocks in less than ten minutes, the difficulty of the next puzzle will be increased; if there are few miners and it takes them much longer to find a solution, the difficulty is decreased - both times just enough to keep block times at around 10 minutes. To further add to the proof that miners are turning their rigs back on, the hash rate is also growing: in the past month, it is up from some 36.5k TH/s to around 42k TH/s, an increase of around 13%.  Bitcoin hash rate: _____
Bitcoin price chart: Moreover, small miners are increasing their share in the Bitcoin network, which helps boost decentralization. Unknown miners closed December having solved 22% of the total blocks up from 6% at the start of the year, according to weekly cryptocurrency publication Diar. The Bitcoin network is currently even less likely to experience a 51% attack given the fact the BTC.com controlled pools have lost dominance over the network, instead spreading the mining power over smaller participants. However, Bitcoin mining is expensive business, and not just due to the cost of the hardware rigs required. The amount of electricity spent is often the cause for incredibly high bills - and that’s without governments additionally increasing the cost of electricity spent on mining operations. As of April 1st, power rates for cryptocurrency firms will go up by 15% in Washington. This is scheduled to go up by another 35% in 2020, and another 50% in 2021. Now, according to the Grant County public utility district (PUD), nine cryptocurrency firms have filed suit at the US District Court of Eastern Washington for imposing an “evolving industry” rate that targets mining operations. Things are getting increasingly difficult for some other mining industry companies as well. Meanwhile, Bitmain, the world’s largest mining hardware maker and operator of the two major Bitcoin mining pools, is seeing their share of trouble, too. The company has announced another round of layoffs, after they were rumored to have lost over USD 700 million in Q4 2018. They closed down their Israeli branch and fired all of its employees, which was followed by reports by Chinese media that Bitmain CEOs Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan are set to step down. The new cuts are happening in Amsterdam, Netherlands and Rockdale, Texas - both of which are losing all Bitmain operations located there. Moreover, US-based Bitcoin mining company Giga Watt is finally going out of business after declaring bankruptcy in November 2018, and the company’s token will become worthless, CCN reported. The firm lasted a little over a year, launching with an initial coin offering in September 2017. The reason for this are unpaid power bills, according to the report. As reported by Cryptonews.com, Giga Watt had filed for bankruptcy in Washington in November, still owing creditors nearly USD 7 million.",2019-01-15
" After testing the USD 3,450 level, bitcoin price recovered above USD 3,500 and formed a support base. Later, BTC/USD started an upside correction and traded above the USD 3,600 and USD 3,620 resistance levels. Similarly, ethereum price formed a solid support above USD 115 and bounced back above USD 120 and  USD 125. Ripple price also performed well and managed to settle above the USD 0.325 levels. These are early positive signs, but the market must recover further to overcome selling pressure. If not, there is a risk of bitcoin and altcoins moving back in a bearish zone. Total market capitalization  There was a decent upward move above the USD 3,500 and USD 3,600 resistances in bitcoin price . BTC/USD even traded above the USD 3,650 level, but it failed to hold gains and later started a short term downside correction. An initial support is near the USD 3,600 level, below which the price may retest the USD 3,550 level.
On the upside, the first hurdle for buyers is near the USD 3,680 level, above which the price must settle above USD 3,700 for an acceleration towards the USD 3,800 level. Ethereum price  gained more than 8% recently and moved above the USD 120 and USD 125 resistance levels. ETH/USD tested the USD 130 resistance and it is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) consolidating gains. 
Buyers need to push the price above USD 130 and USD 132 for more gains towards the USD 140 level. On the downside, the USD 125 level is an initial support, below which the price may drop back to USD 120. Bitcoin cash price  found support and recovered above the USD 125 and USD 130 levels. However, BCH/USD seems to be struggling above USD 130 and it could decline once again towards the USD 122 - USD 124 zone. On the flip side, a break above USD 130 - USD 132 could lead the price towards USD 140.
EOS  rallied above the USD 2.20 and USD 2.40 levels. It traded close to the USD 2.50 resistance and later corrected below USD 2.40. The key support is at USD 2.35 and USD 2.32.
Ripple price  gained traction above the USD 0.310 support and jumped above the USD 0.320 and USD 0.325 resistance levels. XRP/USD may continue higher if it surpasses the USD 0.330 resistance level. Many small cap altcoins gained bullish momentum and recovered more than 10%, including REP, QKC, LINK, REPO, STRAT, NPXS, MANA, WAX, MKR, THETA and DCN. Out of these, REP is up around 25% and QKC gained close to 25%. Overall, bitcoin price recovered nicely above USD 3,500 and USD 3,600, but it must extend gains above the USD 3,700 barrier to move into a bullish zone. If BTC/USD fails to hold gains above USD 3,500, it could drag ethereum, ripple and other altcoins lower in the near term.

" Bitcoin dropped by more than USD 100 on Sunday, moving below USD 3,550 before recovering to almost USD 3,600 on Monday morning. However, a new research findings suggest volatility might even increase. At the same time, Japanese regulators deny they’re considering approving crypto ETF.  According to the Boston-based crypto analytics provider Flipside Crypto, a large number of bitcoin holders who haven’t touched their coins for more than two and a half years are now starting to move. Speaking with Bloomberg, Flipside Crypto’s head of data science, Eric Stone, said the supply of “active bitcoins” in the market has increased by 40% since the summer of 2018. The trend has now moved so far that around 60% of the entire bitcoin supply is currently being held by wallets that have been active in the last 30 days. According to Stone, the same phenomena also occurred prior to the large price swings in the bitcoin market in 2015 and 2017. As is well-known, that price move brought bitcoin to an all-time high of nearly 20,000 USD in 2017.  He further added that “It’s definitely a big shift [...] There’s more potential than usual for price swings.” The question now is whether that will be up or down. As previously reported, a new triangle-shaped chart pattern may signal lower prices ahead.  Moreover, despite the recent sell-off, New York based research company Delphi Digital confirmed yesterday that their previous forecast that Bitcoin to bottom out in the first quarter of this year still stands.  Bitcoin price chart: Meanwhile, cryptocurrency researcher Willy Woo thinks that bitcoin is still looking for the bottom: To balance out my pessimism, here's a summary to the bull side by @renato_shira. Many of our on-chain indicators suggest the bottom may be near. While I don't concur with this conclusion, I like the analysis, it's a good summary of the bull case.https://t.co/Qp2A5OjebF In separate news, a spokesperson from Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) told News.bitcoin.com, that “there is no such fact that we are considering approving [Bitcoin] ETFs which track crypto-assets at present […] we are not currently considering approving them.” According to the spokesperson, the agency is of the opinion “that there is no need for trading crypto-assets derivatives at financial instruments exchanges where many market participants are able to trade.” The spokesperson was responding to a report by Bloomberg that the FSA is currently gauging industry interest in ETFs tracking digital currencies.",2019-01-14
" Bottom calling is one of the most sought-after practices during red markets, as everyone wants to know when the days might become brighter. Despite the recent sell-off, New York based research company Delphi Digital confirmed yesterday that their previous forecast that Bitcoin to bottom out in the first quarter of this year still stands. This time, the company published analysis of bitcoin holders to explain the process by which they concluded this. ""We’ve established that selling pressure from long term holders is significantly tapped, and accumulation has begun,"" the company said in the report.  The process uses UTXO age dynamics to figure out when long term holders will stop the selling pressure. UTXO stands for the unspent output from bitcoin transactions, while the UTXO age indicates the last time bitcoin was moved.   ""Bitcoin's aggregate UTXO age distribution over time provides insight into buying and selling patterns through previous market cycles, along with where we stand now, and what we can likely expect moving forward,"" the researchers explained. Separating HODLers who haven’t moved their funds in over a year from those who haven’t moved it in longer timeframes, they conclude that most of the selling pressure comes from 3 to 5 year hodlers with a caveat: “An important understanding that allows this to work is that a large portion of the coins in the 5 year+ band are lost.” 7/ Based on the points below, we can presume that most selling came from 3-5 Year holders. An important understanding that allows this to work is that a large portion of the coins in the 5 year+ band are lost. Please refer to the full report for an explanation of each assumption. pic.twitter.com/1IXmsJV9gw The company then explains, “Another important takeaway is we can assume these older owners have exhausted much of their selling efforts, evident in the flattening of these older UTXO bands, coupled with the 1 Year UTXO band reaching a floor and staying flat through the first half of 2018.” The graphs point to an accumulation process that is similar to what happened at the end of 2014, implying a bottom in sight.  They further add that there are strong correlations between the current situation and historical figures, especially the end of 2014 and the end of 2018: “With this data, we can estimate the date of these events. A uniformity across both cycles was the slope from the base of the 1 Year+ line to its peak [...] The date and UTXO floor holding rate, which will occur during the next selloff, are the remaining factors that are needed to complete the cycle. It's difficult to be confident in a forecast this far out, but our estimates have the next UTXO floor occurring in Q4 2022.” This new UTXO floor could be the foreshadowing of the next bottom, should the pattern stay consistent. The previous research, published by the company back in December, drew a parallel between 2013 and 2017, as the price’s rise of late 2017 mimics that of 2013, where peak valuations were followed by an extended bear market, characterized by multiple relief rallies on the way to drastically lower prices, but the bottom does not seem to be too far off. Meanwhile, an informal poll in the beginning of last autumn showed that usually very cautious Wall Street investors were calling a bottom in the bitcoin market. Twitter users, however, were more skeptical. As for the current state of the market, CEO of cryptocurrency company Circle, Jeremy Allaire, explained during a recent AMA (Ask Me Anything) session on Reddit: “My general perception is that the markets have been oversold and that some core assets have decoupled from their usage, which suggests they are undervalued. We look at things like hashrate health, on-chain activity, as key indicators of usage and adoption and underlying unit economic support."" As reported by Cryptonews.com, as discouraging as recent market events may be for anyone hoping that Bitcoin will 'go to the Moon,' there are other measures of the cryptocurrency's health, and these reveal that it's doing better than many people currently think.",2019-01-11
" Yesterday, we saw renewed selling pressure on bitcoin below the USD 3,925 and USD 3,900 support. BTC/USD extended losses and broke the USD 3,800, USD 3,700 and USD 3,640 support levels. Similarly, ethereum declined heavily below the USD 140 and USD 132 support levels. ETH/USD is currently (UTC 08:10 AM) trading near USD 125, with a bearish angle. Ripple price also fell sharply and traded below the USD 0.350 and USD 0.335 support levels. The current price action is pretty bearish and it seems like there could be more downsides in BTC and altcoins in the coming sessions. Total market capitalization  Sellers gained control below USD 3,800 and pushed bitcoin price  below the USD 3,700 and USD 3,640 support levels. BTC/USD traded close to the USD 3,540 support and it is currently consolidating losses. An initial resistance is at USD 3,600, above which the price may test the USD 3,640 resistance.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,540 - USD 3,550, below which the price is likely to visit the USD 3,500 support in the near term.  Ethereum price  tumbled and settled below the USD 132 support. ETH/USD even broke the USD 130 and USD 125 support before buyers appeared near the USD 120 - USD 121 zone.
If there is an upside correction, the previous supports at USD 130 and USD 132 are likely to act as hurdles. On the downside, the USD 120 - USD 121 zone is a crucial support, below which the price could decline towards the USD 106 support. Bitcoin cash price  declined heavily and it even broke the USD 140 and USD 132 support levels. BCH/USD is down around 8% and it may soon break the USD 127 support. The next main support is at USD 125, followed by USD 122. On the upside, resistances are aligned at USD 132 and USD 138.
EOS  trimmed most its gains and traded below the USD 2.60 and USD 2.50 support levels. The price is currently trading near USD 2.40 and it may decline towards the USD 2.25 support.
Ripple price  gained bearish momentum after it broke the USD 0.350 support. XRP/USD traded below the USD 0.340 and USD 0.330 supports to move further into a bearish zone. The next crucial supports are USD 0.320 and USD 0.312. Many small cap altcoins declined heavily and are down more than 8%, including R, TRX, AE, REPO, DCN, BCZERO, STRAT, WTC, WAN, ZIL and STEEM. Out of these, R is down around 15% and TRX fell close to 12%. Overall, bitcoin is back in a bearish zone below USD 3,750. If BTC/USD breaks the USD 3,500 support, sellers are likely to push the price towards USD 3,200. Besides, ethereum and ripple could also extend declines if they fail to stay above the USD 120 and USD 0.320 supports respectively. However, some of the top 50 coins in terms of market capitalization are still in positive territory for the week.

" The most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin may not be completely out of the woods yet, a popular technical analyst warns traders.  Although the sentiment surrounding bitcoin has been boosted by renewed hopes after a gain of almost 30% since the bottom in mid-December, a new triangle-shaped chart pattern may signal lower prices ahead, analyst Jesse Colombo at Clarity Financial, Houston-based registered investment advisor firm, wrote on Tuesday. According to Colombo, bitcoin has just formed another triangle pattern, following the previous big triangle pattern that ended with a breakout to the downside on November 14 last year. The way Colombo sees it, the new chart set-up should be seen as a continuation pattern in the currency bearish trend. The number one cryptocurrency “is likely to make another big move once a breakout occurs,” Colombo wrote in the update, while adding that “bitcoin is still in a confirmed downtrend and a breakdown from this pattern would likely foreshadow the cryptocurrency hitting the low thousands or even under USD 1,000, eventually.” The analyst, who claims correctly predicted the fall below the important USD 6,000 level in October, further wrote: “If bitcoin breaks down from the current triangle, the downtrend will continue as the digital currency further erases its gains made during the 2017 cryptocurrency bubble.” “For now, I am watching which way Bitcoin breaks out from the triangle that is currently forming,” he concluded. Meanwhile, Travis Kling, founder of the crypto hedge fund Ikigai, told Bloomberg that “it’s unlikely that the bottom is in for Bitcoin” as ""the preponderance of evidence leads us to believe that we’ll see more lows before we head higher."" Bloomberg also refers to GTI VERA Bands Indicator, a technical measure, which suggests that Bitcoin is on the brink of a large move. However, it's direction is not clear yet. Also, on Tuesday, DoubleLine Capital CEO Jeffrey Gundlach said that a move to USD 5,000 for bitcoin is possible, CNBC reported. However, he did not specify when it may happen.  “I don’t recommend anything with bitcoin, really… but if you really want to speculate, I think it could make it to USD 5,000. Talk about an easy 25%,” Gundlach was quoted as saying. As reported last week, data from a DailyFX research note showed that 80% of traders with a position in bitcoin are on the long side – meaning they have positioned themselves for higher prices. This is the highest level of optimism among bitcoin traders since November 2018. However, the danger is that these traders will be forced to sell if things do not turn out the way they expected. Today, bitcoin is down by more than 5% in the last 24 hours (UTC 07:26 AM.)  The recent bearish moves in BTC/USD below USD 3,850 are signaling an increase in selling pressure. If sellers remain in action and the price drops below USD 3,720, bitcoin and many altcoins could extend slides in the coming sessions.",2019-01-10
" Yesterday, there was a short term downside correction in bitcoin below the USD 3,950 support. Later, BTC/USD recovered and traded above the USD 3,950, USD 3,975 and USD 4,000 levels. However, buyers failed to gain traction and later the price started trading in a range above USD 3,950. Ethereum also recovered a few points and tested the USD 150 resistance, with a bullish angle. Ripple price is slowly grinding higher and it seems like the price may rise towards the USD 0.365 resistance. The current bias is slightly bullish and there are chances of more upsides in bitcoin price above USD 4,000. Total market capitalization  After recovering above the USD 4,000 level bitcoin price  corrected a few points. However, BTC/USD stayed above the USD 3,950 support and it is currently trading in a range. On the upside, an initial resistance is near USD 4,000, above which the price may climb towards the USD 4,050 and USD 4,100 resistance levels.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,950, which will most likely act as a pivot area. A close below USD 3,950 could spark bearish moves towards USD 3,925 and USD 3,880 in the near term. Ethereum price  recovered from the USD 145 support and traded above USD 148. ETH/USD is currently up close to 2% and it seems like it could break the USD 150 and USD 153 resistance levels.
The main resistance is at USD 155, above which the price may climb to USD 160. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 145, followed by USD 142 and USD 140. Bitcoin cash price  is trading flat near the USD 155 level. A proper break above USD 160 is needed for a decent upward move. If BCH/USD fails to gain traction, it could correct lower towards the USD 150 and USD 148 supports.
EOS  seems to facing a solid resistance near the USD 2.80 and USD 2.82 levels, above which the price may perhaps test the USD 3.00 resistance. The main supports are USD 2.72 and USD 2.68.
Ripple price  is slowly moving higher and it recently broke the USD 0.360 resistance. If XRP/USD breaks the USD 0.365 and USD 0.370 resistances, there could be more gains.  During the past few hours, many small cap altcoins gained more than 10%, including HOT, NPXS, LINK, NEO, VET, IOST, ZIL, CRO and AOA. Out of these, HOT rallied more than 24% and NPXS is up around 16%. Clearly, the price action is positive for bitcoin above the USD 3,925 and USD 3,950 support levels. Still, a successful close and follow through above USD 4,000 is must for BTC/USD buyers to gain momentum. Similarly, if ethereum gains strength above USD 155, ETH/USD may rally towards the USD 165 and USD 170 levels.

" A mural in Paris hides a reward in Bitcoin for the first person savvy enough to solve the visual puzzle, and the bounty is growing thanks to donations from the community. The prize, which started as BTC 0.26 earlier today, is now (UTC 01:19 PM) worth BTC 0.2849 (USD 1,142.)  The mural is a play on the iconic Eugène Delacroix work Liberty Leading the People and shows Lady Liberty leading a group of Gilets Jaunes protesters into confrontation as she holds the French flag in the air, and is the work of artist Pascal Boyart, who is often dubbed the French Banksy (a famous anonymous England-based street artist.) Hidden inside the mural is the private key to the prize, to which anyone can donate to increase the amount, but not everyone can participate: Boyart told his Twitter followers that they would need to physically be in Paris and actually in front of the mural in order to take part in the hunt. #StreetArt treasure hunt in Paris with a #Bitcoin puzzle For the 10th birthday of the genesis block, I painted this frescoe in Paris with a 0,26btc ($1000) puzzle in it. Here's the public key: 1NqPwPp7hEXZ3Atj77Ue11xAEMmXqAXwrQ  Thanks to @alistairmilne for sponsoring this 🙏 pic.twitter.com/F7aIkxmp6t The location, which had not been disclosed previously, has been discovered by Twitter user @TZTaughtMe, who claims to be the first person there, later joined by two journalists who were not participating in the treasure hunt. The hunt officially began around 12 hours ago, when Boyart both tweeted and posted his artwork to Reddit. In the comments to his official Reddit post, he revealed that people who cannot physically be there can still solve only a part of the puzzle from behind their computer screens.  One significant difference between the mural and the piece it was inspired by is the fact that Boyart decided to forego showing Lady Liberty’s breasts, instead painting a sort of bra over them. This led some in the community to speculate that this is where the puzzle’s solution could be hidden, accessible by removing part of the painting with acetone or similar chemicals. Still, many others hope that there will be no need to alter the panting to solve the puzzle. This is not the first puzzle to feature a reward in crypto. Several have already risen to prominence, and perhaps the best-known among them is The Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto, a visual puzzle associated with the Bitcoin address 1FLAMEN6 that was created in 2015 with 5 BTC locked in. It was finally solved three years later, having previously been dubbed “fiendishly difficult”, by a programmer who hadn’t even heard of it until a month before finally cracking it.",2019-01-07
" After giving up on their plans to allow listing of crypto-based derivatives and instruments like bitcoin futures on exchanges due to a viewpoint that these products are overly susceptible to speculation in December, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is now reportedly looking into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the digital assets. The FSA is currently gauging industry interest in ETFs tracking digital currencies, Bloomberg reported, citing ""a person familiar with the agency’s thinking."" It is estimated that such ETFs in Japan could revive appetite from retail investors. Japan’s ETF market is worth USD 335 billion (with about 75% owned by the central bank), compared with the USD 3.7 trillion worth of ETFs outstanding in the U.S., according to the report. So far, U.S. and European regulators have not approved ETFs, citing worries about price manipulation or the security of the underlying crypto assets. Securities lawyer and cryptocurrency commentator Jake Chervinsky estimates that the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) will never let a Bitcoin ETF happen. Commenting on the rumors that this instrument might soon go public, Chervinsky said that ""a proposed rule change is auto-approved if the SEC doesn’t make a decision by the deadline, but in reality, it would never happen."" Not going to happen.https://t.co/9TAtxZthDV As for ETFs themselves, some experts do not trust them either. Tyrone Ross, a Managing Partner of NobleBridge Wealth, an investment management and strategic wealth planning firm, said that he wasn’t a fan of Bitcoin ETF, and wouldn’t let his clients “go near it.” He is certain that cryptocurrencies inside of an ETF would only confuse people who don’t understand crypto or ETFs that well to begin with. And he is not alone. Andreas Antonopoulos, a Bitcoin evangelist and serial entrepreneur, also thinks ETFs are a terrible idea and that they “fundamentally violate the underlying principle of peer-to-peer money, where each user is operating not through a custodian but has direct control of their money, because they have direct control of their keys.” He warns that Bitcoin ETF might become an instrument to manipulate bitcoin prices. In the meantime, physically delivered bitcoin futures have been the buzzword in the crypto world lately, with Bakkt and Eris Exchange LLC expected to start offering such contracts early 2019. Moreover, CoinfloorEX (formerly a unit of the UK Bitcoin exchange Coinfloor, and now to be called Coin Futures and Lending Exchange - CoinFLEX), intends to offer the derivatives of some of the largest cryptocurrencies to Asian retail investors as early as February, Bloomberg reported on Monday.",2019-01-07
" The past few hours were very bullish for bitcoin and altcoins. BTC/USD gained bullish momentum and broke the USD 3,850 and USD 4,000 resistance levels. It is currently (UTC 08:00 AM) placed in an uptrend and it could continue to move higher towards the USD 4,150, USD 4,200 and USD 4,400 resistance levels. Ethereum settled above the USD 145 and USD 150 resistance levels. ETH/USD must clear the USD 160 - USD 162 barrier for an upside extension. Ripple price is gaining strength and it recently broke the USD 0.370 resistance. More importantly, litecoin rallied nearly 10% and broke the USD 35 and USD 38 resistances. The current market sentiment is positive and there could be more gains in bitcoin and altcoins. Total market capitalization  There was a solid upward move in bitcoin price  above the USD 3,800 and USD 3,850 resistance levels. BTC/USD even cleared the USD 4,000 weekly resistance to move further into a positive zone. In the short term, there could be a downside correction, but the price remains well supported near USD 3,850 and USD 3,650.
On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 4,050, above which the price may target the next weekly barrier near the USD 4,250 level. Above this last, the price may continue to move higher towards USD 4,400. Ethereum price  remained in an uptrend above the USD 140 support. ETH/USD broke the USD 150 resistance and it is currently trading in a range. 
The price must break the USD 160 - USD 162 weekly resistance to set the pace for more gains. The next hurdle for buyers is near the USD 175 level. On the downside, the main supports are USD 145 and USD 140. Bitcoin cash  gained traction and moved above the USD 160 resistance, but it seems to be struggling to clear the USD 165 and USD 170 resistance levels. BCH/USD may correct a few points, but dips remain supported near the USD 155 and USD 150 levels. Bitcoin SV is trading flat near the USD 88 - USD 90 zone. A break above the USD 90 resistance could clear the path for more gains in the near term.
Ripple price  gained more than 7% recently and it broke the USD 0.365 and USD 0.370 resistance levels. XRP/USD might continue to trade higher if buyers push the price above USD 0.375 and USD 0.380. During the past few sessions, many small cap altcoins gained more than 10%, including DEX, BCZERO, DGTX, HOT, BTC, WTC, NEO and DCN. Out of these, DEX rallied close to 100% and BCZERO is up around 26%. To sum up, bitcoin price is showing positive signs above the USD 3,850 pivot level. If BTC/USD accelerates above USD 4,050, the next stop could be USD 4,200 or even USD 4,400. Similarly, ethereum, ripple and litecoin are likely preparing for more upsides in the coming sessions.

" For every bounce up that follows a steep fall, bitcoin investors are seemingly returning to optimism. Data from a DailyFX research note shows that 80% of traders with a position in bitcoin are on the long side – meaning they have positioned themselves for higher prices. According to Marketwatch, this is the highest level of optimism among bitcoin traders since November 2018. According to research analyst Fan Xu at DailyFX, this gives a long-to-short ratio – the ratio between those who are betting on higher prices and those who are betting on lower prices – of 3.44 to 1. There are a few possible reasons for this, but most of all it appears to be a result of renewed optimism after bitcoin and other major coins have surged since mid-December. For ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform, the surge has been particularly strong with a gain of almost 90% since its low on December 14. Bitcoin, on its end, has recorded a gain of roughly 20% since its mid-December low. Bitcoin price chart: Assuming the trading data from DailyFX is correct, it would mean that the long side of the bitcoin trade is now getting quite “crowded,” with a very large number of traders expecting that prices will move higher.  The danger then, is that these traders will be forced to sell if things do not turn out the way they expected. This situation is often characterized as a “long squeeze,” as opposed to the typical “short squeezes” we have seen so many times in bitcoin this year. What is going to happen this time is of course impossible to tell with certainty, but according to DailyFX’s analyst, traders should be wary: “We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests bitcoin prices may continue to fall. Traders are further net-long than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger bitcoin-bearish contrarian trading bias,” she wrote.",2019-01-04
" Today is January 3rd, the tenth anniversary of the first block in the Bitcoin blockchain mined, also known as the Genesis block. Of course, the cryptoverse has taken to the internet to celebrate this day, from simply wishing Bitcoin a happy birthday, over going through all the events that brought Bitcoin to where it is today, to ideas on how to celebrate this birthday in a meaningful way.  If you’ve been reading up on the interesting tidbits about Bitcoin’s history, you may know that the genesis block of Bitcoin contains the text “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,” as this was the headline of The Times newspaper on that day. Now, ten years later, that very same newspaper is featuring Bitcoin on the bottom of its front page thanks to cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, where the writing says, “Thanks, Satoshi. We owe you one. Happy 10th birthday, Bitcoin.”  ____ Today's Times newspaper (3rd January 2019) celebrates Bitcoin's 10th BirthdayIncluded on the front page is the hash of the Bitcoin block 554,509. Thanks to @JihanWu  and @btccom_official for including the message ""ThanksSatoshi"" in the Coinbase inputhttps://t.co/HFskR9J6Jv pic.twitter.com/QtSRvI6wNo Included is the hash of the Bitcoin block 554,509, mined today, and co-founder of mining rig manufacturer Bitmain, Jihan Wu, and Bitcoin wallet and major mining pool BTC.com teamed up to have that block include the phrase “Thanks Satoshi” in honor of Bitcoin’s 10th birthday.  Also, it looks like the today's issue of The Times might become extremely popular: Picked myself up 10 copies. Potential to moon 10/10. If you're not lucky to buy one, you can read the article, published in the newspaper, online. And here you can find sellers of the original Bitcoin Genesis Block newspaper, but be ready to pay at least USD 50,000 per copy.   The phrase that Satoshi Nakamoto included on that day was not a purely spontaneous decision: a decade later, it proves that the genesis block was created on the same day the network was released, which means that Satoshi couldn’t have built up a secretly premined chain, undermining the network. However, YouTuber and crypto influencer Ivan on Tech adds another meaning to that phrase: “That's the reason Bitcoin exists. Bitcoin is the cure.” And Reddit user u/jam-hay reminds us that Bitcoin is stronger than ever ten years after its inception: “For years we have had to put up with condescending mainstream media, finance and political pundits sneering at the very thought that a group of volunteer developers could somehow create a free, open-source, decentralized and secure way for everyday people to store and send value to each other almost instantly.. all over the planet and beyond. 10 years on and we have over 2,000+ cryptocurrencies, 16,000+ markets and a combined market cap of $130bn [...] This new wave of Fintech spawned by Satoshi will do to the banking sector, what online shopping has done to brick and mortar shops.” There is also a countdown to the exact time when Bitcoin’s birthday falls: 18:15 GMT. Joining the celebration is Didi Taihuttu, best known as the man who sold almost everything he owned, poured it into bitcoin and moved his family into a trailer park. In his congratulations, he is joined by the rest of his family from their trailer. 🎉 Happy Birthday Bitcoin 🎉 Don't lose faith in #Bitcoin because of the price.

" Happy Genesis Block Day! Today is also the day when the Proof of Keys event is set to happen for the first time, dubbed the yearly HODLer initiation, when users withdraw their bitcoins from exchanges in order to prove ownership over them. The event is mostly being celebrated, as well as endorsed by many influencers in the community, but there are also those warning that it could all go very wrong. Among outspoken supporters of the Proof of Keys event are even people from cryptocurrency exchanges such as ShapeShift and Coinbase, while the CEO of the largest cryptocurrency exchange with fees Binance, Changpeng Zhao, says he has no opinion about the event: I don't have an opinion.  I know we are #safu.   We will provide what the market needs.  Feel free to do whatever you wish. Meanwhile, Balaji S. Srinivasan, Chief Technology Officer of Coinbase, tweeted instructions on how to send your crypto from Coinbase exchange to Coinbase (or other) wallet.  The point is not to send them back. But to hold your own keys so that you don’t have to trust exchanges. Which is the point of crypto. If you leave your crypto on exchanges you do not own them. Nice try though. Manufacturers of hardware wallets, which ensure that you own your private keys, also took a chance to remind about themselves: Tomorrow is the “Proof of Keys” day – this event entails sending your crypto assets to an address where you own the private keys. This initiative is in line with the popular phrase “Not your keys, not your Bitcoin”.Read more on it here: https://t.co/xlhJc7foVP#ProofOfKeys ShapeShift went a step further. In a blog post titled, “Why We Support #ProofofKeys and You Should, Too,” they went on to explain their opinion: “Bottom line: if you use an exchange versus a cold storage option, such as a hardware wallet, you’ll have to have complete third-party trust that the exchange is holding the funds that they say they are. When your cryptocurrencies are stored on a hardware wallet, you’re in complete control of your crypto.” Another institution supporting the event is Weiss Ratings, a veteran firm dedicated to analyzing investments. “‘Proof of Keys’ that is due tomorrow, will force exchanges to prove they actually have reserves of crypto they claim they own. #Crypto was designed to remove all intermediaries between people and their money, so we stand behind this initiative,” the company tweeted yesterday.  Former Wall Street veterans are also throwing their support behind the initiative. Caitlin Long, who spent 22 years at Wall Street and is now a self-proclaimed blockchain and Bitcoin enthusiast, urged her followers to participate: “Tomorrow is #ProofOfKeys-Jan 3 on 10th anniv of #Bitcoin’s genesis block. If someone else has your private keys do you know if your #BTC is really there? No. Declare your monetary sovereignty by holding your private keys.” And when that FOMO (fear of missing out) truly kicks in, you can’t just let the event pass you by as if you’re not even part of the space.  I didn't have any #bitcoin kept on an exchange, but I bought some and withdrew it anyways to participate in #ProofOfKeys @TraceMayer @coinbase pic.twitter.com/xLY4TPV8NT And if you’d like everyone on the streets to know you’re supporting it, you can buy a cap, or a t-shirt sporting a design related to the event. However, we do not advise wearing an unbuttoned jacket to show off the t-shirt if you’re from the northern hemisphere, as we’re currently in the middle of winter here. Happy #SatoshiRun #ProofOfKeys #BeYourOwnBank, if you don’t control it, it ain’t yours.What a time to be alive :) pic.twitter.com/hSSUJL491T Of course, not everything is just fun and games: some people warn about possible scams and phishing attacks on this day as well. “Tomorrow a lot of scammers will be operating to steal your Bitcoin and take advantage of “proof of keys”. Expect phishing attacks, fake guides on how to get your coins off exchanges, creative scam Twitter/Google ad campaigns targeting the term “proof of keys”, etc. BE VIGILANT!” warns Twitter user @CobraBitcoin, co-owner of bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org. Twitter user @CanMind goes a step further with potential conspiracy theories: “This proof of keys has a potential to be a market manipulation strategy... Users pull cryptocurrencies from exchanges while the [whales] remain inside and play with the prices as they wish! Users try to come back but of course the gains have been made!!” he warned. Whether or not the event will influence the price remains to be seen, but many are already speculating about what could happen. “Most people are expecting the price to rise (even rise dramatically). This won't happen. The price of an asset almost always has the expectations of the masses already built into it, so the people who think that BTC's price will skyrocket tomorrow have already bought in so they won't be buying any more. [...] If the price starts to do a belly dive it will be immediately picked up by all the individuals that were hoping for a dive in order to get some cheap coins so it will be instantly pushed back up,” writes Reddit user u/taranasus. Others are looking at the bright side of the event. “#Proofofkeys allowed me to consolidate my bitcoin holdings. I found I had bitcoin in an exchange that I didn't use for 1 year. Thank you @TraceMayer for this great idea! Happy birthday bitcoin!” writes Twitter user @Godineau.  And of course, we would be very worried if a hyped event happened without jokes to follow it through. “I hope this doesn’t need to be said, but #ProofOfKeys does not mean to post screenshots of your private keys online,” writes @TheBitcoinSOV. And the possible reaction of insolvent exchanges was perfectly captured by @_dnov. Insolvent exchanges when #ProofOfKeys was announced pic.twitter.com/ippHlAG9Kb Also, it looks like the event has it's own song: Remember to keep your 🔑 safe. $btcTbh I made a whole rap about taking your crypto off Coinbase #ProofOfKeys 🌚Full video here: https://t.co/Tszjgs3pS9 pic.twitter.com/9C13RIXe9g While Trace Mayer just reminded why you needs to control your own private keys to your coins: Would you rather have: #ProofOfKeys or #ProofOfRoger? #MtGox✌️@TuurDemeester @SatoshiLite @Excellion @lopp @nvk @CaitlinLong_ @pierre_rochard @bitstein @giacomozucco @adam3us @ToneVays @maxkeiser @theonevortex @jimmysong @aantonop @bensemchee @RoadtoRoota @peterktodd @starkness pic.twitter.com/Q3zQorgTvs",2019-01-03
" Yesterday, we discussed a possible upward move above the USD 3,800 resistance in bitcoin price. BTC/USD broke the USD 3,800 and USD 3,820 resistance levels, opening the doors for more gains. However, a successful close above the USD 4,000 barrier is needed for buyers to gain momentum. According to Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, a major bottom is near in bitcoin since there is a solid rise in adoption and people are getting more and more involved in the market, Bloomberg reported. Besides, the GTI Vera Convergence Divergence indicator is pointing a sharp increase in buying interest, it added. Therefore, if buyers succeed in clearing the USD 4,000 and USD 4,200 resistance levels, there could be more gains in the near term.

Bitcoin cash price  gained more than 3% and broke the USD 165 resistance levels. BCH/USD may continue to move higher towards the USD 170 and USD 175 resistance levels. On the downside, supports are visible near the USD 160 and USD 158 levels. Bitcoin SV is trading flat near the USD 90 level. If there is a break above the USD 92 and USD 95 resistance, the price may test the USD 100 level.
Ripple price  moved above the USD 0.360 resistance and it may continue to rise towards the USD 0.365 and USD 0.370 resistances. The key support is at USD 0.360, below which the price may test USD 0.355. During the past few sessions, a few small cap altcoins traded up more than 8%, including LINK, REP, DCN, ICX, DGD, XIN and EOS. Out of these, LINK gained more than 20% and REP is up around 16%. To sum up, bitcoin price is slowly gaining momentum above the USD 3,800. If BTC/USD clears the USD 3,900 resistance, buyers may push the price above USD 4,000. The main driving force is ethereum, dragging bitcoin and other altcoins to the upside. If the current market sentiment stays intact, there could be more gains in bitcoin and altcoins.

" A hacker, or a group of them, has been targeting popular Electrum wallets for Bitcoin since December 21st, and has possibly stolen 243.59 BTC (USD 912,000.) The attack resulted in Electrum wallet apps showing a message on users' computers, urging them to download a malicious wallet update from an unauthorized GitHub (a software development platform) repository. There is an ongoing phishing attack against Electrum users. Our official website is https://t.co/aHiZIZH54e Do not download Electrum from any other source. More on the attack here: https://t.co/x5mPVspKfO The attack has stopped today, at least temporarily, after GitHub admins took down the hacker's GitHub repository. However, admins of the Electrum wallet expect a new attack to soon get underway, with either a new GitHub repo or a link to another download location altogether, according to Zdnet.  This attack was made possible by a vulnerability in the wallet itself, which lets Electrum servers trigger popups with custom text inside users' wallets. This means that the attackers were able to tell users to download their malicious software, which in turn prompted them to enter a two-factor authentication code (2FA), used to later steal the funds: One the victims of the theft took to Reddit to write about their ordeal:  ""I have used electrum a lot, here is how this went down tonight. I log onto my electrum where I have about 1.4xx btc that I was trying to send. When i attempt to send I get a strange message that says ""in order to send please update to the latest version here: https://github.com/electrum-project/electrum"" now this link was weird for two reasons, first off it is not the official link from the electrum site and second it didn't allow me to click it like normal links do/would. I had to copy/paste it into my browser window. I did that and proceeded to download the application here, when I logged on it immediately asked me for my 2 factor code which I thought was a little strange as well as Electrum usually only asks for that when you attempt to send. I kept trying to send and kept getting an error code ""max fee exceeded no more than 50 sat/B"" I then restored my wallet on a separate pc and found that my balance had been transferred out in full to this address: https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/14MVEf1X4Qmrpxx6oASqzYzJQZUwwG7Fb5.""  However, from this address, more than 200 BTC have been sent to an address that holds 243.59 BTC as of the time of writing. After receiving news of attacks, the Electrum team responded by ""silently updating"" the Electrum wallet app, so these messages - like the one urging the download of the malicious code - don't render as rich HTML text anymore, according to SomberNight, a developer at the Electrum wallet team. The developer wrote on GitHub that Electrum developers have currently identified at least 33 malicious Electrum servers that have been added to their network, but the number appears to be around 40-50. Protecting yourself from such attacks can be difficult, but in this particular case, a single red flag can be distinguished: the app asked for a 2FA code at wallet startup, whereas 2FA is usually only needed before a transaction. This is similar to a service asking you for your credit card details when you’re doing anything but paying - they have no reason to need that data at the time. Stay vigilant!",2018-12-27
" A bet made late last year by chief information officer and co-founder of cryptocurrency hedge fund BlockTower Ari Paul on behalf of the company seems, beyond all reasonable doubt, to be lost. The bet specified that a single bitcoin would be worth at least USD 50,000 by the end of 2018, and there is USD 1 million at stake. The bet would have given the manager the chance to buy 275 bitcoins at USD 50,000 apiece any time before this Friday, when the call options expire, a purchase that would have cost USD 13.8 million. The manager spent just under USD 1 million on those call options. Bitcoin is trading at around USD 3,800 as of the time of writing, a drop of more than 80% from its peak of USD 19,783, when BlockTower made its bet. Back in 2017, in an interview with CNBC, Paul explained that the option contracts BlockTower has purchased expire if the price of Bitcoin fails to reach the prophesied price by the end of 2018. But if it does, it pays out the firm on a 30 to 1 odds. Hence, this USD 1 million bet would generate BlockTower a USD 29 million in profit. At the time, he added, “Bitcoin is volatile. This is a hyper volatile asset. Bitcoin is up more than 1,400% this year. It also falls 30% almost every other month. These calls are a bet that if its volatile to the upside we can easily see over USD 50,000 next year.” ___",2018-12-27
" Recently, we saw a downside move below the USD 4,100 and USD 3,850 supports in bitcoin price. BTC/USD tested the USD 3,600 - USD 3,620 support area and later started trading in a range. The price is currently consolidating and likely preparing for the next break either above USD 3,850 or below USD 3,620. Similarly, ethereum price declined and tested the USD 125 support, which is acting as a crucial hurdle for sellers. Ripple price is following a declining path and it has trimmed most of its gains from the USD 0.450 resistance. It seems like the market is basing for the next move in the coming sessions.  Total market capitalization  During the past few hours (UTC 06:30 AM), bitcoin price  mostly traded in a range above the USD 3,620 support. BTC/USD could start a decent upward move if there is a proper break above the USD 3,800 and USD 3,850 resistance levels. Above this last, the price will most likely climb above the USD 3,900 and USD 3,950 resistance levels.
On the downside, the main support is near the USD 3,620 level, below which the price may well decline sharply below the USD 3,600 level. If there are more losses, the price could decline towards the USD 3,450 and USD 3,320 support levels. Ethereum price  struggled to move past the USD 130 - USD 135 resistance zone. ETH/USD must settle above USD 135 (hourly close) to initiate a fresh upward move towards the USD 140 and USD 145 resistance levels.
On the flip side, if there is a downside break below the USD 125 support, there is a risk of more losses below the USD 120 support. The next major support awaits at USD 112 where buyers are likely to emerge. Bitcoin cash price  failed to clear the USD 180 and USD 185 resistance levels. BCH/USD declined more than 5% and tested the USD 165 support area. If there is a downside break below USD 160, there could be a test of USD 150. Bitcoin SV is slowly moving higher, but there is a strong resistance near the USD 94, USD 96 and USD 98 levels. 
Ripple price  moved below the USD 0.380 support, which is a bearish sign. XRP/USD must trade above USD 0.375 and USD 0.382 to start a decent recovery in the near term. Recently, there was an increase in selling pressure on small cap altcoins, resulting in declines in DEX, POLY, STRAT, ONT, PIVX, MGO and IOST. Out of these, DEX declined more than 20% and POLY was down around 12%. To sum up, bitcoin price is reaching crucial juncture near the USD 3,620 level. If BTC/USD fails to move past the USD 3,850 resistance, there could be a sharp decline towards the USD 3,320 level in the near term. Likewise, ethereum price must trade above USD 135 to avoid further declines in the near term.

" One big purpose of Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency was decentralization: not just for the sake of security and removing a single central point of failure, but first and foremost to seize the power over your own funds from centralized entities. That’s what a community called “HODLers of Last Resort” does the upcoming January 3rd: participate in a Proof of Keys celebration by demanding and taking possession of all bitcoins held by trusted third parties on their behalf.  This practice, considered a test of trust by the community, is said to prove possession and strengthen network consensus.  “You can consider Proof of Keys a combat readiness drill. Hopefully, it will help prevent further annoying skirmishes with those who despise individuals empowered with monetary sovereignty,” the official website explains.  The movement is a chance for users to reassert possession over their own holdings, as well as to force third parties to prove that they actually hold all the assets they claim. According to Trace Mayer, host of the Bitcoin knowledge podcast and one of the main advocates for Proof of Keys, the event is designed to be a “celebration.” “The idea of Proof of Keys is to show to the [crypto] community that there is still control of our funds,” Mayer said in a video announcement. “Lots of new people have come into the community… I think it’s important for us to declare and redeclare our monetary sovereignty on a regular basis”. Private keys are, in short, a secret string of letters and numbers used to authorize transactions, signifying actual ownership of digital assets. Despite this, many crypto owners aren’t actually in possession of their private keys, relying instead on third-party entities like exchanges or custodial services to safeguard their holdings. This may seem like a non-issue - after all, banks work the same way - but the ideals behind Bitcoin, as well as legitimate safety concerns, warrant a check up at least out of principle.  The movement has garnered a lot of support. Over the past few weeks, many prominent figures in the crypto community, such as cryptography expert Nick Szabo, have added [Jan/3 [key emoji]] to their Twitter handles to show support for the operation. The mantra behind it - “Not your keys; not your bitcoin” - was initially coined by Andreas Antonopoulos, famous Bitcoin evangelist. The choice of date is no coincidence either: on January 3rd, 2009, Bitcoin’s Genesis block (first block of the blockchain) went live. The concept for the event originated from Reddit user “sotashi,” whom Mayer credited on his new website. Mayer has invited anyone interested in participating in the Proof of Keys event to tweet or retweet his message and fill out a form on the Proof of Keys website with links to their tweets. As of the time of writing, 246 people have filled out the form, including crypto personalities such as Keiser Report co-host Stacy Herbert and Adamant Capital founder Tuur Demeester. However, not everyone is supporting the initiative: ""do banks support people emptying their bank account""?? by withdrawing your coins from exchanges you're taking away their liquidity and power to manipulate the market. never store your coins on any exchange be your own bank with a hardware wallet like @LedgerHQ ,@Trezor etc. This event will also be “The ultimate stress test,” Mayer added, given that the movement of participants’ coins would result in a large number of transactions on that day. Noting that “Companies and exchanges must prove their trustworthiness and consensus,” he adds: “This simple exercise costs little, perhaps a few transaction fees, yet proves possession and strengthens network consensus [...] Then on the 4th of January there can be a return to business as usual with renewed confidence based on Proof of Keys.” Reddit user u/Porriz explains the significance of this: “Crypto is meant to be owned by yourself, safeguarded by yourself, stored by yourself. Every time you ‘buy’ coins in exchange and leave it there, you really don’t own any of those. Best services are services that lets you buy to any btc address you provide, eg. straight to your hardware wallet. The point is, that you do not have the coins unless you have private keys to yourself. You can achieve this by installing a software wallet on your phone/computer, generating paper wallet or buying a hardware wallet and moving the funds to those wallets. That is the only way to ensure you have the coins if eg. exchanges goes bankrupt, scams happen in exchanges, or anything similar happens.” u/FixedGearJunkie adds, “Really you're pulling it from the bank's pocket and putting it in your pocket. Theoretically it should have zero impact on the market as those coins have already been ‘bought.’ But if literally everyone that owned Bitcoin which was still on an exchange participates the outcome may be interesting and beneficial to the ecosystem.”",2018-12-26
" It seems that Wall Street is in limbo regarding its cryptocurrency plans, even when some crypto scene players are calling the bottom. However, this silence of the institutional players might be illusory.  Joseph Lubin, co-founder of the Ethereum platform and founder of blockchain software technology company ConsenSys, recently tweeted: I am calling the cryptobottom of 2018. This bottom is marked by an epic amount of fear, uncertainty, and doubt from our friends in the 4th and crypto-5th estates. In a series of tweets, he goes on to explain that the recent news of ConsenSys 2.0 cutting its staff brought on an “epic amount of conjecture and preemptive paranoia,” but that the company is still going strong. In conclusion, he adds, “Peaking [sic] into 2019, if you could see the landscape through my eyes, you'd have to wear shades.” Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the CEO of largest cryptocurrency exchange by 24 hour trading volume with fees, Binance, was also equally optimistic in a recent interview: “I think that people in the industry are still very confident about the future.” The crypto community may be optimistic, but the traditionalists seem wary. According to people familiar with the matter, banking giant Goldman Sachs has made little to none progress in their crypto projects, having signed up only 20 clients, Bloomberg reported. Daniel H. Gallancy, chief executive officer of New York-based SolidX Partners, a company looking to launch Bitcoin ETFs in the US, told the news outlet: “The market had unrealistic expectations that Goldman or any of its peers could suddenly start a Bitcoin trading business. That was top-of-the-market-hype thinking.” Also, other undisclosed sources familiar with the matter, state that yet another giant, Morgan Stanley, has been technically prepared to offer swaps tracking Bitcoin futures since at least September, yet thus far has not traded a single contract. There had also been rumors about British bank Barclays exploring the possibilities of crypto integration, but a spokesman told Bloomberg that the bank currently has no plans for a crypto trading desk.  However, crypto pros see signs institutions are getting ready to jump back in if they need to. “The more important story is all the infrastructure that’s being built now to enable institutional trading,” Ben Sebley, a former Credit Suisse Group AG trader who is now head of brokerage at crypto boutique NKB Group, told Bloomberg. While Eugene Ng, a former Deutsche Bank AG trader in Singapore who has set up crypto hedge fund Circuit Capital, added that ""It appears as if progress is coming to a halt, yet nothing could be further from the truth."" ""The bear market is going to allow many of these institutions to build the proper foundations without rushing to build-out infrastructure without adequate testing for fear of missing out on a gold rush,"" Ng said. Moreover, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, is likely to launch its Bitcoin futures trading and custody platform Bakkt in January, despite a possible delay by a few days. Bakkt has long been regarded as a big step of traditional investors into crypto that could boost the adoption of Bitcoin.

" This past week, bitcoin price climbed above the USD 3,500 and USD 3,800 resistance levels. It opened the doors for more gains and BTC/USD broke the USD 4,000 hurdle. The current price structure is positive above USD 4,000 and it seems like the price is preparing for more upsides above the USD 4,600 and USD 4,800 levels. Ethereum performed well recently and broke the USD 120 and USD 140 resistance levels. Similarly, ripple broke the USD 0.400 resistance and rallied above the USD 0.415 barrier. Going forward, there could be more gains as long as bitcoin is trading above USD 3,720. Total market capitalization  There was a sharp upward move above the USD 4,000 resistance in bitcoin price . BTC/USD is up nearly 5%, with an immediate resistance at USD 4,250. If BTC/USD breaks the USD 4,250 resistance, it could test the next key resistance at USD 4,600. The main weekly resistance for the current wave is near the USD 5,000 handle.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 4,000, below which the weekly support is at USD 3,750. If there is a daily close below USD 3,750, the price may decline towards the USD 3,400 or USD 3,320 levels. Ethereum price  gained a lot of bullish momentum and broke the USD 124, USD 128 and USD 132 resistance levels. ETH/USD is up more than 15% and it tested the USD 150 resistance.
The price is currently correcting lower towards the first support at USD 142. If there are more losses, the price could test the USD 132 support. The main weekly support is at USD 125 and the key weekly resistance for buyers is at USD 150 followed by USD 155. Bitcoin cash  is trading nicely above the USD 200 support. BCH/USD is up around 7% to USD 205 and it could trade further above the USD 210 and 215 resistance levels. Bitcoin SV is also trading with a bullish bias above the USD 100 - USD 105 support. BCHSV needs to break the USD 112 - USD 115 resistance to climb towards USD 125.
Ripple price  finally broke the USD 0.400 - USD 0.402 resistance area. XRP/USD climbed more than 15% and it even broke the USD 0.415 resistance. The next key resistance is at USD 0.420 and support awaits at USD 0.410. Recently, many small cap altcoins traded higher and posted more than 15% gains, including PIVX, QTUM, LKY, DEX, NEO, REP, NEXO, XTZ, FCT and ZIL. Out of these, PIVX rallied more than 40% to USD 0.95 and QTUM is up around 22% to USD 2.95. To sum up, there are a lot of positive signs on charts of bitcoin, indicating more gains above USD 4,250. BTC/USD could extend the current bullish wave towards the USD 4,600 or USD 5,000 level. Likewise, altcoins like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, neo, icon, qtum, tron and cardano may extend gains in the coming days.

" American singer Mariah Carey may have to revise her Christmas hit very soon, as various survey show that many prefer to get cryptocurrencies as a present.  For example, for the first time, teenagers said they wanted cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and Fortnite “V-Bucks” virtual currency instead of cash, gift cards and gas money, according to the “Holiday 2018” consumer report released in November by investment bank and asset management firm Piper Jaffray. The popularity of cryptocurrencies on the internet, from social media to online games, is drawing people to the nascent industry. From a way towards financial independence and autonomy to a lesson in investing, cryptocurrencies as a gift are attracting many fresh faces. Especially, when the young generation spends more time in front of computers and lives an increasingly digital life. In different online games, more and more so-called virtual currencies are used to buy and sell items in the game. For many, in-game currencies like V-Bucks, from the wildly popular, online third-person shooter game Fortnite that is used to purchase outfits, “skins” and “Battle Passes” but holds no value outside of the game, are the first contact they have with virtual currencies. In some respects, cryptocurrencies are similar to the virtual money you find in a video game. You buy them with fiat currency, they have no tangible form, and you can use them to buy the goods and services you desire. Another indication of this trend are Twitter polls. Although Twitter’s algorithm does not let people see who voted for what, thus preventing any insight into potential trends such as the age of respondents, their area of origin etc., it can be reasonably assumed that most voters are relatively young, as they tend to be more tech-savvy than their elders - thus more likely to use Twitter in the first place.  Two of these come from the Bank of England and former Texas Congressman Ron Paul and show that digital currencies are vastly preferred to other options.  The Bank of England does not specify what “digital currencies” they mean in their question “If you receive money as a gift at Christmas, what’s your favourite way to get it?” but this option took 71% of the votes, whereas 20% of respondents voted for cash, 7% for bank transfer, and only 2% for gift vouchers. ___ A Twitter user reacted:  You just can't say #bitcoin .. can you?Let me help.B - I - T - C - O - I - NB - I - T - C - O - I - NB - I - T - C - O - I - NB - I - T - C - O - I - NB - I - T - C - O - I - NB - I - T - C - O - I - NB - I - T - C - O - I - NB - I - T - C - O - I - N Ron Paul, meanwhile, does not beat around the bush with his wording: the question is, “A wealthy person gifts you USD 10,000. You get to choose in which form you’ll accept the gift. But there’s a catch: You must keep the gift in the form that you choose for 10 years without touching it. In which form would you accept the gift?” The options are Bitcoin (50% of votes), gold (37%), US 10-year Treasury Bonds (11%) and Federal Reserve Notes (2%). ____ If you’re still wondering what to buy your friends for Christmas, check out our list of ideas. No matter what your budget is, you’re bound to find something to save you so close to the 25th, especially if you’re not that close to the person anyway. If you are - you should really consider buying gifts earlier. Merry Christmas and happy holidays!",2018-12-23
" It seems that, famous Bitcoin bull and head of Fundstrat Global Advisors, Tom Lee, has given up forecasting Bitcoin price.  In a note to clients, dated December 13th, Lee wrote, “We are tired of people asking us about target prices [...] Because of the inherent volatility in crypto, we will cease to provide any timeframes for the realization of fair value,” Bloomberg reported. His decision to opt out of the forecast game may not come as a surprise, as his predictions were notable for being highly optimistic, as well as falling very far off the mark this year. He started out by saying that Bitcoin could climb back to USD 20,000 by mid-year and even reach USD 25,000 by the end of December. He later amended this end-of-the-year forecast, pulling it down to a USD 22,000 - USD 20,000 range. Then in November, when Bitcoin was trading at around USD 5,500, Lee was certain the price would triple in the remaining month and a half. As it is now, we are ten days out from 2019, and the price is stubbornly refusing to follow these forecasts, currently trading at around USD 4,000 - still more than what we have seen throughout most of December. Lee wasn’t discouraged then either, instead saying that the market is wrong and that Bitcoin’s true value lies between USD 13,800 and USD 14,800, given the number of active wallet addresses, usage per account and factors influencing supply. This was yet another of his statements that was met with ridicule, and would prove to be the last prediction he gave before quitting the issue altogether. Bitcoin price chart: Tom Lee is hardly the only one whose predictions fell short. Many were hoping for an end of the year bull run similar to what happened in December 2017, when many cryptocurrencies reached their all-time highs, and Bitcoin itself climbed to almost USD 20,000. To the contrary, 2018 has disappointed many, but the internet does not forget and so many of the forecasts by other notable names in the industry still stand. For example, in May, Arthur Hayes of BitMEX estimated that Bitcoin will be worth USD 50,000 by 2018 year end, however, in November he was already talking about a USD 2,000 - USD 3,000 range. In November 2017, Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital forecasted that Bitcoin might reach USD 40,000 in 2018. In November this year he estimated that the price will stand in a USD 3,000 - USD 6,000 range ""until institutional investors step in."" Meanwhile, software tycoon John McAfee still stands by his prediction that Bitcoin will reach USD 1 million by the end of 2020, which is best known by the fact that McAfee promised to eat his own genitalia on national TV if that should not happen. Other, less attention-grabbing predictions include investor Tim Draper, who was “told by spirits” that Bitcoin would reach USD 250,000 by 2022; Anthony Pompliano, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, a digital asset management firm, who saw BTC rising to USD 50,000 by the end of this year; and Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of digital-asset investment firm BKCM LLC, who agrees with Draper on the USD 250k by 2022 forecast.",2018-12-21
" Yesterday, we saw a solid bullish wave above USD 3,700 in bitcoin and discussed the chances of more gains. BTC/USD did gain bullish momentum and broke the USD 3,900 and USD 3,950 resistance levels. Buyers were even successful in breaking the USD 4,000 barrier. Similarly, ethereum and ripple extended upsides and traded above the USD 110 and USD 0.375 resistance respectively. The best performers were bitcoin cash and bitcoin SV since both gained more than 40%. The market sentiment is clearly positive (UTC 08:20 AM) and it seems like bitcoin buyers outclassed sellers. Total market capitalization  After a minor downside correction, bitcoin price  started a fresh upward move. BTC/USD broke the USD 3,900 and USD 3,950 resistance levels and later surpassed the USD 4,000 hurdle. The price is currently up more than 5% and it is facing resistance near the USD 4,100 level.
If there is a break above the USD 4,100 and USD 4,200 levels, the price is likely to accelerate towards the USD 4,550 resistance. On the downside, an immediate support is at USD 3,950, below which the price may test the USD 3,820 level. Ethereum price  rallied above the USD 110 resistance. ETH/USD tested the USD 118 level and later corrected lower.
However, declines were limited and the price bounced back above USD 112. It is currently up more than 10% and it seems like buyers could make an attempt to clear the USD 118 and USD 120 resistance levels. The key support are USD 110 and USD 108. Bitcoin cash price  remained the best performing cryptocurrency among the top 10. BCH/USD rallied more than 50% and broke the USD 200 and USD 210 resistance levels. The next stop for buyers could be USD 225 followed by USD 235. Bitcoin SV also gained traction and climbed above the USD 110 and USD 120 resistance levels. It is currently trading near USD 128 with a bullish angle.
Ripple price  did not gain much and trimmed around 2% gains. XRP/USD retreated from the USD 0.380 resistance and it is currently trading near the USD 0.360 support. A break above USD 0.370 and USD 0.380 is needed for a solid upward move. The past few sessions were very bullish and many small cap altcoins gained more than 15%, including CRO, BCD, BTG, AION, DASH, ADA, MIOTA, AE, PIVX and TRX. Out of these, CRO rallied more than 30% and bitcoin diamond is up around 26%. Overall, bitcoin is trading nicely above the USD 3,900 and USD 3,800 support levels. Therefore, there are high possibilities of more gains above the USD 4,080 and USD 4,100 levels in the near term. If BTC/USD continues to gain bullish momentum, altcoins such as ethereum, bitcoin cash, bitcoin SV, ripple, litecoin, neo and others are also likely to climb further higher.

" Two members of the United States Congress have made a bid to change securities legislation dating back to the early 1930s, reclassifying cryptocurrencies and potentially making room for the introduction of cryptocurrency market regulations. The bipartisan bill is named the Token Taxonomy Act, and was put forward by Republican congressman Warren Davidson and Darren Soto of the Democrats. The draft law proposes making key changes to the Securities Act (1933) and the Securities Exchange Act (1934). It would specifically exclude cryptocurrencies, instead creating a clear legal definition of “digital tokens,” which would be excluded from the two acts, and thus would no longer automatically be regarded as securities. Today is the last day of Congress’ current session, meaning there is little real chance that the bill will be passed before the year is out. However, the draft law’s authors appear keen to table it again once Congress reconvenes in 2019. A number of America’s most prominent blockchain and cryptocurrency businesspeople have been calling for legal clarification. Davidson is a known blockchain proponent, and chaired a meeting of around 50 major financial and cryptocurrency-related companies in September this year. The regulatory Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) currently makes use of the “Howey Test,” an evaluation assessment created by the Supreme Court back in 1946. The test allows courts to determine whether certain transactions should qualify as ""investment contracts.” Courts have been using this test to assess whether cryptocurrencies can be considered as securities – despite complaints from critics, who call the test an ineffective way to assess digital, blockchain-powered tokens. CNBC quotes Kristin Smith, the head of the Blockchain Association, the “first Washington blockchain lobby group,” as saying, “Decentralized networks don’t fit neatly within the existing regulatory structure. [The bill] is a step forward in finding the right way to regulate them. It shows that there’s momentum on both sides. There's interest among bipartisan members.” Smith is also quoted as saying that the bill “lays groundwork for the next Congress"" – which will open with a Democrat majority next year. Smith also states that, if the bill receives Congress’ approval, cryptocurrencies will “likely fall under the purview of the Federal Trade Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC),” rather than remain under the control of the SEC. The SEC has previously stated that it considers all initial coin offerings (ICOs) as securities, with the specific exceptions of Bitcoin and Ethereum, both of which are considered “commodities,” and are now regulated by the CFTC. As reported by Cryptonews.com, governments will likely focus on two cryptocurrency-related regulation areas in 2019: taxation and regulation surrounding offerings/marketing to the public. Having seen that cryptocurrencies are becoming more safely policed, the general public may become more willing to use and adopt them.",2018-12-21
" The market seems to be getting better as original cryptocurrency Bitcoin climbs above USD 4,000 for the first time since the beginning of December. With a price increase of more than 8% in the past 24 hours as of the time of writing (UTC 10:20 AM), many in the crypto community breathe a sigh of relief. Bitcoin price chart: It may be too early to celebrate, however.  “The market is extremely oversold by most metrics - near the most oversold in Bitcoin’s history,” Mike McGlone, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst in New York said on Wednesday. According to McGlone, Bitcoin will form a new floor in 2019, which will be even lower than current prices in spite of the coin’s relative-strength index and its “extreme discount” to most moving averages. In either case, the fundamentals of Bitcoin and Ethereum networks have not fallen as much as prices have, author of the popular book Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond, Chris Burniske, said in December. Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, a social trading and investment platform, thinks short covering, or the buying in of assets that have been sold short (typically to avoid loss when prices move upwards) is the only reason for the green market.  “Especially after the short squeeze, we saw on Monday, today's action is simply a continuation of that. Markets are made of people and it's likely that most people will be looking to reduce their exposure before the holidays. Over the last few weeks, there have been a lot of high leveraged short positions building up and when those sell positions are closed, it creates upward pressure on market prices."" According to Greenspan, the evidence of this can be found hiding in plain sight as Bitcoin Cash is up by more than 40% in the past 24 hours and represents proof of this reason for market movements.  “Take a look at how Bitcoin Cash, which has probably been the most controversial of coins and many have blamed for the recent slide, is up about double of what the rest of the market has done today,” Greenspan adds. Meanwhile, on Wednesday evening, a popular crypto trader, known on Twitter as Blackbeard, asked his 33,000 followers to share their bitcoin price prediction for the end of this year. Out of almost 200 replies the majority estimated that bitcoin will close 2018 in a range of around USD 3,000 - USD 4,000.  Other cryptocurrencies are also in green: XRP has gained around 5%, ETH is close to 7% and the others follow similar upward slopes, while Bitcoin Cash is the clear winner with a 40% increase. In the top 50 coins by market cap, the only “loser” is Maker with -1%. Bitcoin’s market capitalization also hit a two-week high of USD 70 billion, while the price itself had not been seen above USD 4,000 since December 4th.  ____

" Yesterday, we saw a positive upward move above the USD 3,600 and USD 3,700 resistance levels. BTC/USD even traded above USD 3,900 and later corrected lower. However, downsides were limited and the price bounced back above USD 3,750. Similarly, ethereum extended gains towards USD 110 and later corrected lower. The USD 100 zone acted as a support and the price is still trading in a bullish zone. Bitcoin cash performed well recently and it broke the USD 130 and USD 140 resistance levels. The overall market sentiment is still positive (UTC 08:00 AM,) suggesting more gains in the near term.  Total market capitalization  There was a solid bullish extension above the USD 3,750 and USD 3,820 resistance levels in bitcoin price . BTC/USD broke the USD 3,900 barrier and later corrected lower. However, the previous resistance at USD 3,650 - USD 3,700 acted as a support and prevented further declines.
The price bounced back and traded above the USD 3,750 and USD 3,800 resistance levels. It is currently up around 3%, with an immediate resistance at USD 3,850. If buyers remain in action, the price is likely to clear the USD 3,900 and USD 3,950 resistance levels in the coming sessions. Ethereum price  traded close to the USD 108 - USD 110 resistance and later corrected lower. ETH/USD corrected below the USD 105 level, but the USD 100 support acted as a solid buy zone.
The price bounced back and it is currently up close to 3%. The first resistance for buyers is near the USD 105 level, above which the price may trade to a new weekly high, probably above USD 110. Bitcoin cash price  remained in a solid uptrend above the USD 120 resistance. BCH/USD gained more than 25% and it recently broke the USD 135 and USD 140 resistance levels. The next challenge for buyers is near the USD 148 - USD 150 zone. BCHSV also started a nice upward move and moved up by around 8%. It is currently trading near USD 90 and it may perhaps test the USD 95 or USD 100 resistance level.
Ripple price  climbed above the USD 0.380 resistance, but it faced a lot of offers near the USD 0.390 resistance. XRP/USD may continue to rise and it is likely to revisit the USD 0.380 or USD 0.390 resistance. Many small cap altcoins rallied recently by more than 10%, including STRAT, LINK, WAVES, PAY, AION and BCN. Out of these, STRAT performed really well and extended gains above the USD 1.40 resistance. Similarly, LINK broke the USD 0.30 resistance and gained close to 25%. To sum up, the market sentiment is pointing more gains in bitcoin above the USD 3,800 level. There are even chances of an upside acceleration above the USD 4,000 resistance in the near term (Update: bitcoin increased above USD 4,000 later today.) Similarly, ethereum could break the USD 110 resistance and ripple price may test the USD 0.400 resistance.

" The pre-Christmas week has been marked with bitcoin's price jumping almost 20% in three days and with other important developments for the whole Bitcoin network. As the competition among Bitcoin miners was dropping for more than a month, mining itself has become easier and the market bounced back this week, it encouraged some miners to strengthen their focus on the Bitcoin mining again.   The average hash rate, or computing power, of the Bitcoin network, that was decreasing for more than a month, started to picking up on December 14, or even before the price jump on Monday. Moreover, yesterday, the Bitcoin mining difficulty dropped less than estimated, or by 9.56%. BTC.com, a major mining pool, forecasted a 16% drop. However, now, the pool estimates that the difficulty will drop by another 8.22% in almost 13 days. Bitcoin hash rate: _____  The mining difficulty of Bitcoin is adjusted every two weeks (every 2016 blocks, to be precise) to maintain the normal 10-minute block time. This means that if there are many miners competing amongst themselves and propagating blocks in less than ten minutes, the difficulty of the next puzzle will be increased; if there are few miners and it takes them much longer to find a solution, the difficulty is decreased - both times just enough to keep block times at around 10 minutes. In this case, the previous average block time was close to 12 minutes, so the difficulty dropped on December 18th at around UTC 23.30, to bring block time closer to 10 minutes (still, it's around 11 minutes now). However, not everyone can take advantage of this situation. As reported, only a select few can afford to stay in the game: miners with scale, very specific business models and extremely low electricity costs. At the same time, many other miners are under growing pressure as the bitcoin price dropped by 80% since its all-time high in December of 2017. According to previous reports, between 600,000 and 800,000 Bitcoin miners have pulled the plug on their operations in the second half of November. Earlier in December, market analysis firm Autonomous Research estimated that at least 100,000 individual miners have shut down, and advisory firm Fundstrat Global Advisors added that since early September, about 1.4 million servers have been unplugged.  This flush out took the Bitcoin’s hash rate with it, which, as mentioned above, has started to grow again.",2018-12-19
" Famous venture capital investor and bitcoin enthusiast Tim Draper has invested in bitcoin merchant payment processor OpenNode, the company announced on Tuesday, as it concluded its seed round.  The investment from Draper and his Draper Associates, a seed-stage venture capital firm, totaled USD 1.25 million, according to multiple media reports. “With their backing, we plan to scale the team, build our network, and ultimately, push for hyperbitcoinization [Bitcoin-induced currency demonetization],” the startup added. OpenNode is a bitcoin-only payment processor that aims to enable all kinds of businesses to accept bitcoin payments for everyday items like coffee and groceries via the Lightning Network. The firm has recently launched its re-designed platform to the public, and is right now running a promotion where the platform will be free to use for the first 30 days. After that, the fee for using the payments processor will be 1% of transactions. Over the years, Draper’s company Draper Associates has invested in numerous crypto-related companies, including hardware wallet maker Ledger, fiat-to-crypto exchange Coinbase, and cross-border business transaction service BitPesa, to name a few. Tim Draper has made a name for himself in the crypto community with his highly optimistic bitcoin price predictions. Back in April of this year, he famously predicted that bitcoin would reach USD 250,000 within four years, joking that the “spirits told me.” Although some may think Draper was overly optimistic about bitcoin’s prospects, the investor does have a good track record with his forecasts: In 2014, he correctly predicted that bitcoin would pass USD 10,000 mark in 2017. It appears like Tim Draper is not the only famous billionaire who is still bullish on bitcoin. On Tuesday, former Wall Street banker and current Bitcoin bull Michael Novogratz said during a Bloomberg interview that he expects bitcoin to trade between USD 3,000 and USD 6,000 in the near future, while adding that “hopefully next year we’ll start seeing it move up.” Watch the interview below:",2018-12-19
" American financial services giant Western Union (WU) says they “will be ready” to add cryptocurrencies if crypto garners enough interest as they already boast more than 130 currencies. However, Western Union Global Money Transfer President Odilon Almeida doesn’t think the industry is there yet. In a video published by WU, Almeida considers the company is in the perfect position to benefit from the cryptocurrency movement in the long-term compared to any startup, given that they have “deep knowledge” about international money transfer, as well as millions of users. “Cryptocurrency might become one more option for a way for assets to be exchanged between people and countries. If that happens we would be ready to launch,” he said. He also explains that cryptocurrencies have so far failed to achieve mass adoption because they have yet to master three things: governance, compliance and volatility. However, in his opinion, WU is already better equipped to solve for such variables because it already moves money across 130 currencies and “devotes substantial resources to all of those three challenges.” Blockchain technology, however, does not run into those problems. Almeida makes a distinction between blockchain and cryptocurrencies, saying that the former “has a lot of potential,” adding that, “you’re gonna see more and more ways of using the technology going forward.” The company claims that, “There are many potential applications for the financial services sector, and WU is investing in finding those that best meet our platform,” further clarifying that WU has partnered with Ripple Labs to test whether sending payments by blockchain was faster and less expensive, but that “the tests are ongoing.” “Whenever I’m asked if Western Union will introduce a digital currency, I like to say that we have already done it decades ago,” Almeida said, referring to Western Union’s ability to transfer money digitally. “Western Union is ready today to adopt any kind of currency. We already operate with 130 currencies. If we, one day, feel like it’s the right strategy to introduce cryptocurrencies to our platform, technology-wise, it’s just one more currency.” His opinion resonates with the company’s earlier stance. Back in June, the company’s CEO Hikmet Ersek said WU won't be joining the crypto craze until these currencies become more widely used. As for the supposedly ongoing tests with Ripple Labs, WU has then stated that they had not seen a benefit from Ripple’s technology during a six-month trial period. In the third quarter, WU generated revenue of USD 1.4 billion, which declined 1% compared to the prior year, or increased 3% on a constant currency basis. Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) revenues, which represented 80% of total company revenue in the quarter, were flat on a reported basis, or increased 2% constant currency, while transactions grew 4%. According to WU, geographically, constant currency revenue growth was led by sends originated in Latin America, Europe, and North America, partially offset by declines in the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific.",2018-12-18
" Blockchain technology firm Blockstream announced that they have expanded their satellite service to cover the Asia-Pacific region, as well as adding support for Lightning Network transactions. Their Blockstream Satellite lets users transfer bitcoins through leased satellites, bringing the nascent technology closer to those who might otherwise be impeded in accessing it. As Phase 2 completes worldwide coverage, #BlockstreamSatellite takes #Bitcoin to new heights. Free and private access to Bitcoin #blockchain data is now available to everyone on 🌎. Where will Bitcoin go next? Video made by @Pixelmatic! ⛓️🛰️⚡️🌊🌐🚀🌕 pic.twitter.com/VyEjLRR48X Initially launched in August 2017, the satellite was first available to users from Africa, Europe and the Americas, with the goal to let users access Bitcoin without the need for an internet connection. Now, a new application programming interface (API) lets users send encrypted messages to each other from some of the remotest regions on Earth and pay for those message in bitcoin using the Lightning Network service. The company’s chief strategy officer, Samson Mow, told Forbes, “Bitcoin has always been about uncensorable money, and now we have uncensorable communications as well.”  Blockstream Satellite coverage: Meanwhile, CEO Adam Back added that he expects the new satellite and API to lead to increased development of smartphone and feature phone applications that link together Blockstream’s GreenAddress bitcoin wallet, its Liquid Network for enabling faster transactions between exchanges, and its Cryptocurrency Data Feed for real-time and historical bitcoin exchange data, developed in partnership with the New York Stock Exchange parent company.  Because the entire Bitcoin blockchain will be broadcast, even miners will be able to use the satellite connection for mining: “You could set up a bitcoin mining operation in the middle of the desert powered by solar,”  said Back. “While satellite communications are traditionally cost-prohibitive, Blockstream Satellite will finally allow developers to adopt satellite communications in their applications [...] Natural disaster notifications, secure personal messaging, and sending bitcoin market data to remote locations are just some of the exciting examples of the power of this service,” Chris Cook, head of the Blockstream Satellite project, was quoted as saying in the official announcement by the company. Meanwhile, some members of the cryptoverse just found a way how to use this new opportunity:  Instead of an angel or star on top my Christmas tree this year, I will put a satellite dish pointing to the Blockstream Satellite. Aesthetically pleasing no, practical yes.   However, one needs to build a receiver first, that might cost around USD 139, according to a Blockstream Satellite parts list published on Amazon. Also, on its Github page, the company explains how to set-up this satellite.  Using a peer-to-peer system both for sending funds and communicating, especially during natural disasters, has been the focus of many other projects as well. One of them is Proof of Life, made by a group of developers using a portable hard drive, a solar battery pack, a shortwave radio, and a lot of technical knowledge. This off-grid technology is not just meant to be used for sending cryptocurrencies - it also guarantees the ability to send immutable information all over the world without relying on the grid. For example, victims of disasters could communicate with the outside world, making rescue operations and getting help much more efficient.",2018-12-18
" Despite the year-long bear market in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the 1-year anniversary of Bitcoin’s all-time high was marked by a significant bounce in prices across all major cryptocurrencies. Over the past 24 hours (UTC 07:07 AM), bitcoin was up nearly 8%, while XRP and Ethereum traded up by roughly 16% and 9%, respectively. Strongest among the top 100 digital assets, however, was EOS, which added about a quarter of its price in just 24 hours. December 17, 2018 was the date we remember as the all-time high for the bitcoin price, nearly reaching the milestone USD 20,000 on most exchanges, while surpassing that number on some others. Today – one year later – bitcoin is trading around USD 3,500, after a decline of more than 80%. Top 10 coins today: (UTC 07:05 AM) According to a Bloomberg report on Monday, David Thomas, director and co-founder at crypto brokerage GlobalBlock suggested that major cryptocurrencies have become cheap, saying investors for the first time in a long while are now seeing “value in getting back into the [crypto] market,” and that this seems to be what is driving the market higher now. Meanwhile, Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, reminded that the massive slide in bitcoin value this year may seem unprecedented, ""but in fact, retracements of this magnitude have happened no less than four times in Bitcoin's short history."" ""Because cryptoassets are such a new concept, we are still finding ways to figure out what the value of them should be. All assets in every market go through price discovery, but due to the rapid growth of the crypto industry, this process of price discovery is currently on steroids,"" Greenspan added. CNBC also ran a story on Monday where they reviewed all of the bullish price predictions that were given to bitcoin at its all-time high a year ago. The show host then went on to ask Spencer Bogart, a blockchain venture capitalist, a partner at Blockchain Capital, about his earlier forecast, to which he simply replied that his company is a “long-term venture investor,” although he added that bitcoin “could absolutely” go to USD 50,000, given that bitcoin cannot be valued in the same way as a typical company. Bogart also added that “the fundamentals have not changed” and that “2018 has been a fantastic year for bitcoin” when you ignore the price, pointing to things like the Lightning Network being enabled on bitcoin, professional custody services entering the space, as well as the Yale and Harvard endowments making investments. “I think anywhere between here and 2,000 or 1,000 is just a fantastic buying opportunity. I think when we look back 24 months from now, even 12 months from now, we’re gonna say ‘why didn’t I buy then?’,” Bogard concluded the interview by saying. In a separate tweet Bogart said there are three sources of BTC demand in years ahead:
“1) Generational shift (teenagers want crypto more than cash & gift cards)
2) Central banks & institutions (demand for non-sovereign digital asset w/ absolute scarcity)
3) Programmable money (the opportunities of natively digital money = HUGE)”

" Tagomi Holdings Inc, an electronic brokerage offering prime services for cryptocurrency investors, today announced it is live and executing client trades, and that it has received the backing of several notable investors.  The brokerage was co-founded by Greg Tusar, former global head of electronic trading at Goldman Sachs Group, who is working alongside co-founders Jennifer Campbell (CEO), and Marc Bhargava, the company’s president. Tagomi claims it has raised USD 16 million from investors such as Peter Thiel’s (co-founder of PayPal) venture-capital firm, Founders Fund, Collaborative Fund, SV Angel, Digital Currency Group, and others.  The company bills itself as bringing “robust infrastructure and institutional services that sophisticated investors need to trade at scale.” They are not an exchange, however: the company works with digital asset trading venues, OTC desks, and others to execute trades across multiple liquidity venues, their website explains.  “Cryptocurrency trading lacks the transparency and sophisticated execution that top family offices and wealth management firms have come to expect,"" said one of the backers, Joe Lonsdale, Founder of Palantir and Addepar, two American software companies.  “Our focus is on providing our clients, which include financial institutions, high net worth individuals and other sophisticated digital asset investors, a comprehensive solution that eases the operational challenges associated with trading at scale in this emerging asset class.” Campbell was quoted as saying in a press release. Meanwhile, Tusar told Bloomberg that the current environment is challenging, ""but we think there’s a lot of longer-term demand for digital assets and helping clients understand the transformative impact of crypto and blockchain.” Tagomi’s investors generally have a long-term view when it comes to digital assets and cryptocurrencies, said Tusar, adding that the team began building the platform in March.  ""The people we’re engaging so far are still interested and engaged because they see what this technology can do over the long-term,"" Tusar said. The company’s website reiterates their belief that the platform is either for a “sophisticated investor or organization” or “an institution who demands a high level of regulatory compliance.” Investors who want to place orders of USD 10 million for Bitcoin, for example, might be limited if no exchange is able to handle the order. However, Tagomi only takes customers from certain jurisdictions in order to comply with laws and regulations, and requires all customers to go through their compliance on-boarding process.",2018-12-17
" This past week, there was a downward move below USD 3,350 and USD 3,250 in bitcoin. BTC/USD even broke the USD 3,200 support area and tested the USD 3,150 support area. Later, the price recovered and it seems like there could be more upsides above USD 3,300 and USD 3,350 in the coming sessions. Similarly, ethereum price stayed above the USD 80 support and it is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) correcting higher towards the USD 90 and USD 95 resistance levels. Ripple price remained stable and it is currently facing a lot of hurdles near the USD 0.295 and USD 0.300 resistance levels. Total market capitalization  After forming a decent support near USD 3,150, bitcoin price  started an upward move. BTC/USD gained pace above the USD 3,200 level and it is currently trading above USD 3,250. If buyers remain in action, there are chances of more gains above the USD 3,300 and USD 3,350 resistance levels in the near term.
The main weekly resistances are at USD 3,400 and USD 3,500, above which bitcoin will most likely move into a bullish zone. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,200, below which the price could test the weekly support at USD 3,150. Ethereum price  retested the USD 80 support area recently where buyers emerged. ETH/USD is currently moving higher and it seems like it could even break the USD 88 and USD 90 resistances.
However, the key weekly resistance is near the USD 98 - USD 100 zone, which may continue to stop gains in the near term. If there is a successful close above USD 100, the price may move into a medium term bullish trend. Bitcoin cash  declined heavily this past week and broke the USD 100, USD 95 and USD 90 support levels. BCH/USD is currently trading near the USD 80 support, with resistance at USD 85 and USD 90. BCHSV also followed BCH and declined below the USD 80 support. It is currently recovering, but it won’t be easy for buyers to clear the USD 80 and USD 85 resistance levels.
Ripple price  is currently flat near the USD 0.285 support level. To start a solid upward move, XRP/USD must move above the USD 0.295 and USD 0.300 resistance levels. The key weekly support is at USD 0.280, below which there could be a sharp decline. During the past few hours, a few small cap altcoins gained traction and moved up by more than 10%, including R, FCT, ARB, MGO and MOAC. Out of these, revain (R) rallied more than 35% and factom (FCT) is up close to 28%. Overall, bitcoin price seems to be preparing for a short term rebound above USD 3,300. Having said that, BTC/USD must break the USD 3,400 and USD 3,500 resistance levels for a larger recovery in the near term. If there is no positive move above the USD 3,400 level, then bitcoin and altcoins like ethereum, ripple, litecoin, eos, neo and tron are likely to resume bearish moves.

" Famous Bitcoin bull Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, is staying optimistic in spite of everything. In a note on Thursday, he said that Bitcoin’s current price of USD 3,400 is wrong because its actual fair market value is between USD 13,800 and USD 14,800, given the number of active wallet addresses, usage per account and factors influencing supply. (The second part of the article updated with a commentary from Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro.) Although hisinitial prediction was for Bitcoin to reach USD 25,000 by the end of 2018, he amended that to a range of USD 20,000 - USD 22,000. When the market started getting more bearish, his prediction went down to around USD 15,000 as he stated the price would triple by the end of the year. Now, this divergence of more than four times the current price can be explained by last year’s meteoric rally, a “meltdown” in the macroeconomic climate and treasury sales during initial coin offerings, he believes. “Fair value is significantly higher than the current price of Bitcoin,” he wrote in his note, reported by Bloomberg, adding, “In fact, working backwards, to solve for the current price of Bitcoin, this implies crypto wallets should fall to 17 million from 50 million currently.”  As reported, Chris Burniske, author of the popular book on cryptoassets, and partner of venture firm Placeholder, also believes that the fundamentals of Bitcoin and Ethereum networks have not fallen as much as prices have. Moreover, the number of verified cryptoasset users climbed from 18 million to 35 million this year, almost doubling, all in the first three quarters of 2018.  Meanwhile, Lee claims that user adoption is the key to Bitcoin’s price boom: if Bitcoin wallets approach just 7 percent of Visa’s 4.5 billion account holders, fair value would be USD 150,000 per Bitcoin according to his model, he believes - and he refuses to update his forecast for the end of the year. The community is pretty divided in reaction to his forecast.  Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, reacted in a daily commentary:  ""In my personal philosophy, the market is never wrong. Fair value is what someone is willing to pay for it. I can understand how using metrics to try and determine what the price of an asset should be can be helpful. However, if nobody is willing to pay that amount, then it isn't the correct value."" According to him, ""Thomas even went as far as trying to reverse engineer his own calculations showing how given the current price of bitcoin, there should be far fewer active wallets. This thinking sounded a bit silly to me as well."" ""Sure, I believe that bitcoin can grow in value very quickly. After all, there is an extremely limited supply. But for that to happen demand needs to pick up first,"" Greenspan added. However, there are those that want to believe Lee: He's a super nice, interesting guy but he's dead wrong currently on both equities and bitcoin. While Reddit user u/lazyhippopotamus writes, “It's obvious. The market is definitely being manipulated heavily, and we're the ones losing money over it.” However, people in this club are few and far between, with many more taking to ridiculing the Bitcoin bull over all his forecasts. “Isn't the market always right and can't only people predicting it be wrong?” asks u/Frag1le, while u/SacrificesForMoloch writes, “The dude who has been wrong all year is saying the market is wrong... Yah OK. Don't listen to these charlatans.” The majority of the community on Twitter shares this opinion: user @Salt_Water_Croc says, “Even a noob who joined market yesterday can predict better and closer price to reality. What an idiot this #TomLee is.” Price predictions for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a dime a dozen, since pretty much everyone can make a prediction that might come true in such a volatile market. As data analyst Nick Maggiulli put it, “Where did all these people go wrong? When they made a Bitcoin price prediction in the first place. You CANNOT predict chaotic systems.” Meanwhile, New York-based research company Delphi Digital estimates that the price of Bitcoin may go up in 2019, after bottoming out in the first quarter of the year.",2018-12-14
" Companies in English-speaking countries all over the world have reportedly received bomb threats from people claiming to have planted explosive devices in recipients’ buildings – which they will only refrain from detonating should they receive USD 20,000 in Bitcoin. Police forces across the United States say they have received multiple reports of emailed threats, with similar announcements made in New Zealand. However, numerous police spokespeople have already called the threats a “hoax.” And it seems any would-be scammers have so far failed utterly in their efforts – with zero transactions recorded in the scammers’ wallet the time of writing (UTC 05:50 AM). __ Dammit, I guess I sent it to the wrong address.

In some emails, the apparent scammers claimed they would only “call off” their “man” if the recipients made a Bitcoin transfer.

" A market manipulation tactic called wash trading makes up over 80% of the Coinmarketcap top 25 Bitcoin pairs volume, a new report claims. The actual volume of most of these pairs is under 1% of their reported volume, and only two of the top 25 BTC pairs, listed on Binance and Bitfinex, do not suffer from this. A wash trade is a form of market manipulation in which an investor simultaneously sells and buys the same financial instruments to create misleading, artificial activity in the marketplace. The report, done by the Blockchain Transparency Institute (BTI,) a group of blockchain data researchers and enthusiasts, claims that the biggest offender is the OKEx exchange, as the team claims that it found almost all of their top 30 traded tokens to be engaging in wash trading when processed through their algorithms.  However, even the estimated adjusted volume for them would still keep them in the top 10 exchanges. Some other mentioned exchanges are Huobi, HitBTC and Bithumb, the latter reportedly engaging in wash trading primarily with Monero, Dash, Bitcoin Gold, and ZCash and changing those pairs monthly. Top 25 BTC trading pairs on Coinmarketcap: This manipulation tactic is dangerous for any aspiring token projects, as they pay exorbitant fees to be listed on exchanges that they believe hold a large trading volume and might offer high liquidity. The report adds that the average project spent over USD 50,000 this year in listing fees in order to add their tokens on exchanges which practice wash trading, and this adds up to an estimated USD 100 million only in 2018. They add, “With over 50 exchanges wash trading over 95% of their volumes, this is a 500K a year scheme, with some exchanges making over one million dollars this year just from collecting these fees.” Top 25 BTC trading pairs by BTI: The fake trading volume issue is a long-standing one in the cryptocurrency world. Aside from wash trading, some exchanges engage in other manipulative behavior such as transaction mining, where they return a portion of the trading fees paid by users when they place orders on the exchange in the form of the exchange’s own token.

" The past few sessions were mostly neutral for bitcoin as it continues to trade in a range with a bearish angle below USD 3,450. BTC/USD is struggling to rebound, which might result in a strong bearish reaction below USD 3,350 or USD 3,300 in the coming sessions. Similarly, ethereum price failed to surpass the USD 95 and USD 100 resistance levels on a couple of occasions. Ripple price is stuck just above USD 0.300 and below USD 0.310. Therefore, bitcoin and altcoins could either start a decent rebound soon or they might breakdown to new yearly lows. Total market capitalization  There were mostly range moves below the USD 3,450 resistance level in bitcoin price . BTC/USD seems to be struggling (UTC 08:20 AM) near the USD 3,450 and USD 3,500 resistances. A successful close above the USD 3,500 barrier could clear the path for buyers to take control in the near term.
If buyers continue to fail near the USD 3,450 and USD 3,500 resistances, there could be a strong bearish reaction. A break below the USD 3,350 level may perhaps accelerate losses towards the USD 3,300 or USD 3,220 levels. Ethereum price  failed recently near the USD 91 level and declined below USD 90. ETH/USD is currently consolidating just above USD 88, with resistances near the USD 91, USD 94, USD 96 and USD 98 levels. 
If there is no break above the stated levels and USD 100, the price might decline to USD 80 or even USD 75. A break above USD 100 could improve the market sentiment in favor of buyers. Bitcoin cash price  extended declines below the USD 98 support level. BCH/USD is down more than 1% and it is currently near USD 95. The main support is at USD 92, followed by USD 90. BCHSV is down around 5% and it is currently trading near the USD 85 support. If the price continues to slide, there could be a test of USD 80.
Ripple price  remained confined in a tight range above the USD 0.300 support. XRP/USD must surpass the USD 0.308 and USD 0.310 resistance levels to gain bullish momentum. If not, the price may drop significantly to USD 0.280 or USD 265. During the past few hours, a few small cap altcoins gained bullish momentum and jumped more than 10%, including BTCP, PAY, DEX, QTUM and WAVES. Out of these, BTCP rallied around 14% and PAY climbed close to 13%. The current price action is slightly bearish for bitcoin below USD 3,450. If BTC/USD continues to struggle, there is a high possibility of a breakdown below USD 3,350 and USD 3,300 in the near term. Conversely, if there is an upside break above USD 3,450 and USD 3,500, bitcoin and altcoins such as ethereum, ripple, eos and litecoin may stage a solid comeback.

" Recently, there was a downside extension in bitcoin price below the USD 3,440 and USD 3,400 support levels. BTC/USD tested the USD 3,325 level and later started consolidating in a range above USD 3,350. Ethereum price also declined and traded below the USD 90 support. However, the price remained above the USD 84 low and it is currently (UTC 08:10 AM) attempting a recovery towards USD 94. On the other hand, ripple price was stable and dips below USD 0.300 were well supported. The current technical structure suggests range trading before bitcoin makes the next move. Total market capitalization  There were further declines below the USD 3,440 level in bitcoin price . BTC/USD even broke the USD 3,400 support and traded towards the USD 3,300 level. It found support neat the USD 3,325 level and later the price corrected a few points. 
The price is currently trading just below the USD 3,400 level, above which there are chances of a recovery towards the USD 3,450 level. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,350 followed by USD 3,325. If there are more losses, the price may trade to a new yearly low below USD 3,225. Ethereum price  struggled to recover above the USD 94 and USD 95 resistance levels. ETH/USD declined further and it traded below the USD 90 level.
Buyers appeared near the USD 87 - USD 88 zone and the price is currently consolidating losses. On the upside, an initial hurdle is near the USD 92 level, above which the price may rise towards the USD 95 level. Bitcoin cash price  failed to stay above the USD 100 support and it recently declined around 3%. BCH/USD is currently trading near the USD 96 level, with an immediate support at USD 95 followed by USD 92. BCHSV declined below the USD 90 support recently before buyers appeared near the USD 85 level. It is currently recovering, but it may face sellers near USD 90 or USD 92.
Ripple price  dipped below the USD 0.300 support level, but it quickly recovered. XRP/USD is currently up around 0.5% and it may climb towards the USD 0.308 and USD 0.314 resistance levels. Despite bearish moves in bitcoin, a few small cap altcoins climbed higher by more than 10%, including DEX, CREDO, WAVES, XTZ, REP and PAY. Out of these, DEX rallied around 45% and CREDO climbed close to 36%. Overall, bitcoin seems to be trading in a range below USD 3,500 with a bearish angle. BTC/USD must climb above the USD 3,450 and USD 3,500 resistance levels to start a solid recovery. If not, there is a risk of more declines below USD 3,300 and USD 3,200 in the coming sessions. Similarly, ethereum could decline below USD 84 and USD 80 if it continues to fail near the USD 95 and USD 100 resistance levels.

" The price of Bitcoin may go up in 2019, after bottoming out in the first quarter of the year, shows a new paper by New York-based research company Delphi Digital. The bottom might well happen in the first half of Q1 due to the recent acceleration in Bitcoin’s downward trend. They also believe that the Lightning Network’s success could prove crucial to wider Bitcoin usage.  The research paper, titled “The State of Bitcoin,” found that the primary source of selling in the most recent downturn for Bitcoin came from coin owners who have been holding for 3 to 5 years, and these very same HODLers seem close to exhausting their selling efforts. This is derived from UTXO (unspent transaction output) trends, which the paper says “have shown to be an impressively reliable predictor, albeit with a limited sample history, for price bottoms, future accumulation timing, and UTXO wave amplitudes.” The UTXO trend and subsequent price appreciation should line up with the Bitcoin block mining reward halving that is set to happen in 2020, when the reward will decrease from 12.5 to 6.25 bitcoins, but the research team believes that this will be the last reward halving to have a very significant impact on price. Block mining reward halving occurs once every 210,000 blocks, which translates to around once every four years. Historically, there have been two halvings: in 2012 and 2016, both of which were followed by significant bull runs.  Block mining reward halving and Bitcoin price chart: ____ The short-term outlook in the paper draws a parallel to 2013: back then, when the prices peaked in late 2013 and subsequently fell, they continued to slip even after year-over-year returns turned negative. It was roughly a year before Bitcoin returned to similar price levels. The price’s rise of late 2017 mimics that of 2013, as peak valuations were followed by an extended bear market, characterized by multiple relief rallies on the way to drastically lower prices, but the bottom does not seem to be too far off.  In the long run, Bitcoin may well replace offshore accounts as the means to holding private wealth. Once Bitcoin rises in popularity for this reason, more conservative institutions (central banks, state and local pension funds, etc.) are likely to follow suit as they become more comfortable with digital assets, the paper claims. The researchers remain optimistic, however: “Barring any major disruptions to its network, however, over the long run we foresee Bitcoin serving as a staple allocation in traditional investment portfolios, central bank reserves, and as a suitable alternative for a portion of assets held in offshore accounts.” But in order to be used as a currency, Bitcoin still has quite a way to go. “In order for Bitcoin to work as a medium of exchange, we believe it first needs to establish itself as a store of value to help reduce its volatility,” the paper states, adding that the current volatility of the asset makes it less likely for holders to spend it, as they believe it might become worth more in the future, and eliminating this possibility could be the nudge Bitcoin needs towards becoming a medium of exchange. ""If Lightning Network succeeds, it will enable Bitcoin to have nearly instant transactions and fees at potentially a fraction of a cent. This opens the door for fast micropayments where users could pay a penny to read an article or receive small tips from fans on social media. This provides unique advantages over the current web based payments infrastructure which is saddled with middle-men, delays in settlement, and high transaction fees,"" according to Delphi Digital.",2018-12-11
" There was an increase in selling pressure on bitcoin recently, resulting in a bearish move below USD 3,450. BTC/USD is currently (UTC 08:10 AM) trading near the USD 3,400 support level and it seems to be struggling near the USD 3,500 and USD 3,550 resistance levels. Ethereum clearly struggled to clear the USD 95 and USD 100 resistance levels. ETH/USD is currently trading below USD 90 and it may slide towards USD 85. Ripple price continues to consolidate near the USD 0.300 support, with an immediate resistance at USD 0.312. The price action is short term bearish unless bitcoin price breaks the USD 3,500 and USD 3,550 resistances in the coming sessions. Total market capitalization  There was a rejection noted near the USD 3,550 level in bitcoin price , resulting in a downward move. BTC/USD declined below the USD 3,450 support and it is currently down around 2%. An immediate support is at USD 3,400, below which the price could drop sharply towards the USD 3,250 support level.
On the flip side, if buyers continue to protect USD 3,400, there is a chance of an upward move towards the USD 3,500 level. However, the price must convincingly break the USD 3,500 and USD 3,550 resistance levels to stage a decent rebound in the near term. Ethereum price  is currently consolidating near the USD 88 - USD 90 area. ETH/USD was recently rejected near the USD 100 hurdle (the previous support zone).
If there are more losses below USD 88, the price may revisit the last swing low near USD 84. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 94, above which the price may retest the key USD 98 - USD 100 resistance zone. Bitcoin cash price  is down around 2.5% and it moved below the USD 100 support. It seems like BCH/USD may continue to correct lower towards the USD 95 support level. BCHSV is down more than 6% and it seems like buyers failed to hold gains above the USD 100 and USD 95 support levels. The next key support awaits near USD 90, below which the price may decline to USD 85.
Ripple price  is facing a solid resistance near the USD 0.312 and USD 0.320 levels. XRP/USD is currently consolidating above USD 0.300 and it may continue to trade in a range before the next move either above USD 0.320 or below USD 0.300. A few small cap altcoins declined more than 8% recently, including MOAC, FCT, MANA, DCR, ELF, R, MGO and KMD. Out of these, MOAC is down around 17% and FCT fell close to 13%. To sum up, bitcoin buyers seem to be facing a major resistance near the USD 3,500 and USD 3,550 levels. If BTC/USD fails to climb above USD 3,550, there is a chance of a fresh decline below USD 3,400 and 3,350 in the near term. Similarly, ethereum and ripple may decline heavily if they fail to move past USD 100 and USD 0.320 respectively.

" There are possible signs that investors in Turkey, a country with population of 80 million people, may be turning their backs on the lira – and buying cryptocurrencies instead. Slate cites a study by Turkish researcher Twentify, which found that around 1 in 5 respondents said they had begun trading in cryptocurrencies after August this year, when the lira took a massive tumble in price. (However, since then it has recovered by 26% against the dollar.) Inflation in the country also remains high (21.62% year-on-year in November), another factor that has led investors to seek out ways to protect the value of their savings. Reuters reports that Turkish economic growth has “dwindled to 1.6% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2018” – down from 7% in 2017. TRY/USD chart: ____ Per a report in Turkish media outlet DHA, trading on certain Turkish crypto exchanges increased by 37% in November, peaking at a weekly increase of 72% in the week beginning November 12. However, the whole crypto market saw higher trading volumes in November due to huge sell off.  Meanwhile, Slate quotes Emin Gün Sirer, a Turkish-American professor at Cornell University, who says the country’s “relatively young population compared [to the rest of] Europe, and [their] flexible adoption of new technology provide the conditions for an eager market for cryptocurrency.” In a column for Hürriyet Daily News, journalist and business expert Ersu Ablak stated, “It makes me happy that the latest cryptocurrency investments involve Turkey [...] This is partly due to the fact that Turkish people are very adaptable to new technologies and new methods.” The country’s chief religious body, the Directorate of Religious Affairs, has previously ruled that cryptocurrency use is not permissible under Islamic law, but State author Sara Nasser concludes that, nonetheless, “cryptocurrency is an attractive, but risky dream” for many Turks. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, recently interacted with Turkish crypto-enthusiasts on Twitter, expressing his surprise at the size of the country’s crypto-community. Istanbul will also host one of the AME region’s biggest blockchain and cryptocurrency-themed forums, the Blockchain Economy Summit, in February next year. ____

" Everyone has their own guess as to what Bitcoin will be worth in any amount of time. However, some predictions garner special attention: for example, software tycoon John McAfee first said Bitcoin would reach USD 500,000 by the end of 2020 and promised he’d eat his external genitalia on national television if that doesn’t happen, later amending his prediction to say it’d go up to USD 1 million while the previous promise still stands. Because this is the internet, there is a website that follows McAfee’s prediction and measures how much Bitcoin would have to rise for McAfee’s nethers to stay intact. Also, the website, called bircoin.top, lets you add your own parameters to see how your own prediction would pan out, or even check other famous predictions.  __ McAfee announced his prediction on July 17th, 2017, and according to mathematics, the price would need to grow at a rate of around 0.5% per day from that day on to reach the predicted million. Although half a percent may not sound like much, it is still an exponential growth curve that gets steeper the further it goes. With this steady growth rate, Bitcoin would have to be worth USD 26,400 today for it to be on track for the end of 2020 - but it is scarcely above USD 3,500, around 86% less than what the prediction needs, or around 416 days behind. And there are many predictions: from Tom Lee, of Fundstrat Advisors, expecting USD 15,000 per bitcoin by the end of 2018, to Tim Draper betting on USD 250,000 per bitcoin by 2022. Meanwhile, data analyst Nick Maggiulli says that their mistake was making a prediction in the first place. “You CANNOT predict chaotic systems,” he adds in a tweet. Where did all these people go wrong?   When they made a Bitcoin price prediction in the first place. You CANNOT predict chaotic systems.  It’s the Three Body Problem. pic.twitter.com/IeMJQ761Sw Co-founder of first Chinese cryptocurrency exchange BTCC, Bobby Lee, took to Twitter to share his own opinion and ask the community to do the same. If history repeats perfectly, then the current bear market for #Bitcoin would bottom out at $2,500 next month, in Jan 2019.And then the next rally would start in late 2020, peak out in Dec 2021 at $333,000, and then crash back down to $41,000 in Jan 2023.Something like that?🙂 https://t.co/M8ljIVnt73 Later, Lee asked his followers whether this will happen - 59% of respondents believe in this, by the way, and over half believe that the peak of USD 333,000 is the least likely to happen out of all four predictions. However, all this proves is that anyone can make predictions. The community has always been skeptical, however, and many predictions (and the people making them) are notoriously wrong. Still, if you’re craving some fun, make your own prediction - there are no prerequisites to it - and if you get something right, maybe you’ll get famous.",2018-12-10
" The fundamentals of Bitcoin and Ethereum networks have not fallen as much as prices have, author of the popular book Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond, Chris Burniske, writes in a blog post. In his research, he found that the fundamentals are outperforming the prices currently, although all of them are down since December 2017 and January 2018. Although there are many who do not believe cryptocurrency networks have any fundamentals at all, Burniske believes that this role is filled by health of the supply-siders and demand-siders. Supply-siders are those who provision the network’s service, in most cases miners, and demand-siders are the ones who consume the service. The research focuses on Bitcoin and Ethereum, comparing how fundamentals and network values have performed since December 17th, 2017, and January 13th, 2018 - the peak network values for both.  What he found is that, although network values (“Network Value” = “Price per Unit” x “Units of the Cryptoasset Outstanding”) were down, the number of daily transactions as well as demand for their native functionality is not following suit. Hash rates, or processing power of a cryptocurrency network, of both are up compared to their peaks; although they are on negative slopes, they are still outperforming the price. Another supply-side component are developers, and Burniske writes that according to the internal analysis of venture firm Placeholder, of which he is a partner, those metrics are also outperforming the market. “Most asset classes have widely agreed-upon models to value them; analysts just bicker over the inputs to those models. In crypto, we currently bicker over both the models and the inputs, hence the insane whiplash of the markets,” Burniske concludes, adding that the growth of network fundamentals is sure to attract analysts which, in turn, will help stabilize the market. In reply to Burniske’s tweet featuring his article, the crypto community points out that taking the peak values from the December 17 - January 18 time frame means assuming that the market priced network value correctly back then. My main issue with your analysis, and I may be missing something obvious here, but - by using network value/fundamentals calculation at the peaks, it seems that you assume that the market priced network value correctly back then. “What if at the peak of the mania (at that seems to have been mania phase) [network value] got ahead of fundamentals by, say, 300%? Wouldn't it mean market still searches for a fair price which may be lower? Even if NV/fundamentals equations does not show that?” asks user @Staska.  Burniske wrote about that in a comment on Medium, “We could solve [the overvalued market problem] by looking at the cycles over time, checking in at troughs and peaks, and looking at the relative change in fundamentals and prices between the two. A more time intensive analysis, but doable.” However, he did not add whether he intends to do such research in the future. On this potential overvaluation also hangs the question: is the current market drop a justifiable correction? However, with the lack of data, “it’s clear to me that Mr. (Crypto) Market has only a vague idea of what he’s doing right now,” Burniske adds.",2018-12-10
" This past week, we saw an extended decline in bitcoin price below the USD 3,500 and USD 3,400 support levels. BTC/USD tested the USD 3,200 - USD 3,220 support area and later recovered. The price traded above USD 3,400, but there are many resistances near USD 3,600 and USD 3,640. Ethereum price settled below the USD 100 support area. ETH/USD traded towards the USD 80 level and later started forming a support base near USD 85. Ripple price failed to surpass the USD 0.355 resistance and it recently tested the USD 0.300 support. The overall price structure is currently neutral above recent lows, with chances of a short term upside correction in bitcoin and altcoins. Total market capitalization  There was a decent upward move above the USD 3,400 resistance in bitcoin price . BTC/USD is currently up around 2% and it is trading near the USD 3,500 level. On the upside, an initial support is at USD 3,540, above which the price may test the USD 3,600 level. The main weekly resistance is near USD 3,640, above which there are chances of a decent rebound toward USD 4,000 and USD 4,200.
On the flip side, the USD 3,450 is a short term support. If buyers fail to surpass the USD 3,540 resistance, there could be a fresh drop below the USD 3,450 and USD 3,400 supports. The key weekly support is at USD 3,200, below which the price may even decline below USD 3,000 or USD 2,800. Ethereum price  declined heavily this past week and settled below the USD 100 level. ETH/USD traded close to the USD 80 level and later it corrected higher.
On the upside, the price is facing a couple of important hurdles near USD 95 and USD 100. A daily close above the USD 100 level could really boost the market sentiment in favor of buyers. If there is no break and close above USD 100, the price may decline towards USD 80 or USD 75. Bitcoin cash  is back above the USD 100 support. BCH/USD must break the USD 110 and USD 120 resistance levels to start a decent rebound in the near term. On the other hand, BCHSV declined below USD 100 and it is currently trading above the USD 98 support below which the price may slide towards USD 92.
Ripple price  climbed back above USD 0.300 and it is currently consolidating losses. XRP/USD is facing resistance near the USD 0.310 and USD 0.315 levels, and supports on the downside are USD 0.300 and USD 0.292. A few small cap altcoins gained bullish momentum recently and jumped more than 8%, including DEX, CENNZ, ELF, XIN, MAID, ETP and EOS. Out of these, DEX rallied more than 50% and CENNZ is up close to 20%. Overall, bitcoin price is currently consolidating above USD 3,400. To start a substantial recovery, BTC/USD must break the USD 3,640 resistance. If not, there is a risk of a fresh bearish wave in bitcoin and altcoins like ethereum, ripple, litecoin, eos, neo and tron in the near term.

" The entire crypto market sold off heavily between Thursday night and Friday morning, sending Bitcoin down more than 10% over the past 24 hours to go below the USD 3,300 mark before recovering slightly. However, it seems that the general sentiment has not changed yet - despite the the market crash could get worse, cryptocurrencies  have great potential, still.   Now, even the two “stars” of this week - Waves (-20%) and Factom (-31%) - fell sharply, trimming their weekly gains to 25% and 12% respectively (UTC 06:15 AM).  The sharp losses came after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said they would further postpone a decision on whether to approve the much-anticipated bitcoin-backed exchange traded fund (ETF) by financial firm VanEck. The new deadline now is set to February 27, 2019. Top 10 coins  (UTC 06:35 AM) ____ Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, doesn't rule out that bitcoin could be headed straight for USD 1,500, as some analysts predict. ""Anything is possible but I would say that we have a lot of key levels before that will more than likely support the price. As you can see, we're currently testing the light support level at USD 3,500 (blue). If it breaks through to the downside we will likely encounter heavy support at USD 3,000 yellow. The red line is set at USD 1,800. All of these levels have played a significant role during the rise of 2017,"" the analyst wrote in a daily commentary on Thursday. According to him, for institutional investors looking to invest in the assets rather than the infrastructure, there really isn't much reason to go in strong at the moment. ""There simply isn't FOMO [fear of missing out],"" Greenspan stressed. ""However thinking long term, if we do think that bitcoin will pass through the all-time highs anytime within the next decade, it won't make much sense to wait until it USD 1,500 to start placing orders. Rather, large traders tend to set small orders in order to average out their entries,"" he added. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Tone Vays says that at least for now “it’s getting worse”: Taking a short break from #LABITCONF2018 to bring you guys a #Bitcoin price update. $BTCUSD charts looked very Bearish at this time yesterday & unfortunately it's getting worse.https://t.co/8jdBqlcV0a ___ Ethereum, which for a long-time held the position as the second-most valuable cryptocurrency, traded down by over 16% Friday morning, reaching price levels not seen since May 2017. Together with Stellar and EOS, ETH was one of the biggest losers among the top 10 coins over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency also experienced an extremely unusual event overnight when it saw a flash-crash on the Coinbase Pro platform, briefly sending it down to USD 13 before recovering, in what can only be described as a spectacular flash-crash. Coinbase Pro responded to the incident, simply saying they are “aware of price movement,” without admitting any kind of fault: So market selling through 88% of the orderbook on eth/usdc is working as normal ? It is still unclear exactly what caused the sudden drop in the ETH price, but the extremely quick sell-off and subsequent recovery is likely a sign of trading algorithms creating a snowball effect, for example triggered by a large order or a “fat finger” entering a wrong order. The second major happening overnight was Bitcoin SV, the Bitcoin Cash fork that came into existence on November 15, overtaking the more mainstream Bitcoin ABC (usually referred to simply as Bitcoin Cash) in terms of market capitalization.

Coin birthed by a total fraud takes the lead. pic.twitter.com/G1hhcA5FsX ___ At the time of writing, the two are still swapping places among the most valuable cryptocurrencies, however, there is no clear winner at the moment.  In the community, many speculate if this is just a short-lived attempt from the Bitcoin SV camp and its main backer Craigh “faketoshi” Wright at pumping up the price of their coin. If that’s the case, the pumpers are likely to run out of new capital soon and the rally may be short-lived. Bitcoin Cash has seen a particularly sharp decline over recent weeks, as the internal divide in the BCH community has hurt both sides badly. As reported, Stellar overtook BCH as the 4th most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap.

" Yesterday, we saw bearish moves in bitcoin price below the USD 3,900 level. BTC/USD followed a negative trajectory and declined below the USD 3,800 and USD 3,750 supports. A new yearly low was formed below USD 3,700 before the price bounced back. Ethereum also declined heavily and broke the USD 105 and USD 100 support levels. Buyers appeared near USD 95 and later ETH/USD moved back above USD 100. On the other hand, declines in ripple were limited, but the price remained below the USD 0.355 and USD 0.350 support levels. Total market capitalization  There was a downside extension in bitcoin price  below the USD 3,850 support level. BTC/USD declined below the USD 3,800 and USD 3,750 levels and spiked below the USD 3,700 level. A new yearly low was formed near USD 3,670 and later the price bounced back above USD 3,800.
The price is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) flat around USD 3,860, with an immediate resistance near the USD 3,900 level. Above USD 3,900, the price could trade towards the key USD 4,000 resistance, which is likely to act as a strong resistance. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 3,800 followed by the USD 3,750 pivot zone. Ethereum price  struggled to break the USD 110 resistance, resulting in declines below USD 105. ETH/USD even broke the USD 100 support and traded to a new yearly low around USD 95.
Later, the price bounced back and traded above the USD 100 level. It is currently down 3% to USD 102, with an initial resistance at USD 105, above which the next key resistance is near the USD 110 level. Bitcoin cash  is under a lot of pressure and it is again down around 10% to USD 125. BCH declined below the USD 140 support recently and if sellers remain in action, the price could trade towards the USD 110 level. On the other hand, BCHSV traded higher by more than 5% and it is currently trading near the USD 90 level.
Ripple price  declined towards the USD 0.325 support area where buyers emerged. XRP/USD recovered and it is currently trading near USD 0.342, above which the price may test the USD 0.350 resistance. Many few small cap altcoins declined recently by more than 8% and moved further into a bearish zone, including DEX, XTZ, WAVES, MKR, AE, BTM, MITH, AION and BTS. Out of these, DEX is down around 16% and XTZ fell close to 15%. The current price action is still bearish below USD 4,000 for bitcoin. Should buyers push BTC/USD above the USD 4,000 resistance, there could be a decent recovery. If not, the price is likely to slide again below USD 3,800 and USD 3,700. Likewise, ethereum price must settle above USD 100 and move above USD 110, USD 115 and USD 120. If buyers continue to struggle, ETH/USD may extend declines below USD 95 and USD 90.

" Yesterday, we discussed that a decent recovery in bitcoin price won’t be easy. BTC/USD corrected above the USD 3,950 and USD 4,000 resistance levels, but sellers protected further gains above the USD 4,050 level. There was a fresh drop and the price moved below the USD 3,900 level. Similarly, ethereum price failed to settle above the USD 110 - USD 112 resistance and declined again. Ripple price is down more than 3% after it failed to break the USD 0.360 resistance level. The current (UTC 08:20 AM) market sentiment is bearish, suggesting more losses in bitcoin and altcoins in the short term. Total market capitalization  There was a slow and steady decline in bitcoin price  after buyers failed to clear the USD 4,050 level. BTC/USD moved down and traded below the USD 4,000 and USD 3,930 supports. An immediate support is near USD 3,800, below which there is a risk of a sharp decline towards the USD 3,600 level.
On the other hand, the price is facing many resistances near the USD 3,900 and USD 4,000 levels. A successful close above USD 4,000 may lift the market sentiment. Still, the price must break the USD 4,050 swing high for a decent rebound in the near term. Ethereum price  failed to gain pace above the USD 113 level, resulting in a fresh decline. ETH/USD is down more than 3% and it is currently trading well below the USD 110 level.
An initial support is at USD 105, below which the price may revisit the USD 100 support zone. To recover, buyers need to surpass the USD 112 and USD 115 resistance levels. Bitcoin cash  is down more than 10% and it traded below the USD 150 and USD 145 support levels. BCH is under a lot of pressure and it seems like it could even break the USD 130 level. BCHSV is also declined more than 7% and traded below the USD 90 support. The next support is at USD 82, below which the price may test USD 75.
Ripple price  faced a lot of selling interest near the USD 0.360 and USD 0.362 levels. XRP/USD declined and moved below the USD 0.355 support level. It seems like sellers are aiming for a test of the USD 0.332 support. Many few small cap altcoins faced an increased selling pressure and declined more than 8%, including NEXO, NPXS, MITH, EOS, ETP, AE, ETC, GXS, MANA, THETA and BAT. Out of these, NEXO is down around 20% and NPXS fell nearly 12%. However, Waves jumped by more than 33% in the past 24 hours due to positive news. Overall, bitcoin is back in a negative zone below USD 4,000. As long as BTC/USD is trading below the USD 4,100 and USD 4,200 pivot levels, there is a risk of more downsides in the near future. Ethereum also faces a major risk of heavy declines below USD 100 if buyers fail to push ETH/USD back above the USD 115 and USD 120 resistance levels.

" As many Bitcoin miners have turned off their machines, mining difficulty saw its second largest drop in history at -15% on December 3rd. It has helped to increase profitability for those who still run their mining rigs, but strengthened fears of centralization.  The mining difficulty of Bitcoin is adjusted every two weeks (every 2016 blocks, to be precise) to maintain the normal 10-minute block time. This means that if there are many miners competing amongst themselves and propagating blocks in less than ten minutes, the difficulty of the next puzzle will be increased; if there are few miners and it takes them much longer to find a solution, the difficulty is decreased - both times just enough to keep block times at around 10 minutes.  Now, the difficulty might drop another 16% after two weeks, according to estimations by major mining pool BTC.com. In that case, it would almost reach the difficulty levels seen in May/June.  According to previous reports, between 600,000 and 800,000 Bitcoin miners have pulled the plug on their operations in the second half of November. Market analysis firm Autonomous Research estimates that at least 100,000 individual miners have shut down, and advisory firm Fundstrat Global Advisors adds that since early September, about 1.4 million servers have been unplugged, Bloomberg reported on Monday. This flush out took the Bitcoin’s hash rate (or computing power) with it, as it is down 36% from its all-time high this September. As reported, miners are under growing pressure as the bitcoin price dropped by 80% since its all-time high in December of 2017. In November bitcoin lost 37% of its value, dropping below USD 4,000.  The CEO of China-based crypto mining pool F2Pool Shixing Mao said back in September that the break-even point for Bitcoin mining was between USD 3,891 and USD 11,581, depending on the equipment being used. At that time, BTC traded for around USD 6,400.  However, popular economist and Bitcoin investor Tuur Demeester stressed:  ""Bitcoin Mining breakeven cost"" is confusing as a general concept, because it implies a static BTC revenue per hash. However hashrate rewards adjust dynamically, via biweekly difficulty adjustment and the fee market. With the mining difficulty down as well, the remaining miners should have an easier job. However, Malachi Salcido, head of Wenatchee, one of the largest North American miners, told Bloomberg that only a select few can afford to stay in the game: miners with scale, very specific business models and extremely low electricity costs, which is the case in Douglas County where his own miners are based. Margins before costs like depreciation and taxes dropped from about 40% to 20% during the slide, but they jumped back up at the company to around 40% as smaller rivals shuttered operations, Salcido said. However, some fear a 51% attack in case some of the remaining mining companies decide to band together. The community is much more optimistic, though: they remind that the biggest ever drop of -18% back in 2011 brought to a price increase of 150% - from USD 2 to USD 5 in around 60 days.  Although many say that previous patterns are no guarantee for the future - “Just because it happened before, it does not mean it will happen again,” writes Reddit user u/Red5point1 - not all agree with that sentiment. As u/Mowglio points out, “Sure, historical data does not guarantee future results, but it is literally what all scientific analysis is based on. Throwing it to the wind as if it doesn't matter is one of the dumbest things you can do.”

" Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, remains as unknown as ever, but perhaps not so elusive after all. New posts, like one on his/hers social network P2PFoundation profile, seem to indicate that he/she has not left the world for good. But is it him/her, an impostor, or a practical joke? The first seemingly significant thing that happened in November was the appearance of a Twitter account under the handle @satoshi (now closed by Twitter), which tweeted, “I do not want to be public, but, there is an issue with SegWit. If it is not fixed, there will be nothing and I would have failed. There is only one way that Bitcoin survives and it is important to me that it works. Important enough, that I may be known openly.” The tweet appeared on November 16th - incidentally, one day after the already infamousBitcoin Cash hard fork. There had been previous tweets as well, mostly copy-pasted sentences from the Bitcoin whitepaper, as well as some numbers that are actually just plugged into formulae to calculate the probability of a successful attack on the network. The above mentioned tweet is the first one not to quote the whitepaper directly. However, the account was later suspended. Then, on November 29th, Satoshi’s P2PFoundation profile showed some activity for the first time since early 2011. First, it added a guy named Wagner Tamanaha to its friends list, and then posed a single word, “nour,” which many from the community point out means “light” in Arabic.  However, there are claims that the email used by the account is [email protected], which was allegedly hacked back in 2014. The hacking incident was first brought to light on the Bitcointalk forum, where a user claimed to have received a message from that address writing, “Michael, send me some coins before I hitman you,” and pointing out that this is not really Satoshi’s usual style. Now, this could well mean that the P2PFoundation profile was compromised as well. And that’s what most of the community seems to agree on: all of this is probably fake. Reddit user u/mr_li_jr writes, “If anyone wants to claim to be Satoshi, they can move his coins. Anything else can be faked or hacked,” and this sentiment is echoed by most of the community throughout several social networks.  It would seem that the big question behind it was never the validity of the posts, but who’s behind them and why? Most of the community readily points at Craig Wright, often dubbed Faketoshi due to his claim that he is Satoshi Nakamoto and general lack of any sort of proof. The timing of the tweet claiming that Satoshi might reveal himself is suspicious enough, as it is a day after the BCH hard fork, when it seemed that Bitcoin SV, backed by Wright, would lose the battle.  Wright’s Twitter account is a cesspool of cryptic tweets. On the same day when the @satoshi account wrote its last tweet, Wright wrote, “I have done all I can for now to warn people. I will work to make the system right, it is not you, it is not your profit, it is sound money for the world. If you cannot understand that, I cannot make you. I hope that your children will,” later adding, “About a year from now, I have something to release, but, right now, I cannot. So, the place is marked and saved, and in the time it takes, you will find what that is... when it is fixed.” Wright also wrote two tweets in Arabic around 7 hours after Satoshi’s “nour” post, both of which contain the word “light” in it. One translates to, “The light haunts the darkness,” while the other means, “The light of the world in trade.” Neither of those were subsequently explained, however.  Now the community is debating on whether the “Satoshi” accounts are controlled by Wright, or if he’s as clueless as the rest of the community but just trying to connect himself to those posts. Most believe that the latter is the case: Redditor u/HiTierChris writes, “There is a huge time difference between when Craig posted that and when that was posted from Satoshi's profile. Is there a possibility that Satoshi actually posted that and Craig saw that and now is pretending that it's him?” and u/JasonLeeH replies, “Yes, that's exactly what is happening.” However, this option also implies that if the accounts are neither owned by Satoshi or Wright, there is yet another Faketoshi in the game - Faketoshi v2.0, if you will. Maybe they’re trolling, maybe they want to spread FUD in the community, or maybe they’re just kids who are having a few laughs. Still, another unknown element in the game seriously hinders the possibility of ever discovering who Satoshi really is.  But should we discover it in the first place? Many in the community are content with letting sleeping dogs lie, while some are actively warning against demystifying the creator of the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Some even warn that it could put Satoshi in danger. Whether or not Satoshi is still alive, following the crypto market or not, or maybe even debating coming back into the spotlight, one fact remains: nobody will believe him/her until he proves he/she has access to the original Satoshi’s private key, as well as funds. Until then, listening to the FUD can only be harmful in the long run. The question remains: does it matter who Satoshi is, and would his/her reappearance really change anything?",2018-12-03
" Do you want to leave an immutable message for future generations? Then check out the Blockchainsareforever.com project. It’s not the best service for private messaging as every single message is recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, which means that they are public and can never be modified or deleted. This fun service isn’t that revolutionary, as it has been possible to add messages on the Bitcoin blockchain since its inception. For example, Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, included this message in the Genesis Block, or the first-ever block of Bitcoin: ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."" Meanwhile, this year, TD Ameritrade, an online broker, planted their literal flag on the Bitcoin’s blockchain, effectively making an advertisement for themselves. However, “Blockchains are forever” makes this much easier. Just type in your message, choose whether you want your message to show on the Bitcoin blockchain or testnet, choose your payment method (via the Lightning Network or the regular Bitcoin payment), pay, and voilá! Your message is “immortalized.” This is what people are sending into eternity: It won’t cost you a lot to try “Blockchains are forever” as sending one message is less than 5 US dollar cents. However, you are only allowed to send 80 characters in a single message. So, if you are planning to add a wall of text to the Bitcoin blockchain, be sure to stock up with BTC first. Cryptonews.com covered two similarly creative crypto projects previously. The first one is Steem Whale, which allows you to make an artificial whale fountain squirt by sending the Steem cryptocurrency.  Another fun project is Satoshi’s Place, a graffiti board to show the power and capabilities of the Lightning Network. There’re one million pixels on the canvas with each costing 1 satoshi to paint. Even if you draw something large, it won’t cost you a lot. But be aware: others can respray your art! Hower, immutability of public blockchains is being used to send serious messages, also.

" A crypto-backed exchange traded product (ETP) traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange is seeing interest from buyers, despite the year-long bear market in cryptocurrencies. On the Monday morning, it's among top 3 ETPs by performance and turnover. In comparison, on November 26, or six days after its launch, the ETP managed to reach the CHF 425,712 (USD 426,601) turnover, topping the list of ETPs. Similar to the better-known exchange traded funds (ETFs), exchange traded product (ETP) is the name given to the broader category of financial derivatives instruments that are traded on public stock exchanges. ETPs encompasses ETFs, exchange traded notes (ETNs), and various tradable certificates. The fund, named Amun Crypto ETP – with the fitting ticker code “HODL” – is designed as a weighted basket of 5 popular cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple XRP, Ether, and Litecoin, and is available for both retail investors and financial institutions. Bitcoin makes up nearly half of the fund, Ripple has around 30%, Ethereum almost 16%, and Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin each around 3%. Since going live on November 21, the ETP has seen mixed performance, in-line with the performance of the overall crypto market, which has also had a rough November. So far, the fund is down about 16% since its launch, but just like the major cryptocurrencies, it has also bounced up by more than 7% from a bottom that was reached on November 27. According to Richard Johnson, market structure expert at Greenwich Associates, a market intelligence and advisory firm, some of the interest in the HODL ETP may be due to large institutions seeking opportunities to profit from arbitrage trading between the ETP and the physical market for the underlying cryptocurrencies, The Block reported last week. How successful this arbitrage trading has been is unclear, but the persistent interest from large trading firms suggests that there is money to be made this way.  According to a Bloomberg report, trading firms Jane Street and Flow Traders provided liquidity to the ETP during its launch, and continues to actively trade it. However, both firms reportedly decline to comment on the extent of their current trading activities in the new ETP.",2018-12-03
" This past week, there was a decent rebound in bitcoin price above the USD 4,300 resistance level. However, BTC/USD failed to gain pace above USD 4,400 and declined later. The price is now back in a bearish zone and it is trading (UTC 08:30 AM) near key supports at USD 4,000 and USD 3,700. Similarly, ethereum price failed to break the major resistance at USD 125 - USD 126 and later declined. Ripple price too struggled to surpass the USD 0.400 barrier, which later resulted in a fresh decline in XRP/USD. The current market sentiment is bearish and if bitcoin price dives below USD 4,000, there could be an increase in selling pressure. Total market capitalization  After failing to trade past USD 4,400, bitcoin price  declined below the USD 4,350 and USD 4,300 support levels. BTC/USD sellers gained traction below USD 4,200 and pushed the price towards the USD 4,000 support.
The price is currently down around 4% and it is consolidating near the USD 4,000 support. If there is a downside break, the price could test the USD 3,920 support. However, the main weekly support is at USD 3,700, below which the price could trade to new yearly lows. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 4,100 followed by the weekly swing zone near USD 4,220. Ethereum price  was rejected near the USD 125 - USD 126 resistance area. Later, there was a downside correction and ETH/USD declined below the USD 115 and USD 112 support levels.
The price is currently trading above the USD 110 support, below which the price could trade towards the crucial weekly support at USD 102. On the upside, the USD 116 level is an initial resistance. However, a successful close above the USD 125 level is needed for bullish acceleration in the near term. Bitcoin cash  extended declines below the USD 200 and USD 180 support levels. BCH is currently down around 6% and it is approaching the USD 160 support. The next key support is at USD 150 followed by USD 145. BCHSV is also down around 5% and it is trading below the USD 100 support. The next major support is at USD 90, followed by USD 82.
Ripple price  failed to break the USD 0.400 resistance and declined. XRP/USD traded below the USD 0.482 and USD 0.475 supports and it is currently trading just above the USD 0.360 support level. A few small cap altcoins declined recently between 8% - 15%, including BTCP, THETA, STEEM, FCT, RVN, PPT and ICX. Out of these, BTCP is down around 13% and THETA declined close to 12%. To sum up, bitcoin price is clearly struggling to rebound with strength above USD 4,200 and USD 4,400. As long as there is no weekly close above USD 4,500, BTC/USD remains at a risk of more losses. On the downside, the main supports are USD 3,920 and USD 3,700, below which sellers may perhaps aim USD 3,400, which could increase selling pressure on altcoins like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin, eos and tron.

Total market capitalization  There was a fresh upside above the USD 4,350 resistance in bitcoin price . BTC/USD even broke the USD 4,400 resistance, but there was no proper close. As a result, the price started a downside correction and traded below the USD 4,400, USD 4,350 and USD 4,300 support levels.
The next support is at USD 4,200, below which there is a risk of an extended decline towards the USD 4,000 support. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 4,300, followed by the USD 4,400 level. A successful daily close above USD 4,400 could open the doors for more gains above USD 4,500. Ethereum price  failed to break the USD 125 - USD 126 resistance zone and started a downside move. ETH/USD declined below USD 122 and USD 120 and it is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) down more than 2%.
An initial support is at USD 115, below which the price could slide towards the USD 110 level. On the upside, buyers are likely to struggle near the USD 122, USD 125 and USD 126 resistance levels. Bitcoin cash  is down more than 4% and it broke the USD 180 support level. It seems like BCH may perhaps continue to move down and it could test the USD 170 or USD 165 support level. BCHSV moved back below the USD 100 support and it will most likely decline further towards the USD 92 or USD 90 support.
Ripple price  climbed higher towards the USD 0.400 weekly resistance where sellers emerged. XRP/USD declined and traded below the USD 0.390 and USD 0.380 support levels. The next support is at USD 0.370, below which buyers could defend USD 0.360. A few small cap altcoins gained traction and traded higher more than 8%, including CENNZ, THETA, LINK and FCT. Out of these, CENNZ is up around 14% and THETA gained nearly 13%. To sum up, bitcoin price is currently correcting lower after it failed to clear the USD 4,400 resistance level. BTC/USD may perhaps continue to correct lower, but the USD 4,000 support could stop declines. Likewise, ethereum and ripple are currently correcting lower and approaching key supports where buyers may reappear.

" North Korea, the country with one of the most feared hacker army, is reportedly targeting individual crypto owners in order to steal their coins.  According to Simon Choi, a senior researcher at the South Korean antivirus company Hauri, North Korean hackers have previously targeted crypto exchanges, but now, as direct attacks against exchanges have become harder, they are after individual digital currency users, South China Morning Post reported.  Since April 2018, the South Korean cybersecurity firm Cuvepia detected over 30 cases where North Korean hackers allegedly targeted crypto users, the company’s CEO, Kwon Seok-chul stated, according to the report. Kwon added that some cases might have gone undetected, so he estimates that the possible number of the hacks could be as high as 100. According to the report, hackers send infected email attachments with malware, so they can take over control of a crypto user’s device when the attachment is opened. Most of the victims of the recent hacks were wealthy South Korean cryptocurrency users as hackers believe that they could steal “billions” from these targets, Choi said. As mentioned, in the past, hackers were targeting crypto related institutions. For example, earlier this year, North Korean hackers had reportedly attacked an unnamed South Korean cryptocurrency exchange. The attackers tried to breach the exchange four times, but every attempt was unsuccessful. North Korea was also reportedly responsible for compromising 36,000 user accounts on the South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb and Coinis’ USD 2 million raid in 2017.  Furthermore, according to the IT security firm McAfee, North Korean hackers were behind the attack on Turkey’s financial industry and government organizations where the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities of Adobe Flash to inject malware to the victims’ computers.",2018-11-29
" Two Iranians who reportedly helped exchange Bitcoin ransom payments into Iranian rial on behalf of Iranian malicious cyber actors were caught as their Bitcoin addresses were identified by the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). This serves as an important reminder that Bitcoin is not anonymous, but pseudonymous, and that this can be used to track transactions. The money comes from the SamSam ransomware scheme, which targeted over 200 known victims, including corporations, hospitals, universities, and government agencies, in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada since 2015. The malicious actors held their victims’ data hostage in order to collect ransom, paid in bitcoin. The two identified bitcoin addresses (149w62rY42aZBox8fGcmqNsXUzSStKeq8C and 1AjZPMsnmpdK2Rv9KQNfMurTXinscVro9V) connected to this scheme have reportedly seen over 7,000 bitcoin transactions through various cryptocurrency exchanges to exchange around 6,000 BTC into Iranian rial. The OFAC clarifies, however, that not all of those funds stem from the SamSam scheme.  Supposedly, the two addresses belong to Ali Khorashadizadeh and Mohammad Ghorbaniyan, who were “central to the SamSam ransomware scheme’s success,” according to OFAC. This is also the first time that the Office publicly attributed crypto addresses to individuals, and they warn, “Regardless of whether a transaction is denominated in a digital currency or traditional fiat currency, OFAC compliance obligations are the same.” The release also adds, “As a result of today’s action, persons that engage in transactions with Khorashadizadeh and Ghorbaniyan could be subject to secondary sanctions.” Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker said, “Treasury is targeting digital currency exchangers who have enabled Iranian cyber actors to profit from extorting digital ransom payments from their victims [...] We are publishing digital currency addresses to identify illicit actors operating in the digital currency space.” The term “pseudonymity,” often used to describe Bitcoin’s modus operandi, derives from pseudonym, meaning “false name.” This means that you are simply using a fake name that can be traced back to you, as you’re not completely anonymous (“nameless”). In the original Bitcoin whitepaper, it was recommended that Bitcoin users use a new address for each transaction to avoid the transactions being linked to a common owner. However, there are still ways to trace these transactions as well. Many cryptocurrencies (so-called privacy coins) exist for the sole reason of “correcting” pseudonymity, as it is often seen as a weakness of Bitcoin, with the most popular example being Monero.  This is also not the first time that the US has cracked down on crypto criminals: only recently, a crypto trader has received 15 months of prison time for misappropriating more than USD 1.1 million worth of Bitcoin and Litecoin.",2018-11-29
" Over the course of the past few weeks, the interest of the general population in Bitcoin has seen a significant rise. Well, the interest in the Bitcoin price and whether Bitcoin is dead, to be precise.  Also, it is not popular to look for information on Bitcoin adoption or where this cryptocurrency could be spent. However, possibly the good news is that people are still more interested in buying than selling bitcoin. (Of course, those who already own cryptocurrency most likely know how to sell it, as the market crash showed.) Now, let's take a closer look at graphs.    Looking at the data from Google trends for the past three months, it seems as the number of searches for the term 'bitcoin' has more than doubled. As expected in these volatile times, the term 'bitcoin price' has also seen an increase in interest. The majority of the interest falls to African countries, with Nigeria leading the charge, followed by Ghana and South Africa. Interestingly enough, the tiny island of Saint Helena has also made the list, with a significant percentage of queries coming from the speck of land in the South Atlantic Ocean. With the recent price crash that has seen bitcoin move down from USD 6,400 mere weeks ago, another interesting term is getting more attention – 'is bitcoin dead'. Canada, the US, as well as Australia and South Africa, are most interested in this term.  Reasons as to why the sudden increase in interest is nothing but pure speculation, although it is safe to assume that it is driven mostly by high volatility and price fluctuations we’ve seen in the past few weeks. Such events draw the attention of the media, and with them – the general public. It is unlikely that it was the other way around, with interest in cryptocurrencies running the prices into the ground. However, as mentioned above, interest in buying bitcoin is still much higher than in selling or spending it. In Google's charts at least.",2018-11-28
" Argentina, which is in the middle of an escalating financial crisis, will have to wait more to get at least 150 Bitcoin ATMs, which were promised to install by the end of this year. As reported in October, the US company Odyssey Group planned to install 150 Bitcoin ATMs in the Latin American country totaling 1,600 machines by the end of 2019. Moreover, another company, Athena Bitcoin that had set up the first crypto cash point in Argentina, has also stated that it expects to have a total of 30 machines in the country by the end of 2018. However, it seems that the country won’t see dozens of new Bitcoin ATMs anytime soon. Odyssey Group has postponed its plans and now estimates to enter the market during the next six months, the Next Web reported, citing CEO Sebastian Ponceliz. According to the report, he claims that the reason for postponing Argentina’s Bitcoin ATM upgrade is due to the central bank of the country and the organization’s local market partners that allegedly asked the company to adjust “all the legal and technical requirements” that were “demanded” by the aforementioned parties. However, the report stressed that the company has previously made multiple promises that have yet to come true. In September 2017, the subsidiary of the company, Octagon, planned to install 250 crypto ATMs in Buenos Aires by October. While in May 2018, Ponceliz announced that his company had reached an agreement with Argentina’s central bank to roll out 4,000 machines. Moreover, in the same interview, the CEO claimed that 200 ATMs had been set up in the Latin American country. But that did not happen, according to Coin ATM Radar that shows only four working crypto cash points in the country, all installed by Athena. At press time, Athena did not respond to a request for comment. Bitcoin ATMs in Buenos Aires: ____ Meanwhile, the Argentinian Peso has been in a great decline since the start of this year.  ARS / USD rate: However, the fact that fiat currencies tend to be more volatile in Latin America brings ""a tremendous opportunity for adoption across the region,"" according to some investors. For example, OKGroup, the owner of the major crypto-to-crypto exchange OKEx, has entered the region via its fiat-to-crypto exchange OKCoin, which offers its services in more than 110 countries. “As the value of Argentina’s fiat currency remains uncertain, our hope is that we can help bring some stability to the country’s economy by providing Argentines with an array of cryptocurrency options,"" OKCoin’s Latin American representative, Pablo Magro, told Cryptonews.com earlier in November.

" After the past few days of heavy selling, crypto markets are again in the green across the board today. All top 20 coins are seeing gains on Wednesday. It seems that buyers once again has hit the markets, after selling has brought prices of most coins down to levels that some would consider “cheap” again. This comes at the same time as a range of positive news developments have been revealed regarding the much-anticipated institutional entry into crypto.  Let’s go through them one by one: Nasdaq, the second-largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization, aims to allow Bitcoin futures trading in the first quarter of 2019, despite the market crash this year, Bloomberg reported, citing “two people familiar with the matter.”  The Nasdaq futures will be based off the Bitcoin’s price on numerous spot exchanges, as compiled by VanEck Associates Corp., according to the report. This comment was uttered by Jeffrey Sprecher, the founder and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) when asked about the recent decline in bitcoin prices during the CoinDesk’s Consensus conference in New York on Tuesday. ICE is the parent company and an important backer of the new Bakkt platform, which is widely expected to bring more institutional liquidity into the bitcoin market.  Sprecher was joined on stage by Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler, who echoed the same sentiment by saying “the price is being expressed but there’s a lot of missing infrastructure and use cases,” thus suggesting that prices may recover once the “missing infrastructure” is put in place, according to Coindesk. However, as reported, the launch date of the Bakkt platform will be pushed back to January 24, 2019, from an originally scheduled release in December of this year.  The retail investors in crypto are becoming more reasonable, while institutions are starting to establish a foothold for the long-term, Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at insurance and investment giant Allianz said during the same conference on Tuesday. The highly regarded economist further said that he believes cryptocurrencies “will exist,” and that they will become “more and more widespread,” Reuters reported. However, he also added a word of caution to some of the most outspoken crypto enthusiasts, saying “[cryptocurrencies] will not be [as] dominant as some of the early adopters believed them to be.” Meanwhile, at the same conference, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton reiterated the SEC’s stance that bitcoin is not a security. “An asset like bitcoin, where it’s designed to be a replacement for sovereign currencies, we’ve determined that doesn’t have the attributes of a security,” Clayton said, according to Yahoo Finance. However, when it came to the much-anticipated bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF), Clayton’s comments were not so positive. On the issue of a potential ETF approval, Clayton explained that whatever asset an ETF is based on must be “free from the risk of manipulation.” He added that this is “an issue that needs to be addressed before I would be comfortable [with approving a bitcoin ETF].” And it looks like the crypto industry is trying to address these issues. In the US, a new crypto association has emerged that aims to establish a Code of Conduct for emerging digital asset markets.  Ten financial services and technology firms, including Galaxy Digital, Paxos, Genesis Global Trading among others, launched the Association for Digital Asset Markets (ADAM.) It will will work with current and former regulators to provide rules for the efficient trading, custody, clearing and settlement of digital assets, according to the announcement. ADAM’s Code of Conduct will include guidelines for market integrity, risk management, KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti-money laundering), custody, record keeping, clearing and settlement, market manipulation, data protection, and research, among other topics.",2018-11-28
" A module called event-stream, used in millions of web applications but notably in BitPay’s open-source Bitcoin wallet Copay has reportedly been compromised, potentially leaving some other wallets vulnerable as well.  BitPay published an advisory saying Copay versions 5.0.2 through 5.1.0 were affected by the malicious code and that users with these versions installed should avoid running or opening the app until they install Copay version 5.2.0. “Our team is continuing to investigate this issue and the extent of the vulnerability,” the official announcement reads. “Currently, we have only confirmed that the malicious code was deployed on versions 5.0.2 through 5.1.0 of our Copay and BitPay apps. However, the BitPay app was not vulnerable to the malicious code. We are still investigating whether this code vulnerability was ever exploited against Copay users.” Copay, the affected wallet, has more than 100,000 downloads of Android, while the number of users from other platforms like iOS or Windows is unknown. Any other wallets using this module might be affected as well, although as of the time of writing, none of them have come forward.  The problem stems from a GitHub user volunteering to take over the library in question, inject malware and patch it up to avoid detection. The user, known only as “right9ctrl,” took over maintenance of the module from its original creator, developer Dominic Tarr, who said that he had not maintained the repository in years. In short, the developer updated the module with malware and then hid it from view, but the numerous people who had already installed it remain affected. Well known developer Jameson Lopp explained:  The npm ""event-stream"" repository has been compromised; if you are using it in a project along with ""copay-dash"" then the malware will steal any private keys it can find. https://t.co/fAnH6ik1n9 ___
Jackson Palmer, an Australian entrepreneur and technologist best known for creating the infamously successful ""joke"" cryptocurrency Dogecoin, added: This is one of the major issues with JavaScript-based cryptocurrency wallets with heavy up-stream dependencies coming from NPM. @BitPay essentially trusted all the up-stream developers to never inject malicious code into their wallet.@dominictarr also let the attacker in, sadly Event-stream is downloaded roughly two million times a week by application programmers for many different uses. The version with the malware in it, Event-Stream v 3.3.6, was published on September 9 via Node Package Manager (NPM) repository, and had since been downloaded by nearly 8 million application programmers.  The malicious code supposedly attempted to steal digital coins stored in the Dash Copay Bitcoin wallets - distributed through the NPM - and transfer them to a server located in Kuala Lumpur. Officials from NPM removed the backdoor from NPM's listing on Monday this week.",2018-11-27
" Bitcoin price started a short term correction recently after a drop below USD 3,800. BTC/USD corrected above USD 4,000 and USD 4,100, but it struggled to clear the USD 4,200 barrier. Later, the price declined again and settled below USD 4,000, which is a bearish sign. Similarly, ethereum price failed to break an important resistance near USD 120 and started a fresh downward move. Ripple price also struggled to gain traction above USD 0.400, resulting in bearish moves. Going forward, if bitcoin and altcoins struggle to break key pivot levels, there could be yet another bearish wave below recent lows in the near term. Total market capitalization  Recently, there was a recovery above the USD 4,000 resistance in bitcoin price , but buyers struggled to retain strength. BTC/USD topped near the USD 4,200 level and started a fresh downward move. It broke the USD 4,000 and USD 3,800 levels to move back in a bearish zone.
The price is down around 6% (UTC 08:30 AM) and it seems like it could decline further below the USD 3,750 and USD 3,620 support levels. In the worst case scenario, the price may even break the recent low and trade below the USD 3,500 level. Ethereum price  recovered more than USD 15, but it struggled near a crucial resistance at USD 120. ETH/USD faced a solid selling interest near USD 120, which resulted in a bearish reaction.
The price declined below USD 115 and USD 110 and it is currently down around 6%. An immediate support is at USD 105, below which there is a risk of a downside break below the key USD 100 support. The main resistances on the upside are at USD 115 and USD 120. Bitcoin cash  ABC rallied above the USD 200 and USD 220 resistance levels. However, BCHABC failed to stay above USD 200 and later declined heavily. The price is currently trading near USD 180 and it seems like it could test the USD 170 support. On the other hand, BCHSV rallied above the USD 100 level and traded as high as USD 140. It is currently consolidating above USD 100 with positive moves.
Ripple price  recovered above the USD 0.385 resistance, but it struggled to clear the USD 0.400 resistance. XRP/USD is down 5% to USD 0.358 and it could revisit the USD 0.340 support. Many small cap altcoins declined recently more than 10%, including SRN, FCT, MITH, STEEM, ONT, MAID, REP, WAN, GNT and ODE. Out of these, SRN declined around 26% and FCT is down nearly 25%. Overall, bitcoin price is back below the key USD 4,000 support, which is a bearish sign. If BTC/USD fails to jump above USD 4,000 and USD 4,200, there is a risk of more losses below the USD 3,500 level in the near term. Similarly, there could be an increase in selling pressure on altcoins like ethereum, ripple, BCH, neo and litecoin if they fail to start a fresh rebound in the next few hours.

" The current cryptocurrency price crash is taking its toll on miners in China and Russia, with media outlets in both countries reporting mass shutdowns and equipment sell-offs. However, some experts in both countries believe that fresh opportunities may well arise following the market panic. Some are sensing a possible upside, and are choosing to stay in the game. Chinese media outlet Caixin quotes the COO of Chinese company Mining Sea, which operates farms in Yunnan, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia as stating, “We have yet to switch off our machines as we also offer financial products to help clients control for such risks.” The COO also stated miners could possibly “acquire more coins” now as rivals “have temporarily stopped running their machines.” And Russian media outlet Kommersant quotes the co-founder of the ICG cryptocurrency fund as stating that although “the Russian home miner is gradually disappearing,” big businesses in the country are ready to step in with superior technology – perhaps leading to a second boom in mining. However, for many it's still a challenging period and bitcoin miners are increasingly feeling the pressure to sell their coins.  Caixin quotes a mining industry insider as stating that some miners in the country have “halted operations” as Bitcoin prices have dropped below “shutdown price,” the level below which mining effectively ceases to be profitable. F2pool, one of the largest mining pools in China, stated that Bitcoin prices had dropped below shutdown price for miners paying USD 0.05/KwH for electricity and using Bitmain’s Antminer S7, Avalon’s Miner A741 and the lower-frequency version of the USED Whatsminer M3+. F2pool officials  also claimed, earlier this week, that between 600,000 and 800,000 Bitcoin miners have pulled the plug on their operations in the past two weeks. Meanwhile, in Russia, Kommersant quotes the co-founder of mining farm operator and hardware maker RMC as stating mining farm facilities had “temporarily suspended activities at the request of project participants, as the cost of electricity currently exceeds the income made from mining.” The company says it will push ahead, however, with plans to build parts for new altcoin mining hardware. Marketplace app Youla, Russia’s answer to eBay, has reported a 25% rise in the amount of mining equipment listings, as well as “a simultaneous drop” in bid prices, for both ready-made mining rigs and video cards. Youla noted that the terms “mining” and “Bitcoin” were now being searched for four times less often than at the beginning of the year – when Russia was in the grip of its mining boom.

" After a dark red weekend in the crypto market, both bitcoin and major altcoins rebounded strongly on Sunday and Monday morning. Over the past 24 hours (UTC 07:10 AM), bitcoin has shot up more than 8% from its weekend lows below the USD 3,500 level. From a technical analysis-perspective, bitcoin and other major coins now appear to have found some support around levels established all the way back in September 2017. The question, however, is whether this level will hold, or if the market needs to search even lower to find a bottom. Top 10 coins (UTC 07:10 AM): Following the massive decline in the size of the cryptocurrency market, the market capitalization of the entire crypto market has now shrunk to around USD 130 billion, from a peak of 822 billion in January this year.  Therefore, more than 50 of the largest publicly traded companies in the world now have market cap’s that are larger than the entire crypto market. This includes all of the famous tech companies – the so-called FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) group of stocks – but also many smaller companies like McDonald’s, Walt Disney, and MasterCard. Among the biggest losers during the recent wave of crypto selling has been Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which was hit hard by the internal fighting between the Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV camps. The dust in that battle now seems to have settled with Bitcoin ABC emerging as the winner, but it has nonetheless caused heavy losses in the BCH price, as it fell from over USD 380 a week ago to just USD 167 as of press time. Bitcoin Cash also briefly lost its number 4 spot to EOS, although this has been reversed Monday morning. Although the market seems to have found at least some support for now, volatility may be coming back to bitcoin soon. On Friday (Nov 30), bitcoin futures on the CME Group exchange are set to expire – a monthly occasion which some suggest have caused bitcoin sell-offs in the past. However, the link between bitcoin futures expiries and sell-offs – or rallies – in the “physical” bitcoin market is highly uncertain, and the last year has shown that other futures expiry dates have been rather uneventful in the bitcoin market.",2018-11-26
" Businesses in America’s Ohio have been given the green light to pay their tax bills in cryptocurrencies, says the state’s treasurer. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, treasurer Josh Mandel explained that as of November 26 companies throughout the state could register and pay for a whole range of taxes via the OhioCrypto platform, using Bitcoin. The treasurer is quoted as stating, “I see [Bitcoin] as a legitimate form of currency.” Per the Wall Street Journal’s report, the state’s platform also hopes to begin accepting other cryptocurrencies, and hopes to allow “eventually” individuals in Ohio to pay taxes using the platform. A number of other American states have launched similar bids, including Illinois, Arizona and Georgia, but none have yet succeeded in persuading local legislatures to accept proposals. The OhioCrypto platform appears to be the brainchild of BitPay, an Atlanta-based third-party blockchain payment service. For its part, BitPay appears to be optimistic about the future of Bitcoin, despite massive price drops in recent days. Meanwhile, BitPay's chief operating officer Sonny Singh last week told Bloomberg he was confident that Bitcoin prices would bounce back in 2019, hitting all-time highs. Singh stated, “By the end of Q1 or Q2, Bitcoin will emerge as a viable commodity.” He also said that an influx of “new players and miners engaging in the industry” would help drive a new price surge. Meanwhile, a museum in the state has also begun allowing cryptocurrency payments. As of earlier this month, visitors to the Great Lakes Science Center in Cleveland can pay for admission in Bitcoin.

" With bitcoin losing more than 30% of its value over the last week and a half alone, bitcoin miners are increasingly feeling the pressure as well. At USD 4,300, bitcoin is now at the lowest level seen since October 2017. Value of created bitcoins: ""Pretty concerning for small-time miners like me... Thankfully, I get extremely cheap power but it's hard to compete with economies of scale when some miners can buy hundreds of ASICs at a time,"" Reddit user PragmaticPleb wrote in a thread. ""I’m still running but the margins are thin and I might have to come out of pocket to cover some costs if the price drops even more. We’ll just have to do our best to weather this bear market and hopefully we can come out on the other side when the price begins to recover,"" IGotThisYo replied. Some large mining firms are already throwing in the towel. On Wednesday, it was reported that US-based mining form Giga Watt had filed for bankruptcy in Washington, still owing creditors nearly USD 7 million. According to another article by the South China Morning Post on Thursday, the China-based mining pool F2Pool now estimates that a range of mining machines, including the Antminer S7, S9, and AvalonMiner 741, has now become unprofitable to operate in China, leading to a flood of these machines being put up for sale on the second-hand market. Some, however, see opportunities when others are suffering. According to the same article, a miner by the name Jack Liao of the Shenzhen, China-based bitcoin mining firm Lightning Asic, has taken advantage of the slump to buy up second-hand mining machines at bargain prices. Liao told the newspaper that he has bought up about 50,000 mining machines, most of which are Antminer S9s, for about USD 70 each. A new S9 machine goes for around USD 300 from Bitmain’s website. Moreover, according to Nikkei, China's Bitmain Technologies Holding and Ebang International Holding, the two largest bitcoin mining equipment makers in the world, are widely expected to follow peers in delaying planned floats on the Hong Kong stock market, analysts warn, as regulatory headwinds and market volatility have disrupted plans by crypto-related companies to sell shares. As WhalePanda, an angel investor and bitcoin enthusiast, posted to Twitter, the losses that miners have suffered are already visible on the bitcoin hash rate: It will become easier to mine Bitcoin which of course benefits the miners who don't have to sell immediately since they can more easily stock up on $BTC and just wait out the bear market. Not every miner can do this though since (electricity) bills need to get paid. pic.twitter.com/t8ui3vznlP As a result, the difficulty rate of bitcoin mining has also begun to decline as more and more miners are switching off their machines. The difficulty has already declined two times this year, and it is likely that the next adjustment will bring the difficulty rate even lower. Moreover, it looks like the Bitcoin blockchain is also adding blocks at a slower rate than usual. Another casualty of the bear market: Bitcoin's inter-blocktime is actually getting longer. As hashpower comes offline, difficulty isn't reducing fast enough to cope, and Bitcoin is adding blocks at a slower rate than usual.https://t.co/IuY5cLP5zp pic.twitter.com/WPIg1sTkTR Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at online crypto and foreign exchange brokerage eToro, echoed the same sentiment, saying “miners are shutting down their rigs.” Bitcoin hashrate is now the lowest it's been since August. It's still up sharply since the start of the year but it seems clear that some miners are shutting down their rigs in face of lower BTC prices. pic.twitter.com/Og9AJM6FGt And since today is “Black Friday,” more or less desperate cloud mining companies, including the well-known Genesis Mining, are trying to push their mining contracts to new customers at discounted prices. However, as can be seen from the replies on Twitter, the community is not exactly impressed by the offering. 2/2 expire quicker and quicker, save your money and actually buy bitcoin then just HODL!",2018-11-23
" French fintech company Keplerk has just made it possible for tobacco shop customers in France to buy bitcoins. The initiative affects 24,000 tobacco shops in the country where bitcoins will be offered as vouchers, which can be cashed in via Keplerk’s wallet. The company will take a 7% cut on every transaction as commission fees. “Tobacco shop owners are the best channel as they are trusted by customers, and they are used to sell vouchers such as credit for mobile phones,” Adil Zakhar, Keplerk’s director for strategy and development, was quoted as saying by Reuters. According to the Bank of France, the monetary authority will not supervise Keplerk’s project, but the institution has warned French citizens about the risks of buying cryptocurrencies. “Those are purely speculative assets and not currencies. Those who invest in bitcoin or other crypto-assets do it at their own risk,” the central bank said on November 21, 2018. Meanwhile, in March 2018, Cryptonews.com reported a similar event in Australia. From that date, Aussie crypto enthusiasts are able to purchase bitcoin and ether at 1,200 newsstands in the Oceanic country. The adoption was facilitated by the Australian cryptocurrency exchange Bitcoin.com.au.  Also, in July 2017, the Austrian startup BitPanda has partnered with the country’s postal service, the Österreichische Post, to offer cryptocurrency vouchers - including bitcoin, ether, litecoin, and dash - to the citizens of the European country.

" The past three sessions were mostly neutral as there were range moves above the USD 4,400 and USD 4,500 support levels in bitcoin price. BTC/USD rebounded a few points, but it struggled to break the USD 4,750 and USD 4,800 resistance levels. Similarly, there was a minor upside correction in ethereum price above the USD 130 and USD 132 levels. However, buyers failed to push the price above the USD 140 and 145 resistance levels. The current price action is positive and it seems like major cryptocurrencies could consolidate above supports in the short term before the next move.  Total market capitalization  There was a decent upward move above the USD 4,600 level in bitcoin price . BTC/USD even traded above the USD 4,700 level. However, the price failed to surpass the USD 4,750 and USD 4,800 resistance levels. It is currently consolidating near USD 4,600 with a few positive moves.
On the downside, a break below USD 4,600 may push the price towards the USD 4,500 support area. The main support for the current wave is near USD 4,400, which is the lower end of the range. On the upside, a successful break above USD 4,750 and USD 4,800 is needed for buyers to gain bullish momentum in the near term. Ethereum price  managed to move above the USD 130 and USD 132 resistance levels. ETH/USD also traded above the USD 135 level, but it faced a strong resistance near the USD 140 - USD 142 area.
The price is currently trading in a range above the USD 132 level, below which the price could drop back towards the USD 125 support. On the upside, a successful break above USD 142 and USD 150 is needed for more gains. Bitcoin cash  ABC failed to stay above the USD 250 support and declined more than 4%. BCHABC is currently trading near USD 230, with an immediate support at USD 220. BCHSV declined sharply by more than 7% and traded below the USD 62 and 60 support levels. The next key support is at USD 55 and USD 50.
Ripple price  seems to be struggling to stay above the USD 0.450 and USD 0.460 levels. XRP/USD is down 2.2% and it could continue to correct lower towards the USD 0.435 support. A few small cap altcoins recovered between 8%-15% today, including NEXO, LRC, GNT, SNT, XIN, PIVX, MANA, REP and BAT. Out of these, NEXO climbed around 15% and LRC moved up close to 13%. To sum up, bitcoin price is trading with a short term positive bias above the USD 4,400 support. If BTC/USD manages to climb above the USD 4,750 and USD 4,800 resistance levels, there could be a decent rebound in the coming sessions. If not, there are chances of a fresh bearish wave in bitcoin and altcoins in the near term.

" As the crypto sell-off is hitting mainstream media outlets, experts are being brought on to explain what is going on in the crypto markets, as well as share their thought on just how deep the rabbit hole is. In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Sonny Singh, chief commercial officer of the major bitcoin payment service provider BitPay, said that the bitcoin price, in his view, will not do much at all until there is a new catalyst to drive the market either higher or lower. According to Singh, such a catalyst could be Fidelity launching its much-anticipated crypto product, or “Bakkt launching their product, or Square launching their product, or Blackrock launching an ETF […]” However, “until such products come out,” Singh explained, “I don’t think there is much of a market catalyst moving bitcoin either way.” In either case, according to him, “Bitpay will process over a billion dollars again this year, even though the price of bitcoin has dropped 75%, because people are actually using bitcoin, whether it is as a store of value, a payment transact…There’s just different use-cases for it all over the world.” In conclusion, Singh said that he expects the bitcoin price to trade somewhere around USD 15,000 to USD 20,000 by the end of next year, as long as some of the “traditional companies” mentioned do launch their products. However, he added a word of caution, saying that “nothing moves fast in fin-tech.” Watch the entire Bloomberg interview with BitPay’s chief commercial officer Sonny Singh below: In a separate interview on the Bloomberg Markets podcast on Wednesday, chairman of London-based crypto asset management company CoinShares, Danny Masters, shared his insights on the current state of the crypto market and the new trend of so-called stablecoins in particular. When asked about his opinion on stablecoins, Masters said that the idea of “switching from volatile crypto assets to stable dollars, while remaining within this electronic environment […] is quite appealing.” “It’s an interesting development,” he said, while adding that “certainly there is demand for that digital dollar.”  Asked about the recent sell-off in the crypto markets, Masters admitted that it has been difficult for his company, saying “it’s certainly been a challenging week in the bitcoin space.” However, he also pointed out that when global stock markets first started to become more volatile a month ago, “bitcoin remained stable.” In the current phase, “the bears in bitcoin have definitely scored a win,” Masters said, while adding that as someone who has been around for a while “one tries not to become too excited when it goes up, and not too disappointed when it goes down.” Meanwhile, Lou Kerner, partner at CryptoOracle, an advisory and investment firm, told CNBC that ""If you go back to the internet bubble, which is what a lot of us in crypto look at for direction, Amazon, arguably one of the greatest companies in the history of the mankind, was down over 95% over two years.""",2018-11-22
" Members of the crypto community are obviously not pleased with the news that the much-anticipated Bakkt futures trading platform may not come as soon as the market has been hoping for. Despite the importance of the Bakkt futures launch might be overestimated, the news trimmed Bitcoin’s gains yesterday.  Bitcoin price chart: ___ The community reacted: Thanks for stabbing bitcoin in the @BakkT ____ Tell that to my hungry kids. Shame on you Kelly! pic.twitter.com/Sclt2sQIFN Others blamed the news for the heavy sell-off in the crypto market over the past few days: Explains why the market tanked. Insiders knew before the rest of us.  I’m nvr selling btw! ____ This means they think we will hit bottom near end of January. ____ Whatever the reason for the delay may be, some speculate that it has more to do with low liquidity and little trading interest in the futures market, rather than “the volume of interest in Bakkt.” Speaking about the size of the bitcoin futures market back in August, Chris Concannon, president and chief operating officer of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) told Bloomberg: “I’ve learned that there’s been more articles than volume. It’s a little bit shocking to me the attention this market gets versus its size. The entire crypto market is a fifth of Apple.” CBOE and CME, an American financial market company operating an options and futures exchange, combined traded about 9,000 contracts a day in the third quarter, according to Bloomberg data. Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the University of Houston and an expert on futures trading, stressed in October that “Institutional players have stayed on the Bitcoin sidelines, and as long as they are, the futures contracts are likely not to generate substantial amounts of volume.”  Bakkt made a splash in the crypto world when it was first announced back in August, with the support of well-known brand names like Microsoft, BCG, and Starbucks. It was set up by the New York-based Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), and aims to offer 1-day physically settled bitcoin futures for institutional clients from its base in the US. Many in the crypto community have expressed great hopes that the company can help boost institutional interest in cryptocurrency, and possibly be a catalyst for the next wave of buying in the market. Now, according to the new update from Bakkt’s CEO Kelly Loeffler, the launch date of the institutional-grade trading and “warehousing” platform will be pushed back to January 24, 2019, from an originally scheduled release in December of this year. The new release date is still subject to regulatory approvals, and the company promises to keep the community updated on progress and relevant milestones as the launch approaches. “Given the volume of interest in Bakkt and work required to get all of the pieces in place, we will now be targeting January 24, 2019 for our launch to ensure that our participants are ready to trade on Day 1,” Loeffler wrote in the statement. Whether the recent market crash has something to do with Bakkt is currently one of the popular topics in the community, and many are joking that traditional investors want to “buy the dip.” “When retail investors miss the train, they miss the train. When institutions miss the train, they bring the train back,” Reddit user u/Subfolded quoted a Wall Street saying. This seems to be the general consensus: that the prices are being manipulated by whales that want institutional investors to enter the market below its real value. However, there is also a smaller group of people that just don’t see it: u/McDonald5 sarcastically writes, “Get your tin foil hat ready, it's a CONSPIRACY!” The first group, meanwhile, is the significantly louder one. “Bitcoin was very stable over the last few month but suddenly right before ETFs and BAKKT, everything drops. It’s only my opinion but a lot of money can enter with ETFs and a drop just doesn’t make sense. Normally we get pumps from news like this and dumps when it’s released. This time I feel like somebody is making sure opposite happens,” writes u/toohottoospicy.  u/Raymikqwer replies, “I feel like the majority of Reddit seems to think everything is conspiracy involving whales or some other nonsense. There’s always the possibility that everything was just MASSIVELY overbought in December/January and it’s still correcting to a price the market deems as fair.”",2018-11-21
" As the overall crypto market is seeing a another huge wave of selling, all top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are down by more than 70% from their all-time highs (ATH) (well, except stablecoins.) Since its all-time high in December 2017, bitcoin is now down nearly 77%, ether - 90%, ripple - 88%, litecoin - 91%, according to OnChainFX data.  Now, the price of the number one cryptocurrency, bitcoin, is down 15% over the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, the only coins in the top 100 that are in the green are a couple of USD-pegged stablecoins, with many major coins being down between 10% and 20%. Top 10 coins: (UTC 06:40 AM) The losses overnight follow a similar sell-off from Wednesday last week, when bitcoin also shredded off more than 10%. As has been the trend over the past few days, Ripple’s XRP has held up great in the sea of red numbers with a 24 hour decline of just below 1%. According to some commentators, Ripple may be getting some of its stability from being a very different cryptocurrency, as it aims to work within the current banking system rather than replacing it. 
UPDATED (UTC 09:20) Ripple price was stable earlier during the day, but later buyers gave up and sellers took control below the USD 0.460 support.  Another possible explanation is that the drama following the Bitcoin Cash split has affected the rest of the crypto space, and in particular other proof-of-work-based assets like bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash was one of the hardest-hit coins last night, falling more than 40%. As the crypto market hits rock bottom once again, some still see opportunities in the space. According to Spencer Bogart, partner at the crypto-focused investment firm Blockchain Capital, there is still a “gigantic” opportunity in the crypto space, and in particular in projects that are related to bitcoin, or “programmable money,” as Bogart calls it. “I still believe that programmable money in a multi-trillion-dollar idea. Right now, we’re in a bear market, but we’re coming off one of the biggest bull markets of all time,” Bogart told Bloomberg on Monday. Meanwhile, Stephen Palley, Anderson Kill partner, reacts to Bitcoin tumbling below the USD 5,000 mark by saying he doesn't see a connection or causal relationship between recent SEC (The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) activity and the price of cryptocurrency. At the same time, the cryptoverse met another crash with emotions, attempts of inspiration, insights and jokes, of course.

" After Tom Lee, a popular crypto analyst, cut his Bitcoin price forecast for this year to USD 15,000, the cryptoverse is still not convinced that the price might triple in less than two months. According to Lee, the level at which mining costs match the trading price is down to USD 7,000 from an earlier estimate of USD 8,000 for the S9 mining machine by Bitmain, CNBC reported last Friday. The head of Fundstrat Global Advisors, a market analyst company, estimates that fair value for bitcoin would be roughly 2.2 times the new USD 7,000 break-even price, therefore Bitcoin should stand at around USD 15,000. Less than a month ago, he was convinced that Bitcoin could still surpass USD 20,000 - even in spite of the almost year-long bear market.  Bitcoin price chart: The analyst also stressed that the recent drop in the market led to a renewed wave of pessimism: “We believe the negative swing in sentiment is much worse than the fundamental implications”. However, according to Lee, a price recovery is possible. He believes that the wave of institutions (Bakkt, Fidelity) - that are expected to enter the market at the end of 2018 - could bring Bitcoin bulls back.  Meanwhile, Sven Henrich, founder of NorthmanTrader, a market analysis firm, published this chart that compares Lee's predictions and Bitcoin price: (Click on Henrich's tweet to see the whole chart below.) Henrich’s followers on Twitter reacted:  Year end $15k???? That’s almost a triple in 6 weeks. Other members of the cryptoverse have also offered their opinion:  pic.twitter.com/36BKDs8C8e Back in 2017, Lee stated that he believes “Bitcoin is your best investment until the end of the year.” According to him, people see Bitcoin as the older generations have been seeing gold in the 1980s: a hedge against fiat currencies. If Bitcoin captures the ""5% of just the gold market, it's USD 25,000. But 5% seems like an awfully small number. Let's say it's 10 or 15. Then bitcoin could easily be in the USD 100,000 range,” he said back then.",2018-11-19
" This past week, we saw heavy declines in bitcoin below the USD 6,000 support area. BTC/USD remained in a bearish zone and opened with a negative tone this week. The price recently broke the USD 5,500 support and traded to a new 2018 low. Similarly, ethereum was under a lot of selling pressure as it broke the USD 175 support. It is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) down more than 10% and it seems like sellers are in control below USD 160. Both BCHABC and BCHSV declined heavily below the USD 250 and USD 100 supports respectively. The current market sentiment is clearly bearish and it seems like bitcoin could extend declines towards USD 5,000 in the coming sessions. Total market capitalization  There were heavy bearish moves below the USD 5,600 level in bitcoin price . BTC/USD traded below the USD 5,550 and USD 5,400 support levels recently to move further into a bearish zone. A new 2018 high was formed near USD 5,300 and it seems like the price could continue to move down in the near term.
The main weekly support level is at USD 5,000, below which there is an open space up to USD 4,400. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 5,500, above which the price could recover towards the USD 5,750 level. The key weekly resistance is at USD 6,000, which was a crucial support earlier. Ethereum price  fell during the past few hours and declined below the USD 170 and USD 160 support levels. ETH/USD is currently down around 13% to USD 155.
An immediate support is at USD 150, below which the price could tumble towards the USD 130 level. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 170, above which the price could test USD 180. The main weekly hurdle for buyers is near the USD 195 level. Both Bitcoin cash  coins are down significantly. BCHABC is down around 15% and it recently traded below the USD 250 support. The next major support for buyers is near the USD 200 level. BCHSV collapsed and declined roughly 30% to USD 90. If it continues to decline, it could test the USD 80 level in the near term.
Ripple price  recovered recently, but buyers failed to hold gains above the USD 0.520 and USD 0.505 levels. XRP/USD followed bitcoin’s path and declined around 5%. It is currently trading near USD 0.475 and it could test the USD 0.450 level. Many altcoins declined heavily and registered losses between 15%-20%, including LRC, ICX, WAN, AION, ELF, SRN, VET, IOST and MKR. Out of these, LRC is down 18% and ICX declined 17%. To sum up, bitcoin and altcoins moved further into the red zone. BTC/USD may perhaps continue to decline towards USD 5,000 and if buyers fail to defend more losses, the price could tumble. Similarly, ethereum must stay above the USD 150 level to avoid a drop towards the USD 130 and USD 125 levels in the near future.

" “Big four” accounting firm KPMG says that assets like Bitcoin are not truly currencies yet, but that “a new world of finance is emerging in which transacting in cryptoassets may become standard procedure.” To drive the space towards this new world, they believe that institutionalization is necessary in order to “build trust, facilitate scale, increase accessibility, and drive growth.” The paper, titled Institutionalization of Cryptocurrencies, covers the challenges facing the cryptocurrency industry, as it seeks adoption by the world’s largest financial institutions. They define institutionalization as the at-scale participation in the cryptocurrency market of banks, broker dealers, exchanges, payment providers, fintech companies, and other entities in the global financial services ecosystem. ""New tokens and assets are one thing, but new business models and market participants may redefine the space significantly over the next few years,"" according to KPMG. For Bitcoin and other assets to “truly become a currency,” KPMG believes that there will be three criteria to be met: being used as a unit of account, a store of value, and a unit of exchange. While it may meet the requirement of a “unit of account” to a certain extent, KPMG chief economist Constance Hunter believes that the assets are too unstable to be considered a store of value. “Consider for a moment extending a person or entity a loan in a cryptocurrency. The value is too unstable at the moment to be assured repayment. Under these conditions, neither lenders nor borrowers would be willing to take the risk of transacting in cryptocurrencies,” she explains. As for the final qualification - unit of exchange - Hunter adds, “In order to be a medium of exchange, a crypto must be a store of value. In order to be a store of value, the speculative nature of crypto must dissipate. Until at least one crypto meets all three criteria, they cannot be considered full currencies.” But once cryptocurrencies meet all three of these criteria, the financial world as we know it might well change. “If a crypto could achieve enough stability of value to be used for this purpose, it could eliminate the need to have bank accounts in multiple countries and could allow individuals to transfer money to anyone without paying wire fees. If a fully equipped crypto that has a stable value becomes easier and less expensive to transact than a government-issued fiat currency, it could be an innovation that becomes ubiquitous in the global financial services system,” Hunter believes. However, up until now, companies that have looked towards institutionalization have often faced immediate backlash from the community. One example is peer-to-peer crypto trading platform ShapeShift, which has announced mandatory KYC (know your customer) to be implemented very soon - to the disgruntlement of Bitcoin maximalists, who believed that this platform was one of the few remaining ones following “Satoshi’s vision.” Another recent example are stablecoins which have backdoors to allow them to freeze assets and blacklist addresses at will. Whether these companies will truly achieve mass adoption thanks to institutionalization still remains to be seen.",2018-11-16
" USD 5,500 per bitcoin is a good entry point for those willing to buy this most popular cryptocurrency, Jehan Chu, founder of Kenetic Capital, a blockchain investment and advisory firm, said. They have recently revealed that their proprietary investment portfolio has recorded year-to-date returns of 77% against the highly bearish market. Talking on Bloomberg Daybreak Asia, Jehan Chu said, “I bought my first Bitcoin at USD 900 back in late 2013, and I continued buying all the way down to USD 200. Those of us who have been early in the space have seen this before, so do I think that USD 5,500 down from a high from around USD 18,000-19,000 is a good entry point? I do. [...] As we move forward, Bitcoin and some of the larger cap cryptocurrencies will increasingly be seen as a legitimate store of value, especially in the wake of what’s happening across the globe. And I think that USD 5,500 in a year will be seen as a very cheap price.” Forecasts coming from companies that have managed to record high returns might be worth to listen, especially given that the whole market is down around 65% compared to December 2017. (In either case, it's a healthy thing to take all forecasts with a grain of salt. For example, in December 2017, even Jehan Chu estimated that Bitcoin will reach USD 50,000 by the end of 2018 and confirmed this forecast in January.)  The return of 77% is recorded as of October 31st, with two more months until the end of the year. Kenetic Capital CEO Daniel Weinberg explains, “During this volatile period, our proprietary investment portfolio continued to outperform many crypto funds as a result of our deep institutional investment experience and strong risk management.” As to whether Bitcoin can go back to where it was around a year ago, Chu says, “I think we will see a significant turnaround, both in the blockchain space, as well as in the indicative prices of major assets including Bitcoin, Ethereum and other major large-cap cryptocurrencies [...] This past year we saw ICE, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, launch Bakkt in conjunction with Microsoft and Starbucks. So we’re really seeing these blue chip brands entering the space. And I think that’s having a positive overall effect on the enthusiasm and the comfort of the asset.” His opinion on entry points for Bitcoin is shared with some others, notably Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, an insurance giant. Around two months ago, El-Erian said that bitcoin is best bought at USD 5,000 - a reiteration of his previous stance from June. However, El-Erian “doesn't expect it will get all the way back to USD 20,000.” However, some market analysts still do not rule out that the market might continue falling.

" Yesterday, we saw a nasty decline in bitcoin price below the USD 6,000 support. BTC/USD failed to hold the USD 5,600 support and extended declines. The price tested the USD 5,400 level and later staged a decent recovery. Similarly, ethereum price recovered above the USD 175 level, but it is struggling to surpass the USD 185 and USD 190 resistance levels. Ripple price performed well as it recovered above USD 0.460, but it is facing a solid resistance near USD 0.475 and USD 0.480. Bitcoin cash hard forked recently into BCHABC and BCHSV. On Binance, Bitcoin Cash ABC traded towards USD 350 and it is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) trading near USD 300. Bitcoin Cash SV traded as high as USD 150 and it is currently trading near USD 130. Total market capitalization  After a short term correction, bitcoin price  traded below the USD 5,600 swing low. BTC/USD declined around USD 200 and tested the USD 5,400 support area where buyers emerged. The price recovered and traded above the USD 5,550 and USD 5,600 levels.
However, sellers defended the USD 5,750 resistance, which is a significant pivot region. To rebound further, the price must break the USD 5,750 and USD 5,800 resistance levels. If not, the price may perhaps decline back towards the USD 5,400 level. Ethereum price  traded below the USD 175 support recently and tested the USD 170 level. Later, ETH/USD recovered above USD 170 and USD 175, but the price faced a strong resistance near USD 185.
The price is currently down around 1.5% to USD 180 and it seems like it could revisit the USD 175 level. If sellers remain in action, the price is likely to surpass the USD 170 support in the near term. Bitcoin cash  ABC clearly dominated as its price traded as high as USD 350. BCHABC/USD is currently trading near USD 300 and it seems like it could move higher towards USD 320 and USD 330 in the near term. On the other hand, BCHSV/USD is trading near the USD 130 level, with an immediate support at USD 120 and resistance at USD 150.
Ripple price  moved with a bullish angle recently and recovered above the USD 0.450 and USD 0.460 resistance levels. However, XRP/USD must surpass the USD 0.480 resistance to climb higher in the near term. A few small cap altcoins recovered between 5%-7% recently, including MONA, WAX, DOGE, BAT, GXS, ZRX, MCO, DGB, ZEN and XLM.
Overall, the recent recovery in bitcoin above USD 5,600 is facing many hurdles near USD 5,750 and USD 5,800. Therefore, there is a risk of more declines towards USD 5,400 or USD 5,200 in the coming sessions. Similarly, ethereum could decline below USD 170 if buyers fail to take control above USD 185 in the short term.

" Yesterday, we discussed how bitcoin price struggled to hold the lower end of the range support near USD 6,300. BTC/USD declined sharply below the range support and traded below many crucial support such as USD 6,000, USD 5,800 and USD 5,600. Similarly, almost all major altcoins declined heavily, including ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin, EOS, NEO and ADA. The current (UTC 08:30 AM) technical structure suggests that bitcoin moved into a medium term downtrend below USD 6,000 and the current year decline could extend further if buyers fail to protect losses below USD 5,500 and USD 5,000. Read more about the recent market crash here. Total market capitalization  There was a sharp downside reaction after bitcoin price  broke the USD 6,000 support. BTC/USD declined more than 10% and traded at a new 2018 low around USD 5,600. Later, the price started a short term recovery, but buyers are likely to struggle near the USD 5,750 and USD 5,800 resistance levels. 
More importantly, the previous major support at USD 6,000 will most likely act as a strong hurdle for buyers in the near term. Therefore, an upside correction is likely to be limited unless buyers push the price back above USD 6,000. Ethereum price  traded below the USD 200 support and declined around 12%. ETH/USD traded close to the USD 170 level and it is currently consolidating losses.
An initial resistance on the upside is at USD 180, above which the price may perhaps test the USD 190 zone. The main resistance is near USD 195 - USD 200, which was a support earlier. On the downside, a break below USD 170 might push the price towards USD 155. Bitcoin cash price  tumbled more than 15% from the USD 500 swing high and traded close to the USD 400 support area. BCH/USD is currently consolidating near USD 420 with a bearish angle. On the upside, the price is likely to face a strong selling interest near the USD 440 - USD 450 zone. The main support is at USD 400, below which the price may possibly accelerate towards USD 360.
Ripple price  fell sharply below the USD 0.500 support and traded close to the USD 0.420 support. XRP/USD recovered later and it is currently facing resistance near the USD 0.460 and USD 0.470 levels. Many small cap altcoins tumbled by around 15% recently, including RVN, IOST, HC, ARK, STRAT, AION, CMT, WTC, LRC, ELF, NEXO, MKR, PPT, ZIL, ETN and LISK. To sum up, the recent collapse in bitcoin price below USD 6,000 might indicate that this year’s decline is not over yet. BTC/USD and major altcoins may perhaps continue to bleed and there could be more losses. The main support for bitcoin buyers for the current wave is USD 5,000, below which the price might decline towards the USD 4,200 support in the medium term.

" After a strong sell-off the crypto market just touched new lows. On Thursday morning (UTC 05:50 AM), out of top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization only three are in green. Two of them - stablecoins. What is going on? What possible reasons for the sell-off are and what the market might expect? Let's dive in.  The price of bitcoin fell sharply Wednesday night and early Thursday morning, breaking the pattern of extremely low volatility seen over the past weeks and months. The technical support area formed by bitcoin’s previous low from late June was not enough to keep bitcoin prices from falling, and the sell-off did not stop until price reached USD 5,281 on Coinbase. The sell-off in bitcoin over the past 24 hours adds up to 11.2% on average across exchanges, data from CoinMarketCap shows. Data from the same source also reveals that bitcoin’s market capitalization has now fallen below USD 100 billion for the first time since October 2017, while the value of the entire cryptocurrency market has fallen from nearly 210 billion 24 hours ago to 184.2 billion as of press time. Top 10 coins by market capitalization in the past 24 hours: It’s still early to tell for sure what the reasons behind the most recent sell-off are, but some speculate that volatility in the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) market caused by the controversial BCH hard fork may have affected the BTC market as well. Interestingly, the overnight crypto sell-off also brought Ethereum and Ripple's XRP closer to each other in their battle for the number two spot on the ranking of the most valuable digital assets. Following a 14% sell-off in the price of ether, XRP has now overtaken Ethereum’s traditional position as the second most valuable cryptocurrency by a margin of about USD 100 million. Among other major movers Thursday morning, BCH again stood out with a loss of 18% over the past 24 hours. The sell-off follows heightened tensions ahead of the upcoming BCH hard fork, where Bitcoin SV has really caught up with the more mainstream fork proposal Bitcoin ABC in pre-fork trading on the Poloniex exchange. Best performers among top 100 coins: ____ Worst performers among top 100 coins: _____ Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro, a social trading platform:
“Three main factors are contributing to today’s drop in Bitcoin price.  Marshall Hayner, Founder of Metal Pay, a blockchain-based payments and rewards company: 
“To put it plainly, today’s dip is likely indicative of the fact that the most recent round of crypto speculators are capitulating. Thanks to revised short-term expectations that call into question the idea of a bull run by the end of the year, many are likely taking their chips off the table. A key takeaway from this most recent decline is the continued need for crypto liquidity, which will likely be found in future stages of industry maturation, hopefully in the form of adoption by retail consumers in their day-to-day activities.” Donald Bullers, North American Representative for Elastos, a developer of an internet operating system:
“It’s safe to say that Bitcoin Cash’s upcoming hard fork was stirring uncertainty amongst crypto investors, and forecasters across crypto and traditional markets alike have predicted a prolonged bear market heading into 2019. Crypto investors have proven to be highly reactive to changes across the landscape, and this dip could be the most recent case study of that phenomenon.” Casey Kuhlman, CEO of Monax Industries, a blockchain and smart contract software technology company:
""Crypto price slumps can often create misconceptions about the future of our industry, but perhaps what is most important to remember during periods of volatility is that the underlying blockchain technology solves real-world problems across the real economy. Crypto prices may rise and fall for reasons that are difficult to identify, however, the blockchain industry will remain strong and continue to grow."" Rohit Kulkarni, Managing Director of Private Investment Research at SharesPost, an online platform that links investors with late-stage venture-backed companies and shareholders: 
“We believe that there are three likely catalysts that could result in a crypto market turnaround in the next six months: There is greater clarity from regulators which could embolden the market; A select group of blockchain startups that have completed token offerings in the past year finally announce innovative commercial products; As smart money and institutional capital keeps piling up, investors pull the trigger and call the bottom of the market.” Meanwhile, Meltem Demirors, Chief Strategy Officer at CoinShares, a crypto focused investment company, sees brighter future for Bitcoin, but suggests that smaller cryptocurrencies might be in trouble. _____",2018-11-15
" There was no recovery in bitcoin price above the USD 6,450 and USD 6,500 resistance levels. BTC/USD extended losses and traded below the USD 6,400 support area. It seems like the price is closing in towards the lower end of the range support at USD 6,300 and USD 6,250 where buyers are likely to struggle. Similarly, ethereum price declined below the USD 208 support, opening the doors for a test of the USD 200 support area. Ripple price also started a downside correction below USD 0.520 and trimmed most its recent gains. Total market capitalization  There was yet another failure near the USD 6,450 resistance in bitcoin price . BTC/USD moved down and traded below the USD 6,400 support area. It seems like sellers are in control and they could even push the price towards the key support at USD 6,300. Further below, the USD 6,250 support is the last line of defense for buyers and represents the lower end of the range support.
If there is an upside correction, the price may struggle to clear the USD 6,420 and USD 6,450 resistance levels. The main resistance on the upside is near the USD 6,500 level. Ethereum price  broke the key support at USD 208 and declined further. ETH/USD is likely to extend declines towards the USD 200 - USD 202 support area where buyers are likely to emerge.
On the flip side, if there is an upside correction, the USD 210 level could prevent gains. The next key resistance for a larger upward move awaits near USD 215, above which the price could test USD 225. Bitcoin cash price  started consolidation above the USD 500 support area. BCH/USD could correct higher, but it is likely to face sellers near the USD 530 and USD 540 levels. Above both levels, the price may perhaps surpass the USD 550 level. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 505, below which the price possibly will break the USD 500 support.
Ripple price  started a downside correction and traded below the USD 0.520 and USD 0.515 levels. XRP/USD is about to reach the USD 0.505 support where it could find a strong buying interest. Many small cap altcoins declined more than 5% recently, including WAX, XEM, XIN, ARK, MITH, ZRX, BAT and HC. On the other hand, two altcoins, SRN and ETA gained 17% and 11% respectively. Overall, bitcoin price is at a risk of more losses below the USD 6,300 support if buyers fail to contain selling pressure. The main supports are USD 6,300 and USD 6,250, below which there could be heavy slides in the coming days. Similarly, ethereum is reaching the lower end of the range support near USD 202, below which the price may well extend its declines towards USD 180.

" After US retail giant Target had been hit by a bitcoin giveaway scam on Tuesday, on the same day Google fell victim to the same type of attack. However, this time the scammers left empty-handed.  According to a screenshot, shared by the the Twitter user @B_u_r_t_o_n  “Google” had seemingly decided to do “the biggest crypto-giveaway in the world.” The only thing users would have to do to participate in the “giveaway” was to “verify” their address by sending between 0.1 and 2 BTC – worth between 630 and 12,500 USD – to a bitcoin address, and then wait to receive between 1 and 20 BTC back.  The only problem, however, is that naïve users will never get any bitcoin back, and the hackers will instead run away with all the bitcoin they receive. In this case, the fake tweet, which came from G Suite’s (Google's brand of cloud computing, productivity and collaboration tools) verified Twitter account, was deleted after about 15 minutes. Google confirmed the breach. “We removed the tweet and are investigating with Twitter now,” a spokesperson for Google told Business Insider. However, it seems that the attack was a total failure. A search of the scammer’s Bitcoin address reveals that the corresponding wallet did not receive any bitcoins.  In comparison, in case of Target, scammers received a total of 5.86342085 BTC – about USD 36,887 – from unsuspecting victims.  So-called crypto giveaway scams have become a big problem on Twitter, and the social networking giant appears unable to stop the practice from spreading. A popular strategy among scammer is to set up accounts that impersonate famous people, and then launch a giveaway from that account. Tesla founder Elon Musk has for a long time been a favorite target for Twitter impersonators who typically creates accounts with usernames similar to the real Elon Musk.  Recently, however, more scams have occurred by hackers taking over control of verified Twitter accounts from well-known people (including Pope Francis and the US president Donald Trump) and companies to make the scam more believable, and then use those to ask for bitcoin payments. According to Twitter spokesperson, ""scammers are constantly changing their methods and it’s our job to stay on top of their movements, observe their actions and work to stay one step ahead. In most cases, our enforcement teams are detecting fraudulent activity and taking it down before it’s reported.""",2018-11-14
" During the past three sessions, there was no noticeable recovery in bitcoin above the USD 6,500 resistance. BTC/USD declined below the USD 6,450 support and it is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) trading with a bearish angle. Similarly, ethereum faced a lot of offers near the USD 215 resistance, resulting in a downside reaction. On the other hand, ripple recovered recently and moved above the USD 0.515 and 0.520 resistance levels. Going forward, bitcoin must move above the USD 6,500 resistance. If not, there is a risk of a sharp bearish reaction towards USD 6,200 in the near term. Total market capitalization  There was an increase in selling pressure on bitcoin price  and it failed to surpass the USD 6,500 resistance. BTC/USD traded close to the USD 6,400 support and it is currently consolidating losses. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 6,475, above which buyers are likely to struggle near USD 6,500.
On the flip side, if sellers gain pace below the USD 6,400 support, the price could move down sharply towards the USD 6,250 and USD 6,200 support levels in the short term. Ethereum price  made an attempt to surpass the USD 215 resistance, but it failed. ETH/USD is currently trading near the USD 208 support with range moves.
If there is a downside break below USD 208 or USD 206, the price will most likely trade below the USD 200 support. To rebound, buyers need to push the price above the USD 215 and USD 218 resistance levels. Bitcoin cash price  tested the USD 500 support recently and later recovered a few points. However, BCH/USD is still down around 2% and it remains at a risk of more losses if there is a close below the USD 500 support. On the upside, a break above the USD 525 and USD 530 levels is required for a decent recovery.
Ripple price  outperformed other major cryptocurrencies and recovered around 4%. XRP/USD moved above the USD 0.520 resistance and it may continue to rise in the near term towards USD 0.535 or USD 0.540. Despite bearish moves in bitcoin and ethereum, a few small altcoins managed to climb higher by more than 10%, including XEM, LINK, XET and ETA. Out of these, XEM gained around 12% and LINK rallied nearly 13%. To sum up, the recent moves suggest weakness in bitcoin price below the USD 6,500 resistance. If BTC/USD continues to fail near USD 6,475 and USD 6,500, there could be a downward move. Having said that, there are many key supports near USD 6,400 and USD 6,300. Therefore, it won’t be easy for sellers to gain momentum below USD 6,400.

" This past week, bitcoin price jumped above the USD 6,500 and USD 6,550 resistance levels. However, BTC/USD failed to stay above the USD 6,600 resistance and later started a major downward move. The price trimmed most gains and settled below the USD 6,500 support level. Similarly, ethereum price declined from well above USD 220 and it is currently above the USD 208 support level. More importantly, ripple price declined sharply and tested the USD 0.500 support. At the outset, it seems like bitcoin and major altcoins are under pressure and remain at a risk of a downside break. Total market capitalization  Recently, bitcoin price  moved below the USD 6,500 and USD 6,450 support levels. BTC/USD tested the USD 6,400 support and later recovered a few points. The price is currently consolidating around USD 6,450, with an immediate resistance at USD 6,500. 
The main weekly resistance is at USD 6,600, above which the price may move towards the USD 6,750 level. On the other hand, if buyers fail to push the price above USD 6,500 and USD 6,550, there could be more downsides. The key weekly support is at USD 6,400, below which the price will most likely slide towards the USD 6,200 support. Ethereum price  also trimmed most gains and declined below the USD 215 support. ETH/USD tested the USD 208 support level and it is currently consolidating losses.
On the upside, the price must move past USD 215 and USD 220 to start a new upward move. If not, there is a risk of a bearish break below the USD 208 and USD 206 supports. The main weekly support is at USD 200, below which the price could drop to USD 185. Bitcoin cash price  is down more than USD 100 from the last week’s high and it is currently trading just above the USD 500 support. If BCH/USD declined below the USD 500 support, sellers could take control and push the price towards the USD 450 support area. On the upside, resistances are seen near USD 540, USD 550 and USD 575.
Ripple price  traded below the USD 0.525 and 0.515 support levels to move into a bearish zone. However, XRP/USD is still above the USD 0.500 support and there are slight chances of a decent recovery in the near term. Many altcoins declined recently and registered losses more than 5% today, including XET, VERI, SC, BAT, RVN, IOST, revain, DOGE and ZEC. Out of these, XET is down around 11% and VERI fell roughly 8%. Overall, bitcoin price seems to be struggling to recover above USD 6,500. If BTC/USD continues to face selling pressure, there is a risk of a bearish break below the USD 6,420 and USD 6,400 support levels. Similarly, ethereum and ripple must recover above key resistances (USD 220 and USD 0.525 respectively) to avoid a sharp decline.

" After trading above the USD 6,660 level, bitcoin price started a downside correction. BTC/USD declined below USD 6,550 and recently tested a major support near USD 6,500, which protected further losses. Similarly, ethereum tested the USD 215 support and it is currently consolidating in a tight range. On the other hand, bitcoin cash and ripple declined a few more points and later managed to recover. The current market sentiment is neutral and it seems like there could be range moves in bitcoin and ethereum before the next move.  Total market capitalization  There was an extended downside correction below the USD 6,550 support in bitcoin price . BTC/USD declined and traded below the USD 6,525 level. The price tested the next major support at USD 6,500, which acted as a solid barrier for sellers.
At the moment, the price is slowly recovering, but the previous supports at USD 6,520 and USD 6,530 may perhaps act as resistances. The main resistance could be USD 6,550, above which the price will most likely revisit the USD 6,660 resistance. Ethereum price  traded below the USD 215 support recently, but later it managed to recover. ETH/USD is currently consolidating near USD 215 and it is preparing for the next move.
Buyers need to gain strength above the USD 220 and USD 225 levels to accelerate upsides. On the other hand, a break below the USD 215 support may push the price back towards the USD 210 support. Bitcoin cash price  extended slides and traded below the USD 630 and USD 600 support levels. BCH/USD traded close to the USD 570 support and later recovered. It is currently trading near USD 600, with an immediate resistance at USD 620 followed by USD 630. On the downside, the USD 580 and USD 570 levels are important supports.
Ripple price  declined sharply and even spiked below the USD 0.500 support as discussed yesterday. XRP/USD tested the USD 0.495 level and bounced back. It is currently recovering, but it may face a strong resistance near USD 0.520. During the past few hours, a few altcoins gained traction, including XET, WAX and MANA. XET (Eternal Token) is up more than 25% and WAX extended gains and traded up around 18%. Overall, bitcoin price extended its downside correction and it is not at a risk of a downside break below USD 6,480 - USD 6,500. Should BTC/USD fail to bounce back above USD 6,550, sellers are likely to gain strength. A daily close below USD 6,480 or USD 6,450 may accelerate declines in bitcoin in the coming days. Similarly, ethereum must stay above the USD 208 support and ripple price should break the USD 0.520 - USD 0.525 resistance zone to move back in a positive zone.

" Recently, there were positive moves in bitcoin above the USD 6,550 level. BTC/USD even traded above the USD 6,600 level and later started a downside correction. The price is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) consolidating gains above the USD 6,550 support and dips remain supported. Similarly, ethereum retreated from the USD 225 resistance and it is currently trading near the USD 215 support. Besides, ripple and bitcoin cash have corrected lower and both are approaching important support levels. Total market capitalization  A fresh correction wave was initiated from well above the USD 6,600 level in bitcoin price . BTC/USD traded below the USD 6,575 level and tested the USD 6,550 support (the previous resistance). The price is currently consolidating and it seems like there could be a renewed upside above USD 6,580 in the near term.
On the flip side, if there is an extended downside correction, the price may perhaps test the next major support at USD 6,500. The overall price action is positive as long as bitcoin is above USD 6,550 and USD 6,500. Ethereum price  also corrected lower recently and traded below the USD 220 level. ETH/USD tested the USD 215 level and it is currently consolidating. If it stays above USD 215, there might be an upward move above the USD 220 level.
If not, the price could slide further towards the USD 208 support, which was a significant barrier for buyers previously and now it is likely to hold losses. Bitcoin cash price  started a sharp downside correction below the USD 600 level. BCH/USD is down more than 4% and it is currently heading towards the USD 570 support. If there are further losses, the price may well test the USD 550 support. On the upside, an initial resistance is near USD 600, above which the price may retest USD 630.
Ripple price  is slightly under pressure as it failed to stay above the USD 0.530 and USD 0.525 support levels. The next major support awaits near USD 0.500 where XRP/USD will most likely find a strong buying interest. On the upside, the previous supports at USD 0.525 and USD 0.530 might act as resistances. Despite the recent correction in bitcoin, a few small cap altcoins traded higher between 5%-8%, including POLY, WAX, BAT and NPXS. Out of these, POLY is up around 8% and WAX gained roughly 7%. To sum up, it seems like bitcoin is correcting recent gains, but there are many supports on the downside between USD 6,560 and USD 6,500. If there is a downside break below USD 6,500, there are chances of a sharp decline in BTC/USD. Similarly, ethereum must stay above the USD 208 and USD 202 support levels. If not, there is a risk of a fresh bearish wave below USD 200.

" According to data from the popular crypto exchange Bitfinex, the number of short positions on bitcoin have just hit its lowest level since early August, a clear indication that the sentiment surrounding the number one cryptocurrency is becoming more positive. At the same time, the number of long positions on the exchange has increased, overtaking the number of shorts on November 2. Prior to that, the bears have consistently been in the majority, as seen in the chart below. Bitcoin short orders in red and bitcoin long orders in blue on Bitfinex: Meanwhile, the ratio between short and long positions on bitcoin has dropped to 0.86, which means that there is now a net long-bias among Bitfinex users. That marks a distinct change for the market, which has been overwhelmingly short-biased over the past few months.  A short-to-long ratio of 1 (red line on the chart) indicates neutral market conditions, where neither bears nor bulls are in the majority. Bitcoin short-to-long ratio on Bitfinex: It’s worth noting that distorted market conditions where either the long side or the short side becomes “overcrowded” tends to cause temporary reversals in the market. This is for example what we have seen happening during the multiple “short-squeezes” this year, leading to sharply higher prices. Similarly, an abundance of long trades can cause pullbacks to become sharper and more violent than they would otherwise be. At today’s levels, however, the ratio is still healthy and we are far from extreme levels. Instead, it is likely a reaction to prices gradually moving higher after having been flat for weeks.",2018-11-07
" Yesterday, we discussed chances of more upsides in bitcoin above the USD 6,500 resistance. BTC/USD did trade higher and broke the USD 6,500 and USD 6,550 resistance levels. The price traded to a new monthly high above USD 6,600 before starting a short term correction. Bitcoin cash rallied close to 15%, and surpassed the USD 600 barrier.

Total market capitalization  There was an upward move in bitcoin price  above the USD 6,500 resistance. BTC/USD gained momentum and traded above the USD 6,550 and USD 6,600 resistance levels. The price is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) consolidating with corrective moves near USD 6,580. An initial support is at USD 6,550, below which the USD 6,500 level could act as a strong support.
On the upside, the price is likely to climb above USD 6,600 once again and it seems like buyers might attempt to push the price above USD 6,650 or USD 6,700 in the near term. Ethereum price  continued to trade higher and it recently broke the USD 220 resistance. ETH/USD is showing a lot of positive signs and it seems like the price may accelerate towards the USD 225 and USD 230 levels in the near term.
If there is a downside correction, the USD 215 - USD 216 zone is likely to act as a solid support. Below the stated zone, the next key support is at USD 210, which was a resistance earlier. Bitcoin cash price  started a fresh rally and surged above the USD 575 and USD 600 resistance levels. BCH/USD is up around 15% and it seems like the price is preparing for a test of the USD 650 resistance. The main supports on the downside are aligned near the USD 620 and USD 620 levels.
Ripple price  mostly remained flat and it is slowly correcting lower below USD 0.540. It seems like XRP/USD could extend the current correction and test the USD 0.525 support area where buyers are likely to emerge. Many small cap altcoins gained traction recently and traded up more than 5%, including AOA, QTUM, ZEC, BTM, GXS and ZEN. Out of these QTUM is performing really well as buyers pushed the price above the USD 4.00 resistance. Overall, bitcoin buyers are gaining pace and it seems like the price is likely to climb higher towards USD 6,650 and USD 6,700 levels in the coming sessions. If BTC/USD breaks the USD 6,700 barrier, it could boost the market sentiment and altcoins like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, neo, litecoin, icon, wan and binance coin possibly might gain upside momentum.

" American actress Gwyneth Paltrow is the latest in the line of celebrities promoting Bitcoin, tweeting out a Q&A with Bill Barhydt, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Abra, from her site called Goop. Her site has supposedly evolved from a lifestyle newsletter into a “lifestyle brand” in the past 10 years of existence, but this Q&A is the first time cryptocurrencies are mentioned there. The Q&A delves into the basic questions of what Bitcoin is, how you can get some, and what gives it value. Barhydt also answers questions about other cryptocurrencies and blockchain itself for a short, simplistic overview of the topic.  Great piece with @billbarhydt on @goop today https://t.co/cBoeHJ9ts7 On the topic of value, Barhydt explains, “Ultimately, anything has value because people agree that it has value. Government-issued money, such as the US dollar, has value because we all agree that it does, mostly because our government accepts payments of tax debts only in its own money.” He also explains the unique points of Bitcoin versus fiat currencies, such as mining, the network effect and scarcity. He adds, “Lastly, we believe Bitcoin technology will be used to enable people in developing markets to lease home electronics such as washing machines, refrigerators, televisions, etc. The buyer will simply forward a small amount of Bitcoin every week to the wallet of the seller and this will enable the appliance to function. This is not easily possible with traditional government money, and it is a powerful possibility.” Featuring a Bitcoin Q&A on Paltrow’s site has the community divided. “...and people are calling this a bear market,” tweeted Jackson Palmer, creator of Dogecoin, in reply to Paltrow’s tweet. However, user @shillycrypto replies to him, “I genuinely hate Goop so I guess I have to sell everything now.” Goop is widely controversial and often considered a peddler of pseudoscience. From using stickers “made of spacesuits” to “rebalance energy” (which NASA debunked), over doing colonics to “remove toxins” from your body (unclear which toxins, and Mayo Clinic debunked that too), to letting bees sting you to “get rid of inflammation and scarring” (which killed a woman in Spain - and all of this is even without mentioning the jade egg controversy. In a similar vein, Twitter user @Leishman writes, “Can’t wait to buy my magic crystals with bitcoin! This is what the world needs,” while @CAntkow writes, “So this explains the price dropping…”  Paltrow is also far from the first celebrity to show interest in crypto. From 50 Cent - who claimed bankruptcy - over Steven Seagal, to Ashton Kutcher, many have dipped their toes into the nascent industry. Even Kim Kardashian mentioned Bitcoin to her 114 million followers.",2018-11-06
" In a newly released ranking of digital assets by the Chinese government-affiliated organization China Center for Information Industry Development (CCID), Bitcoin – by far the most popular digital asset in the world – has fallen to 19th place. The ranking, titled Global Public Blockchain Technology Assessment Index, assesses crypto projects based on criteria such as technology, applicability, and creativity, among other things. This time around, EOS secured the top spot, followed by Ethereum (ETH) and BitShares (BTS). A total of 33 public blockchain projects were assessed in the ranking. EOS is the fifth most valuable digital asset by market capitalization, while ETH is number two, and BTS is number 34. This is now the sixth time the ranking is released, and bitcoin has fallen consistently from the 13th place in the first ranking to the 19th place now. On the flip-side, however, EOS and Ethereum are two of the projects that have consistently gotten high rankings in the report, securing the first and second place in the past five ranking reports. “At present, EOS and Ethereum are undoubtedly the preferred platforms for dapp [decentralized application] development worldwide, and EOS is showing stronger momentum,” a translation of the report read. In a previous issue of the report, the authors also praised EOS, saying it received the number one spot because of its “outstanding technical advantages in transaction confirmation efficiency, network throughput, and transaction costs.” The fact that EOS secured the number one spot on the ranking is particularly interesting in the light of a new study from blockchain testing company Whiteblock, which shockingly concluded that “EOS is not a blockchain,” but rather a distributed homogeneous database management system. “EOS block producers are highly centralized and users can only access the network using block producers as intermediaries. Block producers are a single point of failure for the entire system,” Whiteblock’s new report said.",2018-11-06

" Although we all know that long-term “hodling” and cold storage devices that are locked down for years at a time, has always been a part of the bitcoin community, new data compiled by the US-based cryptoasset analytics firm Coin Metrics for Bloomberg reveals more about the true extent of it. According to the data, 3 out of every 4 bitcoin in existence has not moved at all over the past 6 months, despite the downturn in the bitcoin market. The finding marks a big change from the situation during the bitcoin rally in late 2017, when about half of all bitcoins had been on the move. “It tells me we are still in a Bitcoin recession” https://t.co/sYJ19eJg0K pic.twitter.com/yInVvA9Shj The finding might be also surprising given the large number of new investors who flocked to bitcoin during the huge price rally of 2017. One might imagine that most of these new investors would be “weak hands” in the bitcoin market, susceptible to selling their holdings once the price moved lower. This, however, seems not to have been the case, which suggests that we have not seen the capitulation in the market many have been waiting for. According to many long-term believers in bitcoin, a “total capitulation” is needed for the market to finally find a bottom and form a strong foundation for the next bull market. “It tells me we are still in a Bitcoin recession,” Nic Carter, co-founder of Coin Metrics, told Bloomberg in a comment. According to Coin Metrics, up to 40% of bitcoins rarely moves because they are either lost or held in long-term cold storage. The firm further estimates that another 25% to 35% can be considered semi-liquid, which means they become active during bull markets as some long-term investors cash out to secure profits. Previously, research by weekly cryptocurrency publication Diar has revealed that over one third of the total bitcoin supply, or 55% of circulating bitcoin, is held in wallets with more than 200 BTC in each that have never made an outgoing transaction. Still, 27% of these wallets have continued to accumulate coins during the bear market in anticipation of the next leg up in the bitcoin market, the research showed.",2018-11-01

Specifically, the bank has reportedly onboarded clients to trade its forward contracts on bitcoin, a type of derivative that is tied to the futures market, The Block reported this week, citing a “direct source.” In other words, crypto trading at Goldman Sachs is still strictly limited to derivatives, and does not involve any “physical” cryptocurrencies changing hands.  However, the bank is in no rush to roll out more crypto derivatives products, according to the report. The source also said that earlier reports that Goldman is exploring similar derivatives contracts for ether “isn’t accurate.” The steps taken by Goldman Sachs in the crypto world is watched by many in the community due to its fame and position as one of the most prominent financial institutions in the world. ‘If Goldman Sachs embraces crypto, everyone else will too’, the reasoning goes. It is already known that Goldman Sachs is working to set up a trading desk for cryptocurrency derivatives. Back in September, Goldman’s Chief Financial Officer Marty Chavez (he’s leaving the post on November 5 to become Vice Chairman of the firm and Co-Head of the Securities Division) stated publicly that no plans had changed in regards to the trading desks, despite earlier reports that the bank would postpone the plans.   In the past, Goldman Sachs has also invested in a number of blockchain-related companies, including Circle and the California-based blockchain security company BitGo, in a funding round that brought in USD 58.5 million from several prominent investors.",2018-11-01
" Yesterday, bitcoin price moved into a bearish zone below the USD 6,400 support level. BTC/USD is currently consolidating above the USD 6,300 level, but there are a lot of bearish signs visible on lower timeframe charts. Equally, ethereum is trading below the USD 200 support with a negative bias, which could spark a fresh decline towards the USD 180 level.  Other major altcoins like dash, bitcoin cash, neo and litecoin are struggling to recover. They are trading near yearly lows and remain at a risk of more losses. LTC/USD is currently trading well below the Oct 31, 2017 low of USD 56.00 and just above the US 47.80 yearly low. It seems like litecoin could decline further to trade to a new yearly low below USD 47.00 if it continues to struggle. Similarly, dash, neo and bitcoin cash are down and trading well below levels seen one year ago on Oct 31, 2017. More importantly, if sellers remain in action, these coins could accelerate declines and trade to a new 2018 low in the near term. Total market capitalization  After yesterday’s decline bitcoin price  found support near the USD 6,300 level and later started consolidating losses. BTC/USD is currently trading above the USD 6,330 level with an immediate resistance at USD 6,360. However, main hurdles for buyers are USD 6,380 and USD 6,400, above which the price might move back in a positive zone.
On the other hand, if the price fails to recover, it may perhaps slide back towards USD 6,300. Any further declines will most likely push the price towards the USD 6,250 support area. Ethereum price  is currently consolidating losses below the USD 200 level. ETH/USD seems to be preparing for the next decline if buyers fail to push the price back above the USD 200 and USD 202 resistance levels.
On the downside, an immediate support is at USD 195, below which the price could trade to a new monthly low. The main support for buyers on the downside is near the USD 180 level. Bitcoin cash price  is struggling a lot below the USD 430 level. It seems like BCH/USD may continue to slide and it could break the USD 400 handle as well to form a new yearly low. 
Ripple price  is slowly declining towards the USD 0.440 support. If XRP/USD fails to stay above the USD 0.440 support, sellers may well gain strength to take the price towards the USD 0.420 level. On the upside, resistances are seen near USD 0.450 and 0.455. Despite the current market sentiment, a few small cap coins traded higher between 6%-12%, including dentacoin, chainlink and pivx.
Overall, bitcoin price is slowly approaching key supports like USD 6,250, below which there is a risk of a sharp decline. If buyers continue to struggle, there is a possibility of a larger downward move in bitcoin, ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin, dash, neo and other major cryptocurrencies.

" The beginning of 2019 might bring tax-related news to the UK’s crypto market.  Her Majesty's (HM) Treasury is working closely with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to consider the tax issues raised by cryptoassets and the revised guidance is estimated to be released by early 2019, according to a new report from the UK’s Cryptoasset Taskforce, jointly published by HM Treasury, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and the Bank of England.  Both authorities recognise the risks of tax avoidance and evasion arising from the increased use of cryptoassets and are continuing to review the range of enforcement tools and approaches at HMRC’s disposal, the report added.   Also, in the report, several heavy-handed measures are discussed to regulate and control how British citizens should interact with digital assets. In the report, the FCA – the UK’s main financial regulator – said that “there are substantial potential risks associated with cryptoassets” and that the government’s priority is to “mitigate” these risks, “and prevent the use of cryptoassets for illicit activity.” The authors added that “strong action” should be taken by the authorities to address the perceived risks. Perhaps the most severe action proposed in the report is a potential ban on all cryptoasset derivatives, including futures contracts and contracts for difference (CFDs), which are all popular instruments among traders. According to the report, “the FCA will consult on a prohibition of the sale to retail consumers of all derivatives referencing exchange tokens such as Bitcoin, including CFDs, futures, options and transferable securities.” The futures market, for example, is already a heavily regulated marketplace where large traders either take bets, or hedge risks from elsewhere, with the use of contracts that track the price of an underlying asset – in this case bitcoin.  Ironically, an active futures market for bitcoin has been mentioned as a requirement from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for it to approve any bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF). Now, it appears the UK is moving in the opposite direction as it seeks to ban any futures contracts based on cryptoassets such as bitcoin. Meanwhile, the report stressed that “the authorities will continue to encourage and enable experimentation and innovation, so that DLT [distributed ledger technology] and other new technologies can develop and be adopted safely in the financial system.”   It also added, that “the backbone of the existing payments system – the Bank of England’s new RTGS [real-time gross settlement] service - will be compatible with DLT - based payment systems, supporting further innovation and use of DLT in financial services.” Although the report did also list potential benefits of cryptoassets, they were few compared to the risks discussed.  The report noted that cryptoassets today deliver few benefits, but added that “benefits may materialize in the future, for example through the use of ICOs [initial coin offerings] as a capital raising tool.” In the community, people are discussing whether the proposed regulations by the Cryptoasset Taskforce are appropriate, with some even asking if the agency is going far enough: UK moves in the right direction to provide regulatory certainty on #cryptoassets and #cryptocurrency.  I'm sure a welcome development. However, will it be enough? https://t.co/rc2XiV3LR6 Others, however, question the authors’ level of understanding of the subject matter: It's also funny that the Cryptoasset Taskforce calls cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin ""exchange tokens"" pic.twitter.com/OifROyT64n In the past, the FCA led a group of global regulators known as the Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN) in drafting a consultation document on the issue of regulatory sandboxes for fin-tech firms. Among other things, the document proposed that regulators in different countries should work together to “support responsible innovation” in areas such as distributed ledger technology and ICOs, as well as requirements pertaining to know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML).",2018-10-31
" If we are to believe recent headlines, bitcoin may single handedly be responsible for pushing global warming beyond 2 degrees Celsius and ruin the environment for future generations.  “Bitcoin may cause catastrophic climate change by 2033,” The Telegraph warned in an article on Monday. “Bitcoin is actually going to ruin the world,” CNET wrote, while Israeli newspaper Haaretz warned us that “[…] Bitcoin is making the world dangerously hotter, dangerously fast.” These headlines are just some of the articles that were published yesterday following a new research report by an interdisciplinary team of scientists from the University of Hawaii, published in Nature, an international journal of science. According to the report, bitcoin “could alone produce enough CO2  (carbon dioxide) emissions to push warming above 2°C within less than three decades.” However, at the same time the authors acknowledge that bitcoin mining is becoming more energy efficient. Meanwhile, other experts and scientist who spoke with ThinkProgess, a news website backed by the think tank Center for American Progress Action Fund, described the study’s assumptions and conclusions as “reckless” and “dangerous, irresponsible, and misleading.”  According to mechanical engineering professor Eric Masanet, head of the Energy and Resource Systems Analysis Lab at Northwestern University, the conclusions in the study can be debunked by pointing to three flaws: First, he said, “we know that the global power sector is decarbonizing.” Secondly, the IT sector, including mining of cryptocurrencies, is becoming more and more energy efficient. Lastly, he said the authors behind the study are “insisting on tremendous growth in cryptocurrency adoption, resulting in inflated and dubious estimates of future carbon emissions.” Arman Shehabi of Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, a Department of Energy Office of Science lab managed by University of California, agreed with Masanet, and added that the authors of the study were on the wrong track by focusing on a very unlikely scenario where “the electricity demand of bitcoin transactions and the carbon emissions from that electricity demand both remain static over the next hundred years, while at the same time bitcoin immediately undergoes rapid adoption.” He told ThinkProgress that it is “absurd” to believe the energy consumption of each individual bitcoin transaction will remain constant over the next hundred years, saying “that’s a crazy assumption in general, but downright bananas for blockchain mining.” Back in August, Katrine Kelly-Pitou, Research Associate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh also said that the worries about bitcoin’s energy usage are exaggerated. Instead, she argues, the important factor is not how much energy bitcoin consumes, but what the energy sources are, while advocating for more mining in countries and regions with an abundant supply of clean and renewable energy. According to Kelly-Pitou, bitcoin mining uses an exorbitant amount of power: somewhere between an estimated 30 terrawatt hours alone in 2017 alone, while banking consumes an estimated 100 terrawatts of power annually.",2018-10-30
" Banks in Panama, which is one of the Top 20 countries by crypto ATMs per capita, appear to be refusing cryptocurrency transactions, per media reports, sparking fears that a crackdown has begun. Per newspaper La Estrella de Panama, “a handful of users” have claimed that their bank accounts – and those of their cryptocurrency-trading acquaintances – “were closed upon [the banks] learning that they traded in cryptocurrencies or just for having [crypto holdings].” Trading in cryptocurrencies is not illegal in Panama, a country with the population of 4 million, but the newspaper stated “it seems that the financial sector has gone from caution to rejection.” Crypto community leaders bemoaned the fact that their relationship with the banks “has been very, very complicated” so far. The newspaper says it has been in touch with several banks in the country, which have all so far chosen not to respond on the matter. It quotes Felipe Echandi, co-founder of Panama Fintech, a Panamanian blockchain community and pressure group, as stating, “I don’t work with cryptocurrencies personally, but I do know of cases where [banks have refused to deal with clients involved with cryptocurrencies].” Echandi added, “Unfortunately in Panama, in the case of fintech enterprises, it is very complicated for banks to open accounts. I had to go explain my own business model 50 times to different banks.” The country’s banking regulator, the Superintendency of Banks of Panama, has previously warned the public about the “risks” associated with trading in cryptocurrencies, stating that government regulations do not cover the exchange, purchase, sale or investment of digital tokens. The lack of regulation in the crypto and blockchain space, especially for projects that raised funds through initial coin offerings (ICOs), is keeping even compliant projects from working, as previously reported by Cryptonews.com. Some projects eve complain that ""If you’re a good citizen complying with accounting, opening bank accounts, doing everything correctly, you can still get hit every single week by institutions, service providers, partners that tell you they’re not working with you anymore just because you’re dealing with cryptocurrencies.""

" The world’s oldest surviving Bitcoin exchange, Bitstamp, has been bought by NXMH, a Belgium-based investment company. This represents yet another example of traditional investors moving into the cryptocurrency industry - a recent trend that has been on the uprise throughout 2018. Bitstamp CEO, Nejc Kodrič, writes in the official announcement, “Bitstamp has been regularly approached by suitors for quite some time. The reason why we finally decided to sell the company is a combination of the quality of the buyer, the quality of the offer and the fact that the industry is at a point where consolidation makes sense. A major factor in agreeing to the sale is that the mission, leadership and vision of the company remains the same.”  Through the purchase, NXMH acquires an 80% stake, while Kodrič retains a 10% ownership interest in the exchange, according to Reuters. Pantera Capital Management LP, which made a USD 10 million investment in the company in 2014, also sold part of its stake in Bitstamp to NXMH, the report added. NXMH, with assets under management of more than EUR 2 billion, is the European subsidiary of South Korea-based NXC, which invests in digital technologies. NXC also owns South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Korbit and Nexon, a South Korean gaming company.  Back in April this year, the exchange had been rumored to be in talks with Nexon regarding the acquisition. Nexon Korea CEO Lee Jung-hun denied the rumors that pegged the price of the exchange at around USD 350 million. In 2016, Bitstamp was valued at USD 60 million, Kodrič told Reuters today. Kodrič stresses that nothing about Bitstamp’s services will change: “We do anticipate that this acquisition will strengthen Bitstamp’s positioning for growth, which will provide opportunities to better serve our customers. Customers should not have any concerns about their accounts or changes to the way we operate,” he adds. Bitstamp was founded in 2011 in Slovenia by Kodrič and Damian Merlak. However, Marlek sold his entire 30% stake in Bitstamp with the deal, and has not been active since 2015, according to Reuters. The registration of the company was moved to the UK in April 2013, then to Luxembourg in 2016. The company was founded as a European-focused alternative to then-dominant bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. While the company trades in US dollars, it accepts fiat money deposits for free only via the European Union's Single Euro Payments Area, a mechanism for transferring money between European bank accounts. Top markets on Bitstamp: As traditional investors are moving into the space with increasing frequency, this seems to be the boost many companies need: after the Singapore-based BK Global Consortium bought a controlling share in South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb, trading shot up by some 25% over the following weekend.  Japan is another example of this trend. Coincheck was taken over by financial services company Monex earlier this year after falling victim to a hack in January, with another financial sector company, Fisco, set to complete the takeover of last month’s hack victim, Zaif, late next month, as Cryptonews.com previously reported. “Major companies are likely to continue targeting [exchanges] for a while yet,” wrote Japanese business media outlet M&A Online in an editorial piece.",2018-10-29
" In what appears to be one of the worst handlings of a crypto exchange crisis we have seen to date, MapleChange, a relatively small crypto exchange based in Edmonton, Canada, on Sunday announced that “someone have managed to withdraw all funds from our exchange,” adding that “until the investigation is over, we cannot refund anything.” Due to a bug, some people have managed to withdraw all the funds from our exchange. We are in the process of a thorough investigation for this. We are extremely sorry that it has to come to end like this. Until the investigation is over, we cannot refund anything. Later they added that “because we have no more funds to pay anyone back, the exchange has to close down unfortunately.” According to the archived version (October 28) of the exchange's website that claims it’s “a swift, reliable and to-the-point trading platform for veterans and newbies alike”, it has more than 8,000 registered users and it's daily trading volume was more than BTC 900 (USD 5.8 million) “today.” Meanwhile, on October 27, the exchange announced that its maintenance was “officially over and we have finished upgrading our server” and invited to “enjoy our new sleek look, stay tuned for future updates as we're not yet done.” As of Monday morning, the website is unavailable. Following the news yesterday, members of the community have been hard at work to find out who is behind the exchange, which does not provide information on its team members online. A Twitter account called Maplechange’ed has already identified the person they believe is behind the questionable exchange as a young man living in Edmonton, Canada, along with many other details about the people behind the exchange. Following the first Twitter post, the exchange disabled their Twitter account, and rumors of the “hack” actually being a classic exit scam quickly started circulating online.  6 Million Dollar Exit Scam. Rofl In case of an exit scam, someone who runs a crypto service first builds up trust among customers, who then go on to deposit money with the service. Once a sufficient amount of money or digital assets have been gathered, the service shuts down and the operators disappear. As many would probably agree, disabling social media and other communication channels “to think this solution through” is a highly suspicious way of handling what the company claims to be a hack.  However, five hours later, MapleChange’s Twitter account finally came back online with this tweet: We have not disappeared guys. We simply turned off our accounts temporarily to think this solution through. We cannot refund everyone all their funds, but we will be opening wallets to whatever we have left so people can (hopefully) withdraw their funds. The incident should serve as an important reminder to everyone in the crypto community not to keep fiat or crypto stored on any exchanges. Instead, it is generally recommended to transfer funds to external software or hardware wallets where the user holds the private keys, after a trade has been completed. MapleChange has not yet responded to a request for comment on this story by Cryptonews.com. We will update the story once we hear from them.",2018-10-29
" Last week, we reported that bitcoin prices are now nearly as stable as Apple stocks, however, it appears that we were just scratching the surface for how stable these prices can really become. It may be a sign that bitcoin is nearing a bottom, according to experts. However, no one knows when the next major move will happen.  Compared to last Monday, the bitcoin price is practically unchanged, giving developers the calm they need to put their heads down and work, while traders are becoming increasingly restless. Bitcoin price chart: Over the past 12 days, bitcoin prices have been so stable that technical analysts, who make trading decisions based on patterns and indicators on charts, are scratching their heads trying to figure out where the price is headed next. This is what the legendary trader Peter Brandt had to say on Twitter this weekend: 12 days in a 2.2% trading range. Not sure there is another similar period in BTC history. Equilibrium between supply and demand is amazing. Will not last long. $BTC pic.twitter.com/L4N5Sa06c3 As expected, the bitcoin community responded with a sense of humour, as they often do:  pic.twitter.com/oyZWz3w4FK In an article from CNBC this weekend, bitcoin’s record-low volatility is presented as surprising news given the sharp sell-off that occurred in the global stock market last week. “As U.S. stock markets went haywire this week, the major cryptocurrency known for giving investors whiplash was surprisingly calm,” according to the report. However, the network’s go-to guest for all-things crypto, CEO of crypto investment firm BKCM Brian Kelly, reminded that crypto remains a non-correlated asset class, saying “I don't know of anyone saying 'Microsoft dropped, I better sell bitcoin to cover my margin’.” Meanwhile, others argue that low volatility is a sign that bitcoin may be nearing a bottom. As Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone noted, high volatility is a major factor lessening most cryptocurrency use cases for anything other than speculation. In the same report by Bloomberg, Charlie Morris, multi-asset head at Atlantic House Fund Management in London, added that ""Given this bear market is now 10 months old and is getting tired, I’d be inclined to be bullish for the next major move.” In the meantime, Google searches do not show that people’s interest in bitcoin is picking up, which might mean that the market relies on existing investors, mostly.    Looking at global search interest for the word “bitcoin,” we can see that it is now at the lowest levels seen since April 2017, when the price of bitcoin was just over USD 1,000. Related terms like “buy bitcoin” or “trade bitcoin” gives us nearly identical results.",2018-10-29
" Bitcoin price extended range moves with a bearish angle below the USD 6,500 level. BTC/USD is currently (UTC 06:20 AM) struggling to hold the USD 6,450 support level and it seems like it could decline further in the near term. Similarly, ethereum price struggled to move higher and it is currently trading near the USD 200 support. If there is a downside break below USD 200, ETH/USD may possibly decline sharply. Ripple is comparatively stable above the USD 0.450 support, but it is facing a tough resistance near the USD 0.460 and USD 0.462 levels. Total market capitalization  There was no upward move above USD 6,500 in bitcoin price . BTC/USD remained under pressure and it slowly moved down towards the USD 6,450 support. At the outset, it seems like the price is struggling to remain above the USD 6,450 support and it could continue to move down towards the USD 6,400 support.
If sellers gain momentum, there is a risk of a downside break towards the USD 6,250 level in the near term. On the other hand, buyers need to clear the USD 6,500 and USD 6,550 barriers to push the price back in a positive zone. Ethereum price  also followed bitcoin as it struggled to break the USD 205 resistance zone. ETH/USD is currently moving lower towards the main support at USD 200.
If sellers succeed in gaining strength below the USD 200 support, the price may decline sharply towards the USD 190 or USD 185 level. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 205, above which the price may attempt to surpass USD 208 and USD 210. Bitcoin cash price  declined below the USD 440 support, which is a bearish sign. It seems like BCH/USD could continue to decline towards the next support at USD 425. The next key support below USD 425 is near the USD 405 level. The main resistance for an upward move is near the USD 450 level.
Ripple price  is currently consolidating above the USD 0.450 support. XRP/USD may climb further higher if there is a break above the USD 0.460 and USD 0.462 resistances. On the flip side, a break below USD 0.450 may increase bearish pressure on ripple. Today, a few altcoins gained more than 10%, including revain, kyber network (KNC), veritaseum and nexo. Out of these, revain rallied more than 30% and KNC gained around 25%. Overall, bitcoin price seems to be under pressure below USD 6,500. If BTC/USD continues to struggle to clear the USD 6,500 and USD 6,550 resistance, there could be a fresh downward move. Altcoins also remain at a risk of a downside break if they continue to face heavy selling interest.

" Bitcoin price retested the USD 6,450 support area recently and later bounced back. However, the BTC/USD pair is still trading below the USD 6,500 resistance area with a bearish angle. The price made many lower highs and struggled to gain momentum for a break above the USD 6,500 and USD 6,550 resistance levels. Similarly, ethereum price is stuck in a tight range above the USD 200 support and it is struggling to surpass the USD 208 and USD 210 resistance levels.  Total market capitalization  Buyers defended the USD 6,450 support area in bitcoin price  once again. BTC/USD recovered and it is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) trading near the USD 6,475 level. On the upside, the most important resistance is at USD 6,500, above which the price could head towards the next key resistance at USD 6,550.
The current price action indicates that the price is trading in a tight range above the USD 6,400 and USD 6,450 support levels. If there is a break below USD 6,400, bitcoin could decline sharply in the near term. Ethereum price  found a strong buying interest near the USD 200 support once again. ETH/USD recovered a couple of points, but it is still struggling to clear the USD 205, USD 208 and USD 210 resistance levels.
On the other hand, if sellers manage to clear the USD 200 support, the price may perhaps come under a lot of selling pressure. The next support in the mentioned case could be USD 185. Bitcoin cash price  is stuck in a USD 20 range. BCH/USD is facing a solid resistance near the USD 450 - USD 460 zone, and on the downside, there is a major support near the USD 430 level. If the price settles above the USD 450 and USD 460 resistance levels, it could rise sharply towards the USD 500 level.
Ripple price  failed to clear the USD 0.470 resistance and started a downside move. The XRP/USD pair tested the USD 0.450 support and it is currently consolidating near USD 0.455 for the next move. Today, a few altcoins gained more than 8%, including RVN, MGO, ETP, VERI, STRAT and NEXO. Out of these, RVN rallied more than 15% and MGO was up roughly 13%. To sum up, bitcoin price remains confined in a tiny range above the USD 6,450 support. BTC/USD must break the USD 6,500 and USD 6,550 resistance levels. If buyers continue to fail, there is a risk of a sharp downside break towards the USD 6,200 level. Similarly, ethereum price could nosedive if it continues to fail near the USD 208 and USD 210 resistance levels.

" If you wonder how Bitcoin mining would go, but can’t afford to start, there is now a simulator to show you how it works.  Made by Reddit user u/BTCGamer, the game lets you buy rigs, fans, research better ones, expand your space, etc. Published on Newgrounds, the online community for entertainment including gaming, filming, audio and artwork composition, the game has close to 50,000 views as of the time of writing. You start out with a small room that consists of six desks and 0.08 BTC. For now, you can only afford a desktop from Bell Computers that generates 0.01 BTC per minute and doesn’t use electricity. Once you make enough money, you can buy a 6 GPU Custom Mining Rig for 0.3 BTC and install it on the second table. It generates 0.3 BTC per minute and doesn’t use electricity either. Rigs can be overclocked (by making them ""run faster"" than originally intended), making them generate more BTC, but you can only overclock one rig. From then on, you keep the game open and wait until you generate enough bitcoins to “research” new miners to improve the amount of BTC earned per minute. Keep in mind that most of these do use electricity, though, and the cost will be automatically deducted from your in-game balance. All miners generate heat as well - how much depends on the rig itself. Overheating the room makes you lose the game, so invest in coolers as well! The visuals of the game are very rudimentary, and the music may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but it can be turned off. However, it is the product of a single person, so expectations should be low to begin with. The creator also takes everyone’s criticisms into account and adds features according to that. Although there is practically no replayability value, the game is a great insight into how mining works - and how boring it is most of the time. It has a score of 3.58 out of 5 on Newgrounds, and 179 people added it to their Faves. On social network Reddit, the game received pretty positive acclaim, where one user even mined more than 21 million - a significant amount of time spent in the game, at the very least. It’s no Witcher 3, GTA V or Skyrim, but for all of you who want to learn more about crypto mining, check it out!",2018-10-24
" Bitcoin price tested the key USD 6,450 support area and later recovered. BTC/USD moved higher and traded above the USD 6,500 resistance, but gains were limited.

On the downside, the price could decline towards the USD 6,480 level if it fails to hold the USD 6,500 support. Any further losses may perhaps push the price back towards the USD 6,450 support area. Ethereum price  slowly recovered and broke the USD 205 resistance. However, ETH/USD failed to gain momentum above USD 205 and the pair is currently consolidating near USD 204.
On the downside, an initial support is near the USD 202 level, followed by the key USD 200 support. To the topside, the price has to break the USD 208 and USD 210 levels to stage a decent rebound.

" Cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity fast in Colombia – with developments coming apace in the field of commerce, education and overseas investment. Activity on LocalBitcoins, a peer-to-peer bitcoin marketplace, just reached new all-time heights with BTC 350 traded last week.  Meanwhile, the Dash cryptocurrency, which recently reported that it had signed up “more than 100 new Dash merchants in Colombia in the last three months,” this week announced that it was allocating some USD 300,000 worth of funds for growth projects in Colombia and neighboring Venezuela. Dash is thought to have a total of almost 29 communities in the two countries. Also, DiarioBitcoin reports that a large, newly formed community of Colombian cryptocurrency miners and blockchain companies named FEDE-MINERS wants to petition the government to deregulate mining and convince lawmakers to consider the financial and technological benefits of pro-blockchain policies. Although the Colombian government is currently mulling the introduction of crypto-specific taxes and regulations, while the country’s biggest exchange has been hit with a banking freeze-out, recently elected president Iván Duque Márquez, is known to be an avid fintech enthusiast, and has spoken favorably about cryptocurrency usage in the past. Moreover, the country’s biggest university, the National University of Colombia, has announced that it has begun a month-long “blockchain and cryptocurrencies” introductory course, which runs until late November this year, and is open to members of the general public.

" Bitcoin price remained confined in a tiny range above the USD 6,400 support area. BTC/USD seems to be struggling to clear the USD 6,500 and USD 6,550 resistance levels. Similarly, ethereum price is holding the USD 200 support, but it is facing a lot of offers near the USD 208 and USD 210 levels. Other major altcoins like bitcoin cash and ripple also faced an increased selling pressure as they declined below key supports. Going forward, there could be more range moves in the crypto market before the next major move. Total market capitalization  Buyers struggled to gain momentum, resulting in a few bearish moves in bitcoin price  below the USD 6,500 support. BTC/USD settled below the USD 6,500 support level, which is now acting as a resistance. Above this, the next major hurdle for buyers is near the USD 6,550 level. To move into a positive zone, the price has to surpass the USD 6,600 resistance.
On the downside, an initial support is near the USD 6,450 level, below which the price may decline towards the USD 6,400 support area. Any further losses will most likely put sellers in full control in the short term. Ethereum price  tested the USD 200 support area and it is currently consolidating losses. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the USD 208 level, above which the key resistance is at USD 215.
On the flip side, if sellers push the price below the USD 200 support, then there could be a sharp sell-off in ETH/USD. In the mentioned case, the price may possibly test the USD 185 level. Bitcoin cash price  attempted a recovery above the USD 450 level, but it failed to gain bullish momentum. BCH/USD declined and traded below the USD 450 support. The next key support is at USD 440, below which the price may decline to USD 425.
Ripple price  failed to hold gains above the main USD 0.450 support. XRP/USD is currently down around 1% and it is likely heading towards the USD 0.440 support area. On the upside, resistances are at USD 0.452 and USD 0.460. A few altcoins rallied today by more than 1%, including LINK, DCR, POLY and MOAC. Out of these, LINK gained around 26% and DCR was up around 25%. Overall, bitcoin price is slowly moving lower towards the USD 6,400 support area, which holds the key in the near term. To recover, the price must settle above the USD 6,550 level and then clear USD 6,600. If not, there is a risk of more declines in BTC/USD and altcoins in the coming sessions.

" Two significant news rocked the crypto world: first, major cryptocurrency exchange Binance just received an investment from the Singaporean government, and second, new Bitcoin futures are set to hit the market in December. Binance has received an undisclosed amount from Vertex Ventures, the venture capital arm of government-owned investment company Temasek Holdings Pte from Singapore. The investment is set to boost Binance’s plans to allow users of their platform to trade crypto for the Singaporean dollar and vice versa. The platform only recently started testing fiat to crypto transactions in Uganda, as they opened a chapter of their company there. Meanwhile, Bakkt, a heavyweight crypto platform launched by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, will start clearing Bitcoin futures on December 12th. According to the ICE-issued document revealing the details of these news, the “physical” Bitcoin backing the futures contract will be held in a so-called “digital asset warehouse” that was created by Bakkt and ICE in a collaborative effort. As pointed out by Joseph Young, a cryptocurrency reporter and analyst, Bakkt’s upcoming arrival could likely catalyze thousands of traders to invest in this space and may even persuade the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to reconsider their position on this market.  It will For those who don’t see what the big deal about institutional investors’ support for crypto is, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, offered an explanation. He asked on Twitter, “What happens when a fund like Fidelity allocates a mere 5 percent of their portfolio to crypto?

" The volatility of the bitcoin price is now nearly as low as shares of tech giant Apple, the world’s biggest company by market capitalization,  according to new data released by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).  As most traders are aware, the stock market has generally been considered far less volatile, and less risky, than the crypto market. However, this belief is now being put into question as a result of unusually stable prices for the number one cryptocurrency. The CBOE data showed that bitcoin’s 20-day historical volatility has fallen to 31.5%, lower than that of well-established publicly traded companies like Amazon, an e-commerce giant, and Netflix.  20-day Historical Volatility “A one standard deviation move for bitcoin is about USD 475. That works out to +/- 7.3% […],” Kevin Davitt, a senior instructor for the Options Institute at CBOE, was quoted as saying by Marketwatch. According to him, in mid-January, “the standard deviation measured $4,640 or +/- 42%.” A standard deviation in a market is a measure of how often a certain move in prices can be expected to occur on average. Following a normal distribution, 68% of all moves are within +/- 1 standard deviation. Although low volatility represents a challenge for active traders, long-term holders and bitcoin enthusiasts see it as a positive development for the digital asset, bringing it closer to the vision of it becoming “digital gold.” “Perhaps we are witnessing the maturation of a market. It’s far too early to declare this the ‘new normal’ but the persistent range over the last few weeks may be hinting at a structural shift,” CBOE’s Davitt concluded. Other experts have also suggested that the recently low volatility of the bitcoin market could be a sign that the market is maturing. Earlier this month, Gil Luria, research director at wealth management firm D.A. Davidson & Co., hinted that there is less speculation in the bitcoin economy today. “When speculators are involved, they drive unusually high volumes as well as volatility by trading the asset with high frequency. As speculator involvement is diminished, volumes go down and volatility goes down as well,” Luria said at the time.",2018-10-23
" As November is approaching and Bitcoin price is stuck in a crucial range, the cryptoverse is increasingly debating what will the next month bring this time. Tom Lee, Wall Street market analyst and Bitcoin bull, remains convinced that Bitcoin could still surpass USD 20,000 - even in spite of the year-long bear market. In an interview with Heidi “BlockchainChick,” a crypto influencer, he said that “people are too bearish” and that there is still time for his prediction to come true. The head of Fundstrat Global Advisors, a market analyst company, explained: “What happens is, people get bearish because it makes sense. I mean, market’s been terrible and we’re below 200-day [moving average] and we [at Fundstrat] published a report this week that pointed out to our clients that when Bitcoin is under its 200-day, it only goes up 50% of the time in the next six months. But when it’s above its 200-day, it is up 80% of the time, so the trend implied by the 200-day is obviously very important.” He still stands by his USD 20,000 prophecy: according to Fundstrat’s research, by year’s end, the break-even cost of mining bitcoin will rise to USD 8,000 - USD 9,000. According to the analyst, bitcoin often trades at over two times its break-even - and sometimes even three to four times the number - so Lee doesn’t consider his price prediction all that bullish in the first place. However, there is still a big question in the air: what’s the bottom? “Until people are convinced that there’s a bottom, like there are a chicken and an egg, you can’t motivate people until the [bottoming] event happens,” he adds. A recent informal poll by Fundstrat indicated that the usually very cautious Wall Street investors are now overwhelmingly calling a bottom in the bitcoin market. Twitter users, however, are still skeptical, with a majority saying bitcoin still has room to fall. Meanwhile, Lee is not the only one who believes the end of the year could bring respite from the market red. The cryptocurrency community on Reddit, a social network site, had one user reappropriate a quote from Benjamin Franklin: “In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes,” and u/ideaDash adds, “Crypto November.” There are those who believe that Bakkt could turn the market bullish, while others maintain that Novembers in previous years constitute no guarantee for a bull run.  The community forgets a single truth, however, spoken in 1991 by Guns N’ Roses: “Nothin' lasts forever / And we both know hearts can change / And it's hard to hold a candle / In the cold November rain.” Maybe Axl didn’t originally mean a crypto candle, but possibly he’s revised his opinion by now.

" A new chart from the quantitative cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo sheds light on some of the developments seen in the bitcoin market this year, with network activity increasing even as bitcoin prices have plummeted. However, not everyone agrees with the analyst.  In the chart, posted to Twitter on Friday, Willy Woo showed that the Bitcoin blockchain blocks reached 95% of capacity last week. Meanwhile no noticeable change has been recorded in the transaction fees required to successfully make a payment on the network. As of Monday morning, average transaction fees on the Bitcoin network stood at around USD 0.36, per data from blockchain analytics company Blockchain. Meanwhile... during the bear market no less... Bitcoin's blocks peak above 95% full without anyone noticing, the fees and confirm times remain nominal. Bitcoin of 2018 is not Bitcoin of 2017. The protocol is quietly improving. pic.twitter.com/ZgtpBnQFbJ The chart from Woo supposedly illustrates that despite higher levels of network congestion today compared to last year, transaction fees today remain normal and well under the levels from last year. However, other cryptocurrency experts such as Alan Silbert, executive managing director at INX Limited, an owner and operator of a platform for trading blockchain assets and their derivatives, and Adam Back, founder and CEO of Blockstream, a blockchain startup, have something to add: Good point, and also because of the weighting the backwards compatible serialisation of base blocks (removing the signatures for old nodes) will never reach 1MB so it becomes artificial. even though the full block is 2.2MB -- because the weighting rule is that body + sig/4 < 1MB. At the time of writing, the discussion between the three is not over yet. Meanwhile, some other members of the cryptoverse have also shared their opinions on the matter: It's obvious what happens. As tx volume increases it will bump into the limit leading to a supply constraint, spike in the mempool, and increased fees. _____ Check your math/logic.  Last bull run block usage went up about 25% (800K-->1M). But capacity is now 100% to 200% higher than before.  So there will be no delays and fees will not go up much, if at all. No matter who is right, Bitcoin still lags far behind traditional alternatives like Visa or MasterCard in terms of the number of transactions per second (TPS) it can handle.  With current capacity, the Bitcoin network is able to process about 7 TPS. That compares to Visa’s payments network, which is able to handle more than 24,000 TPS. As Pantera Capital’s co-CIO Joey Krug reiterated in an interview last week, the cryptocurrencies of today can be compared to “the Internet before dial-up,” where they are not scalable. He went on to say that this is the first thing that needs to be solved in order for cryptocurrencies to enter the next bull phase and gain mainstream adoption.",2018-10-22
" A court in Russia has ordered an Evangelical church to pay a bill of USD 16,000 for mining cryptocurrencies. In a civil case, the Court of Arbitration in Irkutsk ruled in favor of local energy provider Irkutskenegro, who had alleged that the church, Grace, began using an inordinately high quantity of electricity in May 2017 – and had billed the religious group accordingly. Energy is highly subsidized in Russia, and Irkutsk residents enjoy some of the lowest power prices on the planet. However, energy providers only offer subsidized rates to residential and non-industrial users. Illicit miners, say providers in the country, can be charged retrospectively with industrial rates. Per Interfax and FTimes, Grace had disputed the provider’s charge, and denied that it was using electricity for Bitcoin mining – instead claiming that in May last year, the church had installed several printers to “produce religious literature.” However, the court heard that local printers in fact used just a small fraction of the energy Grace had used in the same period. Irkutskenegro stated that the church had consumed a whopping 2 million kW/h in May to August 2017. This is not the only surprising instance of an unauthorized cryptocurrency mining in Russia. On February 9, 2018, scientists at a Russian nuclear center were arrested for the offense of using resources at the center to mine cryptocurrencies.  Also, the case bears similarities to that of a Cherepovets resident who was found to have kitted out an otherwise-empty apartment with mining rigs – and was later ordered to pay similar charges. Meanwhile, Russian parliamentarians have appeared to backtrack on plans to include a definition of cryptocurrency mining in a long-awaited package of crypto-specific legislation. As previously reported, the head of the committee overseeing the bills earlier this month stated that cryptocurrency mining would be defined so that miners could be taxed, although “cryptocurrency” and similar terms would not be given legal definition. The move led to major criticism from fintech, law and IT experts in the country. Per Interfax, the committee now says it plans to remove all mention of crypto mining from the bills to avoid mentioning cryptocurrencies at all – although the government still plans to tax crypto miners for their “entrepreneurial activities.” Critics in the country have argued that this latest decision simply muddies the issue yet further. The bills have already passed their first hearing, and were slated to have been given a second and final reading by the end of October – a deadline that it seems lawmakers will now struggle to meet.",2018-10-22
" The deadline for filing a rehabilitation claim with the infamous Mt. Gox exchange is rapidly approaching; claimants have until Monday, October 22nd to send proof of being a victim in the exchange’s hack.  Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee of the exchange opened up the process in August as part of its civil rehabilitation process. A separate Q&A document, published in August, says that, “The planned deadline for the Rehabilitation Trustee to submit a statement of approval or rejection to the court is January 24, 2019, but, at the current point in time, a definite date has not been determined.” There has been no update on this situation as of right now. However, according to a Reddit post on the topic, during a Q&A session of the creditors meeting on September 26th Kobayashi confirmed that he is going ahead with self-admission of claims. These so-called zombie claims mean that if the trustee is aware of anyone who should have a claim, he will file a claim on their behalf. In other words, anyone that had an account on Mt. Gox and appears on their database, even with just a few dollars or satoshis on the exchange, will have a claim filed in their name. However, if the funds are unclaimed after a certain amount of time, it will pass to the Japanese treasury. According to reports, there are about 75.000 small accounts that make up about 10% to 20% of total claim value. ""In practice this means a reduction of claim value for BTC claimants, and the Japanese government benefiting. Our group (mtgoxlegal.com) are currently fundraising to keep our lawyer on this,"" the post reads. However, there is no official announcement regarding the ""zombie claims."" The road to recovery has not been completely smooth to all claimants, however. In a subreddit dedicated to the legal proceedings of Mt. Gox, many users complain that the call center is hard to reach, even during business hours, and that the process itself is confusing.  The community also speculates that the payout should happen around summer to fall 2019. Reddit user u/Btc_Hawker said they were attending the previous creditors’ meeting on September 26th, and writes, “[I] will be asking the trustee to pay out an interim distribution of all the cash owed to depositors and the vast bulk of the Bitcoin in February. There is no justification for further delay once civil rehabilitation is approved.” The user did not further update on this. The next Mt. Gox creditors’ meeting is set for March 20th, 2019. Before that, the period to examine Proofs of rehabilitation claims is set from January 31st to February 7th, 2019.  Launched in July 2010, by 2013 and into 2014 Mt.

BTC/USD declined below the USD 6,550 level and later broke the USD 6,500 support to move into a short term bearish zone. Similarly, ethereum price failed to stay above the USD 205 support and it seems like the USD 200 support is currently (UTC 08:00 AM) at risk. The current price action is indicating an increase in selling pressure on bitcoin and altcoins, which may result in additional weakness in the next two sessions. Total market capitalization  There was no recovery above the USD 6,600 resistance in bitcoin price . BTC/USD started a fresh decline and broke the key USD 6,500 support. It tested the USD 6,450 support, but it seems like there are possibilities of more losses.
The next major support on the downside is at USD 6,400, below which bitcoin buyers may come under a lot of pressure. On the upside, the previous support at USD 6,500 is now a major resistance. Above USD 6,500, the main hurdle for buyers to take control is at USD 6,600. Ethereum price  also declined further and broke the USD 205 support. ETH/USD traded close to the USD 200 support and it is currently consolidating losses.
If the price settles below the USD 200 support, there could be heavy declines towards the USD 180 level in the near term.

" The Armenian government has presided over the opening of what it claims is one of the biggest cryptocurrency mining farms in the world. At a ceremony in the capital, Yerevan, acting Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan was joined by the head of the consortium that has constructed the farm, Armenian billionaire (and so-called oligarch) Gagik Tsarukyan. Per news outlet Yerkramas, Tsarukyan claims that the farm, which is the brainchild of his Multi Group conglomerate, cost some USD 50 million to construct, and has been equipped with an initial 3,000 mining rigs. The company is planning to expand that number to 12,000 in the near future. The farm will initially mine Bitcoin and Ethereum. Yerkramas states that the facility is based on two floors: the ground floor is a business and management center, with an entire floor given over to servers and equipment above. The media outlet says that Tsarukyan and Pashinyan – who tendered his resignation from his post two days ago in a bid to call snap elections – were joined by business leaders from China, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates and “a number of other countries” for the opening ceremony. Tsarukyan is quoted as saying, “Guests are coming to Armenia from almost 40 countries [to see the mine]. This is an important step towards the development of the information technology sector in Armenia, especially since representatives of foreign business circles are planning to meet with members of the government to discover more about the possibilities of making new, larger investments in the Armenian economy.” The farm will initially receive some 50MW of power from a thermal energy plant, with “an agreement in place” to provide an increase in capacity to 200MW, per Armenpress. Watch this video from the opening of the farm: Earlier this year, the country’s government legalized mining in anticipation of the farm’s opening, although cryptocurrency trading remains illegal in Armenia.

" The crypto industry just used an old way to reach masses: invite a TV star, make a funny video and hope it will go viral. And this time it really did went viral, spreading the word about the world of cryptocurrencies: almost 2.5 million views on YouTube and Twitter in less than two days. eToro, a multi-asset platform which offers both investing in stocks and cryptocurrencies, released an ad featuring actor Kristian Nairn, better known as the character Hodor from the record-breaking TV series Game of Thrones.  Kristian Nairn portrays the beloved character Hodor, the simple-minded servant of a noble house in the TV show Game of Thrones, who can only say the word Hodor which, in turn, gave him the name. The character spends a significant amount of time carrying a young boy on his back in the show, communicating only with that one word, which is derived from the phrase ""hold the door"".  The ad follows the actor listening to offers for advertisements in which he always carries something on his back and says “Hodor.” Tired of being pigeonholed, he tells his agent to find him something “with a tie”. Well, the result is below: The community went absolutely wild over the advertisement. Nairn’s character was universally beloved - the episode featuring a significant plot twist involving Hodor’s past and future which brought fans to tears has been universally acclaimed as well as receiving a 100% rating from review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. The choice of character, the play on words and the simple message of the ad had fans in a frenzy. “Thanks @eToro for proving that advertisements can be funny again,” writes Twitter user @FleitzPierre, while user @CryptoPoland adds, “A serious actor who reminds us the ads can be more engaging, funny and enjoyable, all at the same time.” Other people are finding more easter eggs in the ad: “Anyone else notice the elevator buttons? Moon or Rekt,” writes Reddit user u/jaynemesis. Then, there are those speculating on other characters of the show and the ways they’re leveraging the world’s economy to serve their own goals… But that does not really have much to do with Hodor. The platform might well have struck gold with this ad in terms of the future of crypto advertising: integrating terms unique to the cryptoverse into pop culture could serve to familiarize wider audiences with the industry.

" A murder in Norway, even if it’s not related to a bitcoin trade that took place before the killing happened, comes as a reminder to be extra careful when buying or selling bitcoin in person.   A 24-year-old man who was found dead in his apartment in Oslo, Norway on Monday morning, had earlier sold bitcoins to another person for cash, according to Norwegian broadcaster TV2.  The victim reportedly brought the large sum of money back to his apartment, where he was later found stabbed to death. It is unclear exactly when the bitcoin trade took place. “We are aware of a tip relating to bitcoin, but we do not wish to elaborate on it at this stage of the investigation,” Grete Lien Metlid, head of the intelligence and investigations unit at the Oslo Police Department, told TV2. According to sources who spoke with TV2, several of the victim’s friends were aware that he stored a large amount of money in cash in his apartment, located in one of Oslo’s best neighbourhoods, after the bitcoin sale. After failing to show up for work Monday morning, the victim was found dead by one of his roommates at 12:15 the same day. Before that, he was last seen on Sunday night as everyone who lived in the apartment were preparing to go to sleep. It remains a mystery how the murderer got into the apartment and carried out the crime without waking up any of the other roommates. As of press time, forensic analysts were still working on the crime scene. No arrests have yet been made in the case, nor does the police have any suspects. Since the beginning of the year, there was a number of violent attacks on individuals who hold a substantial amount of cryptocurrency.

" Trading in bitcoin futures contracts continue to gain popularity among speculators in the US futures market, according to recently released figures from futures marketplace CME Group.   During the third quarter this year, the exchange saw an average daily trading volume of 5,053 bitcoin futures contracts. On CME’s market, each bitcoin contract represents 5 bitcoins, which means that contracts worth a total of 25,265 BTC (USD 163 million) changed hands every trading day. Trading volume rose by 41% since last quarter, in what has been a fairly constant rate of increase since bitcoin futures were first introduced on the CME exchange in December 2017. In Q3, Bitcoin futures average daily volume rose 41% and open interest was up 19% over Q2 . Learn how market participants are using BTC to manage risk in changing markets. https://t.co/Yt41SzsHku pic.twitter.com/Kw4OX0QaKT Meanwhile, so-called open interest, meaning the amount of new money that is flowing into the market, also increased by 19% since the last quarter. Generally, increasing open interest is seen as a sign that market participants are taking a greater interest in a market, strengthening the already existing price movements.  In the case of the bitcoin market, this could mean that the current “range-bound” pattern in the market is being reinforced by trading taking place in the futures market. The introduction of bitcoin futures trading on CME Group’s exchange on December 17, 2017 coincided with the peak in bitcoin prices last year, when bitcoin hit nearly USD 20,000 on several cryptocurrency exchanges. Trading on CME’s market followed the launch of the first-ever bitcoin futures market on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) one week earlier.  However, futures were blamed for Bitcoin’s fall from its peak.  “The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence.

" Increased scalability of cryptocurrencies is needed before the next run-up in prices, but when that happens the market to increase “10x from here”,  according to Joey Krug, Pantera Capital’s co-chief investment officer. In an interview with Bloomberg he also said that the market has already hit its bottom this year. Krug further compared the most recent bull market to the current market, saying that news about early adoption by some institutions sparked a surge in speculative investments two years ago. This time around, however, he believes the market is waiting for more “actual adoption” of digital assets, and decentralized applications (dapps) in particular. He went on to compare the current state of dapps to “the Internet before dial-up,” where they are not scalable, and people are not using them for that reason, hinting that this is the first thing that needs to be solved. Although Joey Krug and Pantera Capital, a crypto investment firm and hedge fund, remain very optimistic about crypto over the long-term, Krug did warn that prices could continue in their current “range-bound” pattern for a while.  When asked if it is right that he doesn’t believe the market will rebound for the next two years until scalability is solved, Krug answered that “we could see a rebound before then, but I think that’s gonna be the real catalyst that drives the next huge bull-run in my opinion.” In August, Pantera announced that it is looking to raise up to USD 175 million for its third venture fund. This is a significant jump from its previous ones, as their second one was USD 25 million, whereas its debut deployed USD 13 million back in 2013.

" German Bitcoin enthusiast Matthias Steinig has created an e-bike that accepts payments through Lightning Network. The bike is a pretty standard model, with an electronic conversion kit retrofitted. The battery for the e-bike powers a Raspberry Pi controller with an e-Ink display to keep power consumption low - as the creator says that the biggest drain on power is the USB modem/network card necessary for Lightning communication. Both on his GitHub, a software development platform, and in a tweeted video, Steinig explains how to use the bike: “You select on the display how long you want to drive, get a QR code that you scan and pay for with your Lightning mobile app, after that the power for the selected period is turned on. The special about this system, it's mobile, the communication is realized via the mobile network and the power comes from the battery of the e-bike.” The video in his tweet shows the practical side of this. The bike charges 250 satoshis (BTC 0.00000250 or USD 0.016) per minute, and once the QR code is generated, you have 60 seconds to pay using your Lightning app. Once the payment is made, the system powers on and you’re free to ride around for the selected time. As Steinig explains, “After the end of the paid time, the system switches off and the power supply is interrupted - of course you can continue driving, but only with muscle power.” Hey, here's the promised video of using the lightning-bike, hope you like it! pic.twitter.com/ul2gBXc2id While the community likes the innovation, it would be a surprise if people didn’t crack a few jokes on the topic. “Looks on-chain to me,” says Reddit user u/kattbilder. “Proof of cables,” tweeted user @milancheck. Others point out that this is still very much only Proof of Concept: for example, the controller only limits access to the e-bike functionality. At the end of your time period, or indeed without using the Lightning Network payment system at all, you can still ride off with the bike using pedal power. Still, there are those that see the silver lining. As Twitter user @barryhackamac says, “Would be so nice to use this as a tourist and not have to set up some locally specific app with foreign exchange commissions etc.” User @daggeroflight11 tweets, “It’s things like this that will bring mass adoption. Not ETFs. Not Wall Street. Smart motivated people finding use cases and running with them. Great work!” Meanwhile, smart and motivated people are building other great things that might help cryptocurrency adoption. For example, in September, a group of developers have completed the first off-grid cryptocurrency transaction using blockchain and shortwave radios as well as solar power. In other words, they have found a way to send crypto in times of disasters.",2018-10-16
" After a massive rally yesterday, bitcoin price retreated from well above USD 6,800 and traded below the USD 6,700 and USD 6,600 support levels. However, BTC/USD found support near the USD 6,500 zone and is currently consolidating near the USD 6,600 level. Similarly, ethereum price declined sharply and tested the USD 205 support. Other altcoins like ripple and bitcoin cash price are trading above key support levels and they could slowly grind higher in the near term. Total market capitalization  After a downside correction, bitcoin price  found a strong buying interest near the USD 6,550 level. BTC/USD recovered above the USD 6,600 level and it is currently struggling to clear the USD 6,640 resistance. Above this, the next major hurdle for buyers is near the USD 6,700 level.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 6,550, below which the price could test the USD 6,500 support. In case there are more declines, the price will most likely revisit the USD 6,400 support, which is a strong barrier for sellers. Ethereum price  trimmed most gains and declined below the USD 215 support. ETH/USD tested the next key support at USD 205, which prevented further slides.
The price is currently consolidating with an immediate resistance at USD 210. Above this, the price may well test the USD 215 resistance. On the downside, the USD 205 and USD 200 levels are important supports for buyers. Bitcoin cash price  is currently trading above the USD 450 support with a bullish angle. However, BCH/USD seems to be struggling to clear the USD 470 and USD 480 resistances. If there is a bearish reaction, the price could break the USD 450 support. The next key support is positioned at USD 430.
Ripple price  traded with a positive bias above the USD 0.450 level. XRP/USD is positioned nicely above the USD 0.450 and USD 0.440 supports, and it seems like the price is likely to accelerate above the USD 0.465 resistance in the near term. A few altcoins traded higher recently, including AOA, DGD, BCN, XTZ, ICX, KNC and HOT. Out of these aurora (AOA) rallied more than 20% and DGD gained around 17%. Overall, bitcoin price is still holding the key support at USD 6,400, which is a positive sign. Therefore, as long as BTC/USD is above USD 6,500 and USD 6,400, there are high possibilities of a fresh upward move towards USD 6,700 or USD 6,800 in the coming sessions. Similarly, ETH/USD could rise towards USD 215 or USD 220 as long as it is above the USD 200 support.

" The nascent market of cryptocurrencies just received even more news to think about.  After reports that the major player in the crypto industry Coinbase failed to predict demand from large investors, and banking giant Barclays reportedly halted work on a cryptocurrency trading project, the market has received two positive news.  The fourth largest asset manager with USD 7.2 trillion in assets under management, the US-based Fidelity Investments has announced that it is launching a new company aimed at financial institutions that want to trade and store digital assets. Meanwhile in Japan, the world’s first public offering of a crypto-focused investment fund is set to go live.  The new company, dubbed Fidelity Digital Assets, will offer much-needed institutional custody services in “offline, vaulted deep-cold storage,” which could be just what many some of the bigger players on Wall Street have been waiting for before taking the leap into crypto, and offering it as a mainstream asset class to their clients. ""<..>Fidelity was seeing a steady increase in calls from large financial institutions regarding the company’s plans for handling digital assets, specifically with respect to custody and executional services,” the company said in a blog post, adding that “Institutional interest in digital assets is expanding, and these organizations require sophisticated capabilities in order to proceed.” According to former Wall Street banker-turned crypto entrepreneur Mike Novogratz, Fidelity Digital Assets will work with his company Galaxy Digital as its “alpha crypto custody client” going forward: Exciting news.  We are thrilled to  announce #GalaxyDigital as @Fidelity @DigitalAssets’ alpha crypto custody client #theherdiscoming https://t.co/87yeysYSFM Fidelity, which has over 70 years of experience in the financial services industry, will provide custody solutions to large trading firms that operates in the huge over-the-counter (OTC) market for cryptocurrencies. Fidelity Digital Assets reportedly has a staff of 100 people, and is led by Tom Jessop, a former Goldman Sachs managing director and president at tech startup Chain.  “Someone like Fidelity coming into this market we think will have a positive effect on the whole market,” Jessop was quoted as saying in a media statement.
____ Tom Jessop sits down with Bloomberg's Erik Schatzker to discuss Fidelity's new business to manage digital assets for hedge funds, family offices and trading firms: Arianna Simpson, managing director at crypto-focused venture capital fund Autonomous Partners, reacted to news: The Fidelity news is huge. Don’t you see what is happening?! What an extraordinary moment in time. Back in June, several media outlets reported that Fidelity was secretly working on setting up its own cryptocurrency exchange, largely based on reports that the veteran financial firm was actively hiring engineers for its new project. The job posting reportedly read that the engineers would be needed “to help engineer, create and deploy a Digital Asset exchange to both a public and private cloud.” Subscriptions for the new retail-oriented fund, dubbed Epoch Digital Assets, were opened on October 15, and are to be capped at 100 billion yen, or about USD 900 million, per a press release from the company. It claims that it's world's first public offering of a cryptocurrency and digital assets related fund. The new fund will reportedly operate in a hedge fund-like manner, investing in other funds, initial coin offerings (ICOs), and directly in digital assets, in an effort to smooth out the wild swings that the crypto market is known for, while still aiming to reap the rewards.  “We were very keen to undertake the world's first public offering of a cryptocurrency fund in Japan and look forward to great things ahead […] In the future, digital assets are likely to become an integrated part of investment portfolios, similar to equities and fixed income products today, albeit on a smaller scale,” Epoch partner James Skinner said in a statement. Meanwhile, in a separate announcement, heavyweight crypto platform Bakkt said that its exchange and clearing house boards — and the clearing house risk committee — ”have all reviewed and approved the respective rules” and will file these rules publicly with the the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for review and comment “very soon.”  “We’re taking a transparent approach to engage across the industry as we begin testing and onboarding in November, and trading and warehousing in December, subject to CFTC approval,” Kelly Loeffler, CEO of Bakkt, said.",2018-10-16
" Following the strong run-up in bitcoin prices yesterday, traders may now be eyeing another opportunity for further growth as the short trade is getting unusually crowded for the number one cryptocurrency.  In what appears to be short-term traders positioning themselves for a further sell-off in bitcoin on the Bitfinex exchange, the ratio of short-to-long orders on the exchange reached 1.54 during the Asian trading session Tuesday morning, a level not seen since November last year. Short-selling essentially involves speculating on lower prices in a market by borrowing an asset that a trader doesn’t currently own in order to sell it in the market. The asset can then be bought back at a lower price later, allowing the short-seller to profit from the difference between the selling price and the buying price. While a high number of sellers in a market is generally considered a bad sign, it also opens up opportunities when it reaches extreme levels. This is what is known as a short-squeeze, and it is something we have seen repeatedly this year as the short-to-long ratio has hit the high levels we are at now. 
If the market starts to move upwards in the near future, many of the short-sellers will exit their short positions by buying back bitcoins in the open market. As the price moves further up, even more short-sellers will get margin calls or hit their pre-set stop-loss levels, forcing them to cover their shorts, and creating a self-reinforcing mechanism that can cause sharp price increases. Whether this will happen again this time, however, still remains unclear. Another possible explanation is that there is a significant amount of arbitrage going on right now centered on the Bitfinex exchange, following the surge in the bitcoin price yesterday that brought the price on Bitfinex to nearly USD 7,800 at its peak. That was close to USD 1,000 higher than on other exchanges like Coinbase, where bitcoin reached a high of about USD 6,800 yesterday.  An obvious way for traders to take advantage of a situation like that is to short-sell bitcoin on Bitfinex, while buying bitcoin on Coinbase or another exchange. That way, a trader would be profiting as the price gap between the exchanges closes. The bitcoin price was nearly unchanged across exchanges on Tuesday morning, and still remains significantly higher on Bitfinex than on other exchanges, which many in the community attributes to speculation and fear about the status of the popular stablecoin Tether. Price differences at exchanges: ",2018-10-16
" Bitcoin price gained bullish momentum against the US Dollar and Tether (USDT) during the past few hours (UTC 08:20 AM). There was a sharp upward move in BTC/USDT above the USD 7,500 level due to a nasty slide in Tether below the USD 0.950 support. BTC/USD also gained traction and surged above the USD 6,500 and USD 6,700 resistance levels. However, buyers failed to hold gains and bitcoin price reversed most of its gains. BTC/USD is back to USD 6,600 and it is currently trading with a positive bias. Similarly, ethereum, bitcoin cash and ripple rallied recently before trimming most of their gains. Overall, the recent price spike ignited a lot of volatility in the crypto market, which could help bitcoin buyers in the short term. Total market capitalization  After testing the USD 6,200 support, bitcoin price  started an upward move. BTC/USD broke the USD 6,350 and USD 6,400 resistance levels to climb sharply higher. It even spiked above the USD 6,850 resistance, but sellers quickly reversed the bias. 
The price declined sharply and traded below the USD 6,700 level. It is currently trading near the USD 6,600 mark, with an immediate support near the USD 6,500 level. The most important support on the downside awaits at USD 6,400. On the upside, the price needs to regain the USD 6,700 level to climb back towards USD 6,800. Ethereum price  broke the USD 200 resistance zone to enter a positive area. ETH/USD climbed above the USD 205 and USD 215 resistance levels.
The price also traded above the USD 220 level, but later it declined below USD 215. It is currently up 5% to USD 211, with an immediate support at USD 210. On the upside, buyers need to settle the price above the USD 225 resistance for further gains. Bitcoin cash price  rallied above the USD 450 and 475 resistance levels during the recent upward move. BCH/USD tested the USD 490-500 resistance zone, which prevented further upsides. The price is currently down to USD 462 and it may well continue to trade lower towards the USD 450 support.
Ripple price  surged above the USD 0.450 resistance and even spiked above the USD 0.465 level. Later, XRP/USD reversed gains and it is currently trading near the USD 0.445 level. It seems like a proper close above the USD 0.450 level is needed for a larger upward move. Many altcoins gained traction and moved up between 7%-20%, including komodo, DROP, holo, bytecoin, BTG, DGD, MOAC and NPXS. Overall, the recent upward move in bitcoin price seems like a false spike, but as long as BTC/USD is holding the USD 6,400 support, it could climb higher once again. Similarly, if ETH/USD stays above the USD 210 level, the pair may possibly retest the USD 225 resistance.

" This Monday morning brought mixed feelings into the market. While major cryptocurrencies skyrocketed, investors are worried about the drop of the biggest stablecoin Tether. The top three cryptocurrencies by market cap - Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple - are were up by around 10% on Monday morning before trimming their gains to less than 7%, while the other follow suit with slightly smaller price jumps. One notable exception, however, is Tether (USDT): the stablecoin pegged to the US dollar was down to USD 0.86 before recovering to USD 0.96. Tether price chart: Bitcoin price chart: Top 10 coins by market capitalization (UTC 07:37 AM): Although the rest of the market seems like a cause for celebration, Tether’s downward plunge got the whole community worried. The biggest question: is Tether truly backed by USD? The company has yet to provide conclusive evidence of this, despite their repeated insisting that all Tethers are redeemable at USD 1. Since cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and Tether share the same CEO, speculations about the extent of their involvement with each other abound. Bitfinex has come forward with a statement that they are not insolvent only a week ago, but that “complications continue to exist for us in the domain of fiat transactions.” In the eyes of traders, the downward spiral of one could spell disaster for the other. Tether’s role as a dollar substitute has made it a huge part of the global crypto ecosystem. Playing a big part on exchanges that do not support crypto-to-fiat trading, it is easily transferable between all exchanges and other online platforms because it doesn’t have to travel through the banking system. This means Tether is the second-most actively traded cryptocurrency: it was used in more than 20% of transactions tracked by coinmarketcap.com over the past 24 hours. Vijay Ayyar, head of business development at Luno, a cryptocurrency exchange, said for Bloomberg, “If traders start to flee Tether, it’s a potentially precarious situation, since it accounts for 20% of total volumes globally. It basically implies a lot of volatility ahead.”  Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin has halted Tether deposits and withdrawals, citing “USDT wallet system maintenance” and without any information when trading may commence.  Bitfinex has news, also: Fiat deposit update - October 15th, 2018. https://t.co/F8o2ltVCN4 pic.twitter.com/ukE9JsRB0j The community is worried: on the popular social network Reddit, user u/Toyake commented, “Tether is currently trading at 91 cents, this could very well be its collapse. If Tether goes down, the whole market goes down. Get the popcorn!” In short, the community believes that people are selling Tether and buying Bitcoin.  Community reactions: The key point here is that USDT panic manifests in manic crypto-buying on Chinese exchanges (Binance, OKex, Huobi) where there are a lot of USDT holders, and of course on BitfinexThis premium in crypto is the real ""Tether panic-selling"", not the /USD pairs on Kraken/Bittrex ______ Well, this is a nice and exciting way to end all that boring sideways.Won't need coffee this morning. ______ There's indeed a big difference between Tether Exchanges and normal exchanges.However, on normal exchanges we're also breaking the downtrend as we speak and the price is there $6,600.I'm not scared about the USDT situation, I'm happy with the upwards movements. $BTC pic.twitter.com/Btz7J824xv ______ If this is a true bank run on $usdt, I would not be surprised if exchanges that have exposure to #Tether halted trading.Would that be positive for $BTCUSD?

" Bitcoin price saw heavy downsides recently as it broke the USD 6,400 and USD 6,350 support levels. BTC/USD tested the USD 6,200 support where buyers emerged, and later an upside correction was initiated. Major altcoins like ethereum and ripple also started and an upside correction after forming a decent support base. However, the current recovery may not last long since the market sentiment is still bearish, and the previous supports will most likely act as resistances. Total market capitalization  After testing the USD 6,200 support, bitcoin price  started an upside correction. BTC/USD moved above the USD 6,250 and USD 6,300 resistance levels. However, the price is facing a few important resistances near the USD 6,380, USD 6,400 and USD 6,450 levels.
The mentioned resistances near USD 6,400 were supports earlier and now they are likely to cap upsides. On the downside, a proper close below the USD 6,200 support could increase selling pressure on bitcoin it the near term. Ethereum price  declined below the USD 200 support and tested the USD 190 level. ETH/USD is currently correcting higher, but it is facing resistance near the USD 200 and USD 205 levels.
If there is a break above the USD 205 level, the price is likely to face a strong barrier near USD 215. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 190, below which there is a risk of more losses towards the USD 175 level. Bitcoin cash price  tested the USD 425 level and recovered a few points. BCH/USD may continue to correct higher, but the USD 460 and USD 480 levels are likely to protect gains. The most important resistance for buyers is positioned near the USD 500 level. The key supports on the downside are USD 425 and USD 410.
Ripple price  recovered nicely and it is currently up more than 3% to USD 0.428. XRP/USD must break the USD 0.440 and USD 0.450 resistance levels to extend the current recovery towards the USD 0.500 level in the near term. Recently, Coinbase Pro announced that the 0x token (ZRX) will be launched on their platform, which boosted the price. A few other altcoins like LOOM, MANA and BAT also gained between 8%-15%. Overall, bitcoin found support near USD 6,200 and is currently recovering. However, buyers are facing a lot of hurdles near USD 6,400. Therefore, a major recovery in BTC/USD is very unlikely. If sellers regain control, there could be a fresh round of selling in bitcoin and major altcoins in the coming sessions.

" Less than a week left for the crypto community to tell the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) what they think of the proposed bitcoin-based exchange traded fund ETF from VanEck. Since June, almost 1,400 comments have been submitted. The SEC recently extended the time period for which it will review comments from the public on the matter. It further went on to list 18 detailed questions about statements made in the ETF proposal that it asked to public to comment on.  Jake Chervinsky, a Washington-based lawyer specializing in government enforcement related to the blockchain industry, tweeted: Reminder: you have one week left to submit comments in response to the SEC's questions on the VanEck/SolidX bitcoin ETF proposal.Go here (https://t.co/RpJfcOAvjM) & click ""Submit Comments on SR-CboeBZX-2018-040"" to tell the SEC what you think.Public opinion matters. Be heard! A decision on whether to approve or disapprove the proposed ETF is not expected until the first quarter of 2019. While the community is somewhat divided in terms of what benefits an ETF listing could bring to bitcoin, the general consensus remains that it will at least provide a temporary boost to the bitcoin price. Unsurprisingly, Gabor Gurbacs, digital asset director at VanEck, is among those who believe an ETF would bring strong benefits to the number one cryptocurrency: What an #ETF brings to #Bitcoin:-Increased liquidity via the AP & ETF ecosystem-Lower counter-party risk-Better valuation and execution practices -Separation of duties: trading, custody, valuation-Lower fees-Compliance with global regulations -Asset mgmt experience pic.twitter.com/R1ACMd3EQ6 Meanwhile, some members of the bitcoin community, including technologist and serial entrepreneur Andreas M. Antonopoulos, are against Wall Street money pouring into bitcoin in the form of an ETF. “ETFs fundamentally violate the underlying principle of peer-to-peer money, where each user is operating not through custodian, but has a direct control of their money, because they have direct control of their keys. Your keys - your bitcoin, not your keys - not your bitcoin,” Antonopoulous warned in August adding that Bitcoin ETF will become an instrument to manipulate bitcoin prices, scaling and forking debates.  In either case, until October 17, everyone has a chance to tell what they think.  Then comment and say so!I think any intelligent contribution to this discussion is valuable & worthwhile. It's also important for the SEC to get multiple informed perspectives so they can better understand crypto in general. And here is what people told the SEC (unedited):  Maxwell Gomersall
To whom it may concern,
I am writing about the Bitcoin ETF decision to express my opinion on your decision.  
I believe it is time you stop pushing the decision back and chose what to do, delaying the inevitable simply looks ridiculous. Many have sent you their opinions regrading this topic and are in support of an ETF and not to mention the institutions who are awaitning your decision. Postponing this is not going to change the outcome Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will have a large role in our future and this is one of the first steps as the innovators America is known as make the right choice and approve the decision as people will look back at this one day and wonder why it took so long to make such a clear decision.  
Furthermore, the decision is vital for the US economy as a stock market crash is due and once this happens many will lose their savings and jobs which without a safe and assuring alternative like Bitcoin many institutions will go bust or have no where to place their money making their growth stagnate. This will only be bad for the US economy as if they had the option to invest in Bitcoin they would be receiving positive returns which will lead to growth in their business and therefore growth in US economy despite the market crash which will happen in the next 4 months if not earlier.  
I strongly urge you to approve the decision before the opportunity is missed.  
Yoirs sincerely,

_______ Bobby Mulligan
Dear members and representatives of the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"").
I would like to express my strongest opposition against allowing Bitcoin (""BTC"") Exchange Traded Funds (""ETF's"").
BTC shows little promise for being effective as a ""store of value"" or medium of exchange with its transaction costs being much more than the current centralized clearinghouse model that is in place today. Additionally, there is no accountability for transaction clearing, which can be concerning on many fronts. With little more than speculative supply and demand value, the average unaccredited investor can suffer from the ""greater fool"" phenomena.  
In its unregulated and short existence, BTC has existed in an environment of fraud, crime, and speculation, and I do not believe there is true investor value outside of those three factors for the asset. Because of the high transaction expenses, there are no reasonable efficiencies to be had from the BTC technology, though refinement and other applications may exist.
Sincerely,  
Robert Mulligan

" It looks like Bitcoin just reached another important milestone on the way to mass adoption. It's called the Liquid Network and it's live now. This is a sidechain built on the Bitcoin network by San Francisco startup Blockstream. A sidechain is a separate blockchain that is linked to the main blockchain through what is referred to as two-way pegging, which enables digital assets to be interchangeable between the two chains without jeopardizing their performance or speed. ""The Liquid Network provides fast, secure, and confidential transactions to address the needs of exchanges, brokers, market makers, and financial institutions around the world,"" Blockstream CSO Samson Mow said in a blog post.  According to him, the launch of the network after three years of development marks ""the beginning of a new era of digital asset issuance and transacting by enabling the tokenization of fiat, gold, securities, and even other new crypto assets – all with Bitcoin at the center."" The startup claims that Liquid has these benefits:  However, the biggest problem most bitcoin fans have with Liquid is that it is a “federated sidechain,” relying on a group of companies to collectively manage the sidechain, making it centralized. “Following a federated consensus approach was the easiest way to deploy Liquid, but its consensus could change in the future,” tweeted Lucas Nuzzi, bitcoin researcher.  Don't underestimate @Blockstream's #LiquidNetwork sidechain launch. It's kind of a big deal.I get it, federated round robin consensus doesn't sound appealing, but it's a start. The implications of usable sidechains are huge and the positives certainly outweigh the negatives👇 Moreover, the startup claims that ""no single party, including Blockstream, can control the Liquid network, and furthermore, no single entity is in control of more than a single Liquid functionary server."" Other than just facilitating faster trade, Liquid lets partners launch tokens on the platform, representing financial instruments, fiat currencies or crypto assets. The startup even claims that the sidechain works better than the smart contract blockchain Ethereum for launching tokens. Additionally, Blockstream will be deploying a wallet specifically for Liquid transactions, while hardware wallets Ledger and Trezor have unveiled plans to adopt the technology as well. Also, there is an undisclosed monthly subscription fee for users of this new network. The sidechain has become another important development for Bitcoin alongside the Lightning Network. In comparison, while the Liquid sidechain is purpose-built to cater for the needs of exchanges, brokers and traders, the the Lightning Network is designed to enable the near-instant transfer of small or micro value payments between linked channel members and merchants. Meanwhile, there is always that part of the community that doesn’t care about the technology too much. Twitter user WhalePanda, a famous crypto enthusiast, ironically tweeted referring to the recent drop in the market:   Last night's dump on all cryptocurrencies was obviously because of the release of Liquid.

" The entire crypto market saw a sharp sell-off early Thursday morning, with the top three coins bitcoin, ethereum, and ripple all recording losses of 4%, 9%, and 10%, respectively, over the last 24 hours (UTC 06:00 AM). The drop followed after a mysterious bitcoin whale had made a huge transaction, moving 22,100 bitcoins out of a wallet. At current market prices, the bitcoins are worth an astonishing USD 137.6 million. The transaction: ____
Bitcoin price chart: It is, however, unclear what the large transaction means for the market, as both the sending and receiving addresses are unknown. Still, the crypto community loves to speculate, with some Twitter users suggesting that it could be the result of a large over-the-counter (OTC) buy order. OTC trading refers to trading outside of exchanges – often favoured by large investors as they seek to avoid affecting market prices with their orders. Its looks like OTC buy order, as wallet is new, there is no old transactions. if this was transaction to exchange then it would dumped Others, yet, say that the transaction was merely a move from a single key wallet, to a multisignature wallet – a type of wallet that requires several private keys in order to make transactions. Moved from an address which was merely protected by one single private key to a multisig wallet. Only reasonable to do so with that amount. Although the so-called bitcoin whales are often blamed whenever are large downward price movements in the bitcoin market, new data compiled by blockchain analysis company Chainalysis suggests that this group of very large holders may in fact be a stabilizing force for the market. By studying available data on the 32 largest bitcoin wallets, Chainalysis found that whales are indeed a rather diverse group, and that only about a third of them could be considered “active traders.” Two thirds of whales are, in other words, long-term holders of bitcoin, not doing anything with their holdings even when the rest of the market is selling off heavily. Perhaps even more interesting is that the whales that are considered active traders were largely trading “against the herd,” thus smoothing out market movements both to the upside and downside.  According to the firm, this was particularly true during the major price declines of December 2017 and throughout 2018, when the largest traders were in fact net buyers of bitcoin, providing crucial support to a market that was otherwise dominated by smaller retail traders and hobby investors.",2018-10-11
" Latin American e-commerce platform Rappi has announced that it will begin accepting Bitcoin pay from its Colombian customers. The company has over 30,000 couriers, and has been described by the North American media as a “Latin American tech unicorn.” Per Argentina-based media outlet Infobae, Rappi decided to roll out Bitcoin pay following a customer survey of its Colombian users – although it has not yet reveled exactly when the service will become available, or what sort of payment platform it will use. Rappi’s popularity has skyrocketed in Columbia since it was founded in the country three years ago. Per Axios and Techcrunch, the company “raised more than USD 200 million” in August this year, in a new funding at “a valuation north of USD 1 billion.” Major investors include the likes of Hong Kong-based DST Global, as well as American venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. Thus far, it appears Rappi will only be offering Bitcoin pay options to its Colombian customers. However, the company is also extremely popular in Mexico, where experts have recently claimed that crypto usage will be mainstream “by 2020 or 2021.” Infobae states that some 50% of Rappi’s sales are made in Mexico City.  The e-commerce platform is also active in Argentina – where cryptocurrencies are rapidly gaining popularity, with dozens of Bitcoin ATMs now being installed across the country. Rappi also operates in Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. As well as traditional e-commerce retail, the company also offers a range of quirkier services, such as courier-delivered ATM cash withdrawals and dog walking.

" Attempts to guess what direction the crypto market will take next now have a new angle and it's called “the industry is on the brink of an implosion.” At least, according to a new study by digital commerce and fintech analysis firm Juniper Research that claims that this year’s sell-off in the crypto market may have just been the beginning of a broader decline of the crypto economy.   The study, dubbed The Future of Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin & Altcoin Trends & Challenges 2018-2023, pointed to the fact that daily bitcoin transaction volumes have fallen from around 360,000 per day in late 2017, to 230,000 as of September 2018. According to the researchers, worsening economic conditions internationally this year should be favorable for alternative currencies like Bitcoin, considering events such as the decline of several fiat currencies due to global trade tensions, Brexit, and currency-crises in several developing countries including Turkey, Argentina, and Venezuela. As these events so far have failed to translate into higher crypto prices, Juniper concluded that “it is unlikely to prosper as and when these issues are resolved.” “Like any asset, it is worth whatever someone is prepared to pay for it, but it has no meaning or existence beyond the confines of the ledger. It is a bubble, and there is a strong possibility that this bubble could burst in the near future,” report author Dr. Windsor Holden claimed, adding that “bitcoin has no intrinsic value.”  “In short, given our concerns around both the innate valuation of bitcoin, and of the operating practices of many exchanges, we feel that the industry is on the brink of an implosion,” he said in a white paper accompanying Juniper's research. Also, according to Holden, there is a decline in the base of individuals who are willing to pay inflated prices for cryptocurrencies, credit card companies have banned customers from paying for bitcoin on a card, and social media sites have banned initial coin offering advertising: ""Taken together, this means that there is likely to be less demand, with less funds available to invest in Bitcoin."" However, recent news may show a bit different perspective. For example, David Swensen, chief investment officer at Yale University, who by many is considered the most influential investor in the world, has now reportedly invested in two crypto-focused venture funds. Also, Coinbase, the US-based fiat-to-crypto exchange and wallet service, is reportedly valued at USD 8 billion and in talks with Tiger Global, an investment firm, for up to USD 500 million. This is a sure sign that the industry is more than just “tulips,” according to famous Bitcoin bull Michael Novogratz. Meanwhile, a recent informal poll by Fundstrat Global Advisors, a Wall Street research company, indicated that the usually very cautious Wall Street investors are now overwhelmingly calling a bottom in the bitcoin market. Twitter users, however, are still skeptical, with a majority saying bitcoin still has room to fall. In the past, Juniper Research has also published research painting a more nuanced picture of the cryptocurrency market. In September, the firm found that 64% of respondents in a survey said their company was already actively engaged in, or considering, various blockchain related initiatives, marking a significant increase from the 34% of companies that said the same thing last year. The study further revealed that nearly half of those companies were looking to Ethereum as their platform of choice.",2018-10-10
" China holds more influence over Bitcoin than many are ready to admit, which could damage the whole network, a new study shows. The country “threatens the security, stability, and viability of Bitcoin” with its “political and economic control over domestic [cryptocurrency] activity, and control over its internet infrastructure,” shows the study from Princeton and Florida International Universities. The research paper, titled The Looming Threat of China: An Analysis of Chinese Influence on Bitcoin, goes on to explain: “As the value and economic utility of Bitcoin have grown, so has the incentive to attack it. We singled out China for analysis because they are the most powerful potential adversary to Bitcoin, and we found that they have a variety of salient motives for attacking the system and a number of mature capabilities, both regulatory and technical, to carry out those attacks.” The Bitcoin mining system is “heavily centralized,” the study goes on to say, as “over 80% of Bitcoin mining is performed by six mining pools,” with five of those managed directly by individuals or companies based in China. This could make a 51% attack viable, as the combined effort of Chinese mining pools accounts for 74% of Bitcoin’s hash power (or computing power). “This is a significant share of the global hashrate – more than controlled by any other single country – but the precise quantity is unknown,” the study adds. ____ “If the Chinese government assumed control of domestic hash power, this property would grant them an advantage in selecting blocks for the ledger, which is important for some types of attacks.” The research defines four attack classes: censorship, deanonymization, weakening consensus, disruption to competing mining operations. In total, the academics identified 19 different attacks currently available to Chinese mining pools. Ideologically, China might even be incentivized to try to destroy Bitcoin, given its centralized regime of totalitarian communism. Even worse than outright destroying it, China might weaponize its control over Bitcoin in order destabilize foreign economies, the researchers believe. However, some in the crypto community disagrees. Reddit user u/igadjeed calls the idea of the mining pools banding together to destroy Bitcoin “academic racism,” adding: “The fallacy here is - because it happens in China, the Government can control it.” They go on to explain, “The blatant fallacy here is - mining pools control miners. There are hundreds of thousands of miners in the ‘Chinese’ mining pools, and most of them are not in China. If there was authoritarian coercion of pool managers, the miners would most likely abandon those pools. Yes, the concentration of pool managers in China is a centralisation issue. Currently, the pools do not censor which transactions get included in a block, except that transaction fees influence choice of transactions, as they always have [but] mining centralisation issues are mostly mitigated by the fact that miners are independent operators. If a pool becomes corruptly managed, the miners will choose a different pool.” The paper has not yet been peer reviewed, so its findings should be taken with a grain of salt.",2018-10-09
" The deputy head of Israel’s tax bureau has announced that the government is prepared to accept alternatives to the first in, first out (FIFO) system for taxing cryptocurrency-related earnings. Experts say the move could save investors big money on their tax bills. Per media outlet Calcalist, Roland Am-Shalem, the Deputy Director General of the Israel Tax Authority (ITA), told a Tel Aviv blockchain conference that investors would instead be allowed to choose to how they pay their taxes rather than using the FIFO calculation method – which critics say often over-taxes investors. Am-Shalem stated that investors could opt out of FIFO taxation calculations, which match the value of the assets of tokens to those that are most recently purchased. FIFO calculations are essentially estimations – used in cases where tax authorities have trouble estimating the precise value of assets. Cryptocurrencies are recognized as “assets” in Israel, meaning they have financial value – but not as “currencies,” which can lead to legal confusion over their precise worth. Some experts say the imprecise nature of FIFO accountancy has resulted in Israeli investors paying hefty bills on their crypto earnings, but the new announcement could potentially do away with this. Media outlet The Marker quotes former ITA deputy chief Gidi Bar Zakay as saying, that doing away with FIFO will let investors instead “calculate their cryptocurrency profits accurately, resulting in a real tax calculation.”  This, says Bar Zakay, will “lead to profits worth hundreds of millions of shekels [1 ILS = 0.27 USD] over the years.” Am-Shalem, however, insisted that such “real tax calculation” declarations would need to be backed up with proof – like blockchain-verified times and dates of purchase. He also insisted that such calculations would need to show “consistency” if they were to be accepted. The move has been welcomed by crypto experts in the country. The Marker quotes an accountant specializing in cryptocurrency matters as saying that flexibility will allow many investors to pay less tax. The accountant said, “Quite a few of our customers have actually received tax rebates using the FIFO method.” The accountant concluded that Am-Shalem’s announcement would allow investors and their accountants to choose a preferred calculation method based on their own individual situations.

" David Swensen, chief investment officer at Yale University, is reportedly betting that the cryptocurrency market will move higher from here. The university’s chief investor has become something of a legend over the years as his investment success on behalf of the university has been compared to that of Warren Buffett, also known as “The Oracle of Omaha.” Swensen, who by many is considered the most influential investor in the world, has now invested in two crypto-focused venture funds, anonymous sources told several media outlets over the weekend. The first investment is reportedly in the new USD 300 million crypto fund by Silicon Valley investment powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz. The second investment was reported to have been made in Paradigm, another new crypto fund started by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, former partner at venture capital giant Sequoia Capital Matt Huang, and former Pantera Capital employee Charles Noyes. The reason the news is so significant is largely due to Swensen’s track record as one of the most consistent outperformers in the world of professional money management. He has successfully managed Yale University’s USD 29.4 billion endowment fund since 1985, when the fund was just over USD 1 billion.  In a tweet from former Wall Street banker Mike Novogratz on Friday, he summed up the sentiment  by explaining that Swensen is effectively saying that “bitcoin is a store of value,” while calling him “the alpha bull of the herd.” This is really big news.  David Swenson the most influential investor in the world.  By making this investment he just said the bitcoin is a store of value.  He’s the alpha bull of the herd.

Yale University manages the second largest college endowment in the US, only behind Harvard. Over the past 20 years, Swensen has returned an average annual return of close to 12%. Meanwhile, as recent study from Yale University showed, cryptocurrencies may generate higher risk-adjusted returns than stocks and other assets traditionally thought of as “safer.”

" It’s an open secret that trading in bitcoin has become more difficult in recent months than it once was. Traders rely on volatility to make their money, and with less volatility, there are fewer opportunities to trade. For long-term holders and users of bitcoin, however, it’s a very different story, and low volatility is generally seen as a sign the bitcoin market is maturing. According to Gil Luria, research director at wealth management firm D.A. Davidson & Co., the recently stable bitcoin prices means that there is less speculation in the bitcoin economy. “When speculators are involved, they drive unusually high volumes as well as volatility by trading the asset with high frequency. As speculator involvement is diminished, volumes go down and volatility goes down as well,” Luria told Bloomberg. The same sentiment was also echoed by Mike McGlone, commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, explaining that bitcoin is now exhibiting signs of a “maturing market, so volatility should continue to decline.” “When you have a new market, it will be highly volatile until it establishes itself. There are more participants, more derivatives, more ways of trading, hedging and arbitraging,” McGlone said. Judging from the data, it appears the experts are right that both trading volume and volatility is down. Although most notably for bitcoin, the data confirms that the same is also true for many other cryptocurrencies. The unusually low volatility in bitcoin is confirmed by a technical indicator known as the Average True Range (ATR) indicator, as seen in the bottom of the chart below. Looking on a day-by-day basis, volatility in the bitcoin market is now down to levels not seen since July 2017, before the huge run-up in prices seen later that year. Although volatility may be low at the moment, bitcoin’s price chart looks like it is about to break-out from a massive chart pattern that has been forming since the beginning of this year. Judging from the pattern seen above, with lower highs but a floor around the USD 6,000 mark, it appears that bitcoin is about to face another battle between bulls and bears that will determine its next move. As we have seen throughout 2018, the selling pressure has been heavy on bitcoin, but buyers have consistently shown up at USD 6,000 to support the market. Over time, sellers have become exhausted as they have not been able to drive the price further down, and we have seen lower volatility as a result. The next few weeks may give us an indication of which side is stronger in the fourth quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, a new informal poll indicated that the usually very cautious Wall Street investors are now overwhelmingly calling a bottom in the bitcoin market. Twitter users, however, are still skeptical, with a majority saying bitcoin still has room to fall. In either case, the next time you read a price prediction from an expert trader, you should probably take it with a large grain of salt.",2018-10-08
" Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, on Thursday came out with a new informal poll indicating that the usually very cautious Wall Street investors are now overwhelmingly calling a bottom in the bitcoin market. Twitter users, however, are still skeptical, with a majority saying bitcoin still has room to fall. The firm had polled 25 financial institutions during a private dinner, and compared the results with 9,500 individual Twitter users.  When and at what price will Bitcoin bottom? ___ Among the institutions, 57% said they believe each bitcoin will be worth anywhere between USD 15,000 and “the moon” by the end of 2019. Among Twitter users, however, only 40% shared the same view. Where is Bitcoin's USD price by YE 2018 and YE 2019? ___ Fundstrat’s survey further revealed that 59% of institutions identified bitcoin (BTC) as their favorite coin out of 15 coins shown, while 46% of Twitter users said Ripple’s XRP was their favorite token. XRP, however, was also named the “most polarizing token” in the survey results, and no institutions chose it as their favorite.  Which top 15 tokens will be the best and worst performing in 2019? ___ ___ Which of the 15 token's investment thesis makes the least sense? Further, the firm asked participants whether they believed cryptocurrency prices would rise during a recession. Important to note here is that a majority of the institutional respondents did not believe we will see a recession in the next 18 months. If a recession does happen, however, 72% of institutions polled believed that crypto prices would rise.  Will cryptocurrency prices rise if there is a recession? ___ What is the most important macro factor influencing crypto prices? Some members of crypto community, such as Tone Vays, a trader and analyst, however, are not convinced, expressing the contrarian investment viewpoint that the majority is always wrong about market movements. The majority is wrong... Yes, the majority is ALWAYS wrong... I call it the 'stupidity' of the crowd. Thank you @fundstrat for proving that #Bitcoin falls in a recession & that $BTCUSD will NOT bottom till Mid 2019! pic.twitter.com/wXEv7fnY7f In conclusion, the firm said bitcoin is likely to “meaningfully outperform” other coins on the market between now and year end 2019, given the institutional preference for the coin and the expected inflow of capital from new initiatives, including the upcoming Bakkt app.  Meanwhile, former Wall Street banker and now-famous crypto bull Mike Novogratz, this week expressed a more cautiously optimistic view of the number one cryptocurrency, telling participants at the Economist Finance Disrupted seminar in New York that he does not believe bitcoin will break the USD 9,000 level this year.  In comparison, a month ago, Tom Lee reaffirmed his USD 20,000 bitcoin price target for the end of the year. Overall, bitcoin prices have in recent months become less and less volatile, and have largely traded in a range between USD 6,000 and USD 8,000 since May of this year. Since early September, that range has become even tighter, keeping prices between the USD 6,200 and USD 6,800 levels, as the market is waiting for a breakout in the bitcoin price.",2018-10-05
" Local government authorities in Australia have given their blessing to a deal that will see cryptocurrency exchange giant Binance invest USD 2.5 million into an Australian crypto startup – potentially opening the door for crypto pay options for travelers at international airports. Binance has struck a deal with TravelbyBit, a Queensland-based company that provides blockchain technology-powered payments solutions for travel industry companies. Per a joint press release, Binance and its new partner will look to create blockchain-powered point-of-sale (POS) payment systems at major airports around the world. Caleb Yeoh, CEO of TravelbyBit, claimed, “We’re working with the most innovative airports and retailers who want to offer their consumers non-traditional payment options.” Earlier this year, the company announced that ""travelers from all over the world are now able to pay using digital currency at Brisbane Airport, the world’s first digital currency airport."" As part of TravelbyBit’s payment system, the merchants at Brisbane Airport range from restaurants to souvenir shops and cater to all guests arriving and departing through the airport’s international terminal. TravelbyBit’s existing payment platform currently supports transactions in Bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin. Under the terms of the investment deal, the Australian company will also add support for the Binance Coin token to its platform. The state of Queensland, which had previously handed TravelbyBit a USD 71,000 business growth grant, has expressed its support for the deal. Per the press release, Queensland’s Minister for Innovation and Tourism Kate Jones stated, “It is great to see a local company partnering with one of the most established multinational companies in the blockchain ecosystem.” The startup has reportedly partnered with more than 150 merchants across Australia to accept digital currencies, and is looking to use the new investment to expand their reach across the country and turn Australia into a more crypto-friendly travel destination for people from around the world.

" Argentina is set to welcome an influx of cryptocurrency ATMs as the inflation-hit peso continues to take a financial battering. Reuters reports that a company named Athena Bitcoin, which late last month installed the country’s first Bitcoin ATM at a Buenos Aires shopping mall, says it will install a total of 30 machines in Argentina before the year’s end. The same media outlet also reports that an American company named Odyssey Group hopes to install a further 150 ATMs “at the end of the year,” with a view to having 80% of the machines fully operational “at the beginning of 2019.” Odyssey Group says its ATMs will also allow customers to make conventional bank transactions. The move will be Odyssey Group’s first foray into Latin America, but Reuters quotes the company as saying it is increasingly looking to expand its activities across the entire region. Athena Bitcoin already operates 12 ATMs in Colombia, as well as a machine in Mexico. The company says it hopes to expand its operations to Chile and Brazil. A company spokesperson said the machines – which currently only allow customers to conduct Bitcoin transactions – will be modified in the future, allowing for transactions in other tokens, such as Litecoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash. Argentina’s peso has been in freefall for much of 2018, with massive interest rate hikes doing nothing to stop its decline. In May, the country’s president asked the International Monetary Fund for a USD 50 billion loan – however, citizens are increasingly transferring their assets into foreign currencies and digital tokens as confidence in the peso continues to suffer. Data from LocalBitcoins, a peer-to-peer bitcoin marketplace, shows that weekly bitcoin trading volume on this marketplace is more than 20 bitcoins over the past few months.  As reported by Cryptonews.com, the number of crypto ATMs in the world is rising steadily, and that they're enjoying increased usage from customers. Still, the legal status of crypto is preventing their growth from being as impressive as it could be, while stubbornly high fees are placing a limit on customer usage.

" Bitcoin price mostly consolidated above the USD 6,500 support during the past few hours. BTC/USD made an attempt to clear the USD 6,650 resistance, but buyers failed to gain momentum. Similarly, Ethereum is finding a strong selling interest near the USD 235 level. The current market sentiment is neutral-to-bearish as long as bitcoin is trading below the USD 6,800 resistance. Altcoins like bitcoin cash and QTUM are showing positive signs and may perhaps continue to climb higher in the short term. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin price remained above the USD 6,500 support with a positive angle. However, there were multiple rejections noted around the USD 6,650 resistance in BTC/USD. At present, the price is trading flat near the USD 6,580 level with an immediate resistance at USD 6,620 and USD 6,650.
If buyers gain momentum above the USD 6,650 resistance, the price is likely to revisit the USD 6,800 resistance zone. On the other hand, the USD 6,500 level is a strong support, below which there is a risk of more declines towards the USD 6,400 and USD 6,320 support levels. Ethereum price remained confined in tiny range above the USD 220 level. ETH/USD seems to be facing a tough resistance near the USD 235 level, above which there are chances of a fresh rally towards the USD 250 level.
On the flip side, if sellers push the price below the USD 220 support, the price will most likely trade towards the USD 205 support in the near term. Bitcoin cash price is currently up more than 1% and is trading above the USD 540 support. BCH/USD needs to break the USD 560 resistance to climb further towards the USD 600 level. On the downside, supports are visible near the USD 540 and USD 520 levels.
Ripple price struggled to clear the USD 0.600 resistance and declined. XRP/USD is currently down more than 3% and is trading near the USD 0.560 level. The main supports are at USD 0.550 and USD 0.532. A few altcoins climbed higher today, including cortex, FUN, NEM, IOST, ELA, ELF, ETN, SC and BCN. Out of these, cortex rallied around 24% and FUN gained more than 12%.
To sum up, bitcoin price is showing a few bearish signs below the USD 6,650 and USD 6,800 resistance levels. Buyers need to soon jump into action to push the price above the USD 6,800 barrier. If not, there is a risk of a bearish reaction in BTC/USD and altcoins in the coming sessions.

" Bitcoin price dipped towards the USD 6,300 - USD 6,400 support area recently where buyers emerged. BTC/USD recovered steadily and moved back above the USD 6,500 resistance. Similarly, major altcoins like ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash completed a short-term downside correction and later bounced back. Having said that, buyers are currently facing important resistances like USD 6,800 for BTC/USD and USD 235 for ETH/USD. If there is a successful break above the stated resistances, the market could climb further higher into the positive zone. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin price failed on more than two occasions near the USD 6,800 resistance. BTC/USD corrected lower towards USD 6,400 where it found support and later recovered above the USD 6,500 and 6,550 resistance levels. 
The price is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) trading near the USD 6,600 level with an immediate resistance at USD 6,650. Above this, the price will most likely trade towards the USD 6,750 and USD 6,800 resistance levels. On the downside, the key weekly supports are USD 6,400 and 6,320. Ethereum price stayed above the important USD 200 support. ETH/USD cleared the USD 215 and 220 resistance levels, but buyers seem to be struggling near a crucial hurdle at USD 235.
If buyers surpass the USD 235 barrier, there could be decent gains towards the USD 244 and 250 levels. On the downside, the main supports are visible near USD 215 and USD 200. Bitcoin cash price failed to break the USD 600 resistance and corrected lower. BCH/USD is currently trading well above the USD 500 support with an immediate resistance at USD 550. Above USD 550, buyers are likely to take control for a push towards the USD 600 weekly resistance.
Ripple price is down around 1.5% to USD 0.580. XRP/USD recently spiked above the USD 0.600 level, but buyers failed to keep the price above the stated level. On the downside, the main weekly supports are at USD 0.572 and USD 0.550, and resistances are USD 0.600 and USD 0.620. During the past three sessions, a few altcoins gained traction, including odyssey, nebulas, verge, THETA, siacoin, wanchain and ZIL. Out of these, Odyssey and nebulas traded higher by 34% and 23% respectively. To sum up, bitcoin seems to be holding the ground very well above the USD 6,400 support.

On the downside, the previous resistances near USD 6,600 and USD 6,500 are likely to act as supports if the price corrects lower. Ethereum price finally managed to gain strength above the USD 215 resistance. ETH/USD gained more than 8% and tested the next resistance at USD 230. Above this, the price may climb towards the USD 240 level.
If there is a downside correction, the broken resistance at USD 215 could act as a strong support for buyers in the near term. Bitcoin cash price traded further higher above yesterday’s high and climbed above the USD 575 level. BCH/USD is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) correcting lower towards the USD 540 support. Below this, the USD 520 level could stop the downside correction. On the upside, the USD 560 and USD 575 levels are immediate hurdles for buyers.
Ripple price recovered and moved back above the USD 0.520 level. XRP/USD seems to be facing a lot of hurdles near the USD 0.540 and USD 0.550 resistances.

Other major altcoins like ethereum and ripple are also trading with a positive angle, but both are facing important hurdles on the upside. Going forward, bitcoin buyers need to gain strength above USD 6,500 for an upside acceleration. If not, it could drop back towards the USD 6,300 level. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin price is currently trading above the USD 6,400 support. BTC/USD recently tested the USD 6,500 - USD 6,525 zone where sellers emerged and protected more gains. It seems like the price is trading in the USD 6,300 - USD 6,500 range.
If there is a break above the USD 6,500 resistance, the price may trade above the USD 6,550 and USD 6,600 levels. On the other hand, a downside break below USD 6,300 could spark heavy slides in the near term. Ethereum price is consolidating above the USD 200 and USD 205 support levels.

" While last week was marked by a surprisingly strong market despite several negative news events, it appears this week is turning out the opposite way. This time, two good news for crypto adoption, announced by Coinbase and Google was not enough to excite crypto traders, who continued to sell off holdings of bitcoin and major altcoins on Wednesday, which marked the fifth straight day of losses for bitcoin.  With the exception of Ripple’s XRP, which surged more than 10% in early Wednesday trading, most of all top 50 coins by market capitalization were in the red for the last 24 hours. In a statement published by Coinbase on Tuesday, the popular US-based fiat-to-crypto exchange announced a new listing process for new digital assets, while saying that their goal is to “rapidly list all assets” that meets their standards. The new statement marks a turnaround for Coinbase, which in the past has been hesitant to list new digital assets on its platform, and for a long time sticking with only bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin as alternatives for their users to invest in. Now, however, it appears that the exchange has finally secured the regulatory assurances it needs to list more assets, even as their listing process becomes simplified. According to the exchange, this becomes possible by making some of the new assets available for users in a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction manner, meaning users in different regions may not necessarily have access to the same assets. Also worth pointing out is that unlike other exchanges that may charge up to USD 1 million to list a new asset, Coinbase said their application process will be free of charge to begin with. In other news from Tuesday, Google said it has once again opened up for ads with crypto-related content in the US and Japan, after placing a ban earlier this year. This time, however, it is treading more carefully, allowing only certain regulated crypto exchanges to advertise using its tools.  Google’s decision follows a similar move from Facebook in July this year, when it said that it will allow crypto-related ads from pre-approved companies.
____ As reported on Monday, as the crypto market has become less sensitive to hype, and investors, speculators have largely held on to their positions over the summer, the bitcoin market will make a major move, for better or worse, only in response to a fundamental change, according to a new research from blockchain analysis company Chainalysis.",2018-09-26
" As the crypto market has become less sensitive to hype, and investors, speculators have largely held on to their positions over the summer, the bitcoin market will make a major move, for better or worse, only in response to a fundamental change, according to a new research from blockchain analysis company Chainalysis. Regulations, new use cases, and developments in technology are possible drivers for the next move in prices, the authors of the research said. “The first challenge of adoption —getting cryptocurrency into people’s hands— has been overcome, but we are now waiting to see what the next stage of adoption looks like,” they added.  The authors suggested that the remarkably stable amount of speculative coins could be indicative of “a market less sensitive to hype,” and that individual news stories no longer affect bitcoin prices to the same extent as they did during the 2017 rally when many new participants entered the market. For example, an interesting thing about the bitcoin rally last week was that the price increased nearly 8% despite news coverage that would normally be considered negative. “The market seems to have recalibrated after the entry of so many new market participants with different beliefs and expectations than those who held bitcoin prior to 2017,” according to the research. Also, both long-term investors and speculators in the bitcoin market have largely held on to their positions over the summer, helping maintain relatively stable bitcoin prices, even as some altcoins have fallen sharply. The research revealed that the number of bitcoins held by speculators has remained stable from May to August this year, at around 22% of the total bitcoin supply. Meanwhile, longer-term investors accounted for 30% of the coin supply over the same time period. To conduct the study, Chainalysis divided the total bitcoin supply of 21 million BTC into five categories depending on how liquid the coins are, or how often they move, ranging from “speculative coins” that are traded often, to “investment coins,” and lastly “lost and unmined coins.”",2018-09-25
" Over the past week, the bitcoin price has increased nearly 8% in a steady grind higher, taking it above the psychologically important USD 6,500 level. The most interesting thing to note about the rally, however, is that it has come without any obvious fundamental drivers to point to, and despite news coverage that would normally be considered negative for the bitcoin price. As seasoned traders and investors know, it is often considered a very bullish sign when an asset increases in price despite negative news coverage. It shows that the upward momentum is strong, and that there are buyers standing by in the market, ready to buy up even the slightest dip in price. This Sunday, Travis Kling, founder of the new crypto hedge fund Ikigai, on Twitter echoed the sentiment that bear markets normally don’t respond positively to negative news events. You can't ignore the market's lack of negative reaction to the CVE vulnerability announced a couple days ago.That's not what bear markets do. Bear markets ignore positive news events and overemphasize negative news events. Beginnings of a regime change?https://t.co/cJNnrSsBgs In the tweet, Kling referred to a recently discovered bitcoin bug, disclosed in an official Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) report from Bitcoin Core developers. According to the report, an attacker could potentially have exploited the bug to mine invalid blocks, essentially creating new bitcoins beyond the 21 million BTC cap. Despite this serious bug and the warning that there is a small chance of a chainsplit, bitcoin continued its week-long grind higher. Another news story that bitcoin hodlers and traders alike took note of this past week was that we will likely have to wait even longer for the first bitcoin-backed exchange traded fund (ETF) to be approved in the US. In a notice published online, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked for more comments from the public in connection with a proposal to list an ETF backed by “physical” bitcoin by financial firm VanEck. The SEC also made it clear that it needs more time to reach a decision on whether to approve the proposal. Again, the price of bitcoin reacted to the news by trading higher, adding nearly 2% on the day the news was released, before surging close to 4% on the following day. Despite widespread speculation that the ETF may not be approved until March next year, some members of the community attributed the gains to the fact that the language of the official notice was more positive than earlier. In addition, the SECs decision to ask for more comments was largely seen as a positive development, signaling a willingness by the regulator to learn more about the bitcoin market. Perhaps, most entertaining this past week was a show-down between a number of cryptocurrency exchanges and New York’s attorney general.  In a statement, attorney general Barbara D. Underwood blasted cryptocurrency exchanges Binance, Kraken, and Gate.io for failing to provide information requested by her office. She added that the three exchanges have been referred to the New York State Department of Financial Services for “possibly operating unlawfully in New York.” CEO of Kraken Exchange, Jesse Powell, posted a response on Twitter saying that “NY is that abusive, controlling ex you broke up with 3 years ago”, reminding that the exchange is not operating in New York. NY is that abusive, controlling ex you broke up with 3 years ago but they keep stalking you, throwing shade on your new relationships, unable to accept that you have happily moved on and are better off without them. #getoverit https://t.co/DC5S1WyRnp Once again, bitcoin traders appeared unaffected and reacted by sending the coin higher both on the day of the news and the next day. Lastly, Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Zaif became the victim of yet another exchange hacking scandal this past week. In the early hours of September 20, the company issued a statement saying that its network had been compromised by hackers four days earlier. According to the statement, hackers got away with 5,966 BTC, worth approximately USD 40 million, from users’ hot wallets on the exchange. Also, it appears as if the exchange first tried to cover up the hack from its users, saying on September 17 that it had suspended withdrawals and deposits due to “sever failure.” Currently, in addition to BTC and MONA, BCH deposit / withdrawal is suspended due to server failure. We are investigating for recovery. Please refrain from depositing / withdrawing money.Moreover, settlement by ZaifPayment is also stopped. We’re sorry for the inconvenience. As became known three days later, however, the real reason for the suspension was a security breach. Despite this, bitcoin traders didn’t seem to care, sending the number one cryptocurrency surging another 3.9% for the day. So, if following the news makes you confused about what the market is doing, perhaps it is better to instead listen to the words of the legendary American stock investor Jesse Livermore, who once said: “Markets are never wrong but opinions often are.”",2018-09-24
" This past week, there were decent gains in bitcoin, ethereum and ripple. BTC/USD traded close to the USD 6,850 level before sellers started to dominate. The price corrected lower, but there are many supports above the USD 6,400 level. Similarly, ethereum is placed above the USD 200 pivot level and any dips are likely to find buyers on the downside. More importantly, ripple price is trading with a bullish angle above USD 0.500 and may rally one more time above USD 0.650. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin price topped recently near the USD 6,850 level and corrected below USD 6,740. BTC/USD is down around 1% with an immediate support near the USD 6,600 level. Below this, the weekly supports are visible near the USD 6,520 and USD 6,400 levels.
On the flip side, if the price continues to move higher, the USD 6,850 resistance could stop upsides. Above this, bitcoin buyers may perhaps attempt a clear break above the USD 7,000 level. Ethereum price failed to settle above the USD 250 resistance and is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) trading below the USD 240 level. On the downside, ETH/USD might find support near the USD 222 and USD 210 levels.
Once the current correction wave is over, the price may revisit the USD 250 zone. On the upside, a break above the USD 250 weekly resistance could trigger more gains towards the USD 275 level. Bitcoin cash price failed to stay above the USD 500 level and is currently down more than 2%. BCH/USD may possibly correct further towards the USD 450 support level, below which sellers could regain control. On the upside, the USD 500 and USD 510 levels are crucial hurdles.
Ripple price is down around 3%, but it is still trading above the USD 0.500 support. XRP/USD may clear the USD 0.580 resistance to trade past USD 0.600 and USD 0.620 in the near term. During the past few sessions, a few altcoins corrected lower between 5% - 8%, including IOTA, bitcoin diamond, DGD, DRGN, PIVX, BNT, XMR, MAID, POWR and MKR. Overall, bitcoin is trading with a positive bias above the USD 6,400 weekly support. However, buyers need to push the price above USD 6,850 and USD 7,000 resistances for more gains. If not, there is a risk of a fresh downward move towards USD 6,400 or even USD 6,200. Similarly, ethereum must stay above USD 200 to bounce back in the coming days. _____",2018-09-24
" Bitcoin has a DDoS (distributed denial of service) vulnerability and developers have warned that everyone has to update the software to a new version or it could all collapse. Now, they add that while the bug has been fixed, there is still a small chance of a chainsplit within the next week or so. The initial patch notes state that, “A denial-of-service vulnerability (CVE-2018-17144) exploitable by miners has been discovered in Bitcoin Core versions 0.14.0 up to 0.16.2. It is recommended to upgrade any of the vulnerable versions to 0.16.3 as soon as possible.” Anyone willing to exploit this bug, however, would have to sacrifice a block reward of 12.5 BTC (more than USD 80,000) to do so.  Although this may seem far-fetched, other possible (and maybe even probable) issues present themselves: a chainsplit, which occurs when two or more versions of a blockchain exist at any one time. All competing versions share an identical history up until the point at which they split. Currently, incompatibilities between different versions of full node software could trigger a chainsplit.  “There is currently a small risk of a chainsplit. In a chainsplit, transactions could be reversed long after they are fully confirmed,” the developers warn, adding, “Therefore, for the next week or so you should consider there to be a small possibility of any transaction with less than 200 confirmations being reversed.” However, they also promise to keep the community updated and add that if a chainsplit should happen, “action may be required.” Currently, double-spending presents the biggest challenge, as there is still a way to try to double-spend, as explained in a full disclosure statement that the developers published. Still, the post adds, “At this time we believe over half of the Bitcoin hashrate [or computing power] has upgraded to patched nodes. We are unaware of any attempts to exploit this vulnerability. However, it still remains critical that affected users upgrade and apply the latest patches to ensure no possibility of large reorganizations, mining of invalid blocks, or acceptance of invalid transactions occurs.”

" In a recent interview, Michael Novogratz, former hedge fund manager and current Bitcoin bull, mentioned how we will all use bitcoins to pay at Starbucks and Microsoft - something the community quickly picked up on. Reddit is now speculating whether Novogratz is “dropping some insider crumbs of knowledge for us masses” in terms of adoption. At the Yahoo Finance’s All Markets Summit, Novogratz called the crypto price rally of December 2017 “the first global speculative mania ever,” and added that, “Like with any mania, [things] got crazy.”  In terms of adoption, he talked about Bakkt, a heavyweight crypto platform in development, and reminded that Microsoft and Starbucks are partners there, which could drive the companies to start accepting cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. ""You're all going to start using Bitcoin to buy coffee of games soon enough,"" Novogratz said (04:10), adding that “Bitcoin is, I think, going to have a renaissance here soon.” Highlight: Galaxy Investment Partners CEO Mike @novogratz calls the cryptocurrency boom in late 2017 ""the first global speculative mania ever. ... Like with any mania, [things] got crazy."" https://t.co/eKXLsOTUP9 #YahooAMS #bitcoin $btc $xrp $eth #blockchain pic.twitter.com/BKHz7SW5Yn Bakkt partnering with Microsoft, Starbucks and other companies had been announced back in the beginning of August: “The new company is working with a marquee group of organizations including BCG, Microsoft, Starbucks, and others, to create an integrated platform that enables consumers and institutions to buy, sell, store and spend digital assets on a seamless global network.” Back then, Maria Smith, vice president of partnerships and payments for Starbucks, said that, “As the flagship retailer, Starbucks will play a pivotal role in developing practical, trusted and regulated applications for consumers to convert their digital assets into US dollars for use at Starbucks. As a leader in Mobile Pay to our more than 15 million Starbucks Rewards members, Starbucks is committed to innovation for expanding payment options for our customers.” The company later clarified that customers will not be paying directly with bitcoin, but that the company has joined forces with other well-known brands to create a platform to “convert digital assets like Bitcoin into US dollars, which can be used at Starbucks.” “However, we will continue to talk with customers and regulators as the space evolves,” they concluded. Financial results: Starbucks ____
Microsoft Novogratz’s comment is not unfounded then, but the community is speculating that he has insider knowledge that could mean bitcoin adoption in these companies will happen sooner than expected. He has also previously called a bottom on crypto prices. Bottom or not, at least at the time of writing the crypto market is green.",2018-09-21
" The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made it clear that it needs more time to reach a decision on whether to approve a proposed exchange traded fund (ETF) backed by “physical” bitcoins, issued by investment firm VanEck. However, in contrast to previous delays, this time Bitcoin advanced by more than 2% in the last 24% hours. This marks the fourth straight day of gains for bitcoin, bringing it back above the short-term resistance level of USD 6,500 on the chart. The SEC, the agency tasked with approving or disapproving new ETF applications in the US, wrote in the note that it encourages interested persons to provide comments in the weeks ahead, before a final decision will be made. It went on to list 18 detailed questions about statements made in the ETF proposal that it asked to public to comment on. Among questions asked were things like people’s view on whether the bitcoin market is less susceptible to manipulation than other commodities that ETFs typically hold, and whether surveillance and market monitoring by exchanges is sufficient to prevent and detect fraudulent trading activities. The proposal in question was originally filed by VanEck with the help of the Chicago Board Options Exchange on June 6 this year, but any decision on it can be delayed a number of times under current regulations, giving the SEC until early next year to reach a decision. In either case, the crypto community is divided whether Bitcoin ETF will help Bitcoin or will become harmful.",2018-09-21
" Bitcoin price declined sharply recently and traded below the USD 6,250 support. BTC/USD tested the USD 6,100 support where buyers emerged and the pushed the price sharply higher above USD 6,400. Similarly, there were swing moves in ethereum and bitcoin cash, but prices held important supports and recovered. Overall, the market is back in a positive zone, but buyers need to stay in control. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin price traded above the USD 6,550 resistance, but sellers defended more gains. BTC/USD is down to USD 6,400 and it is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) trading in a range. An immediate support on the downside is near the USD 6,300 level, followed by the USD 6,250 level.
If the price moves higher, it could find sellers near the USD 6,440 level. Above this, the price may perhaps rise back towards the USD 6,500 barrier. Ethereum price dipped below the USD 200 level during the last decline, but it quickly recovered. ETH/USD is currently trading well above the USD 200 support.
Buyers need to push the price above the USD 215 resistance to initiate a fresh upward move. The next resistance above USD 215 is at USD 225, above which the price may test the USD 240 level. Bitcoin cash price is struggling to hold gains above the USD 420 support. BCH/USD must stay above the USD 400 and USD 420 supports to bounce back. If not, there is a risk of more losses towards the USD 380 level in the near term. On the upside, a break above USD 440 is needed for a decent recovery.
Ripple price is currently correcting lower below the USD 0.330 level. XRP/USD could continue to move down towards the USD 0.320 support where buyers are likely to appear in the near term. There were mostly positive moves in small cap altcoins, including FUN, WAX, RHOC, MANA, DRGN, BAT, CMT, LISK, KCS, DROP, MAID and PAY. Out of these, FUN gained around 16% and WAX rallied 11%. Overall, bitcoin buyers successfully defended an important support near USD 6,100. If BTC/USD continues to hold the USD 6,300 support, there could be more gains towards the USD 6,440 and USD 6,500 levels in the coming sessions. Above USD 6,500, the price may possibly rally towards the USD 6,600 level.

" Bitcoin price found a strong support near the USD 6,200 support and later started an upward move. BTC/USD traded above the USD 6,300 and USD 6,320 resistance levels. However, upsides were capped by the USD 6,400 resistance zone. More importantly, a few major altcoins rallied sharply, including ripple, cardano, tron and stellar. Ethereum also recovered above the USD 200 level and is currently trading with a positive structure. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin price remained well bid around the range support at USD 6,200. BTC/USD broke the USD 6,300 and USD 6,350 levels, but buyers failed to overcome the USD 6,400 hurdle. The price is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) up around 1.2% and is trading above the USD 6,320 level. 
On the upside, a proper break and close above the USD 6,400 zone is needed for buyers to take control. If there is a downside reaction, the USD 6,300 and USD 6,250 levels are likely to act as decent supports in the short term. Ethereum price recovered more than 6% and broke the USD 200 resistance. ETH/USD even surpassed the USD 210 level, but the price seems to be struggling to clear the USD 215 and USD 220 resistance levels.
On the downside, the broken resistances near the USD 204 and USD 200 levels are likely to act as supports if the price corrects lower. On the other hand, above USD 220, the price may rally to USD 235. Bitcoin cash price moved higher from the USD 400 - USD 410 support. BCH/USD is up more than 4% and is trading above the USD 430 level. The price has to break the USD 440 and USD 450 barriers to gain traction in the near term. On the downside, the USD 420 and USD 410 levels are decent supports.
Ripple price was one of the best performers since it climbed around 20%. XRP/USD broke the USD 0.300, USD 0.320 and USD 0.330 resistance levels. The next major resistance on the upside is near the USD 0.350 level. Many small cap altcoins gained traction recently and jumped by more than 10%, including LINK, ARDR, MKR, DRGN and WAVES. The market sentiment seems to be favoring altcoins and there could be more gains in ADA and XRP in the short term.  To sum up, bitcoin recovered from a crucial support and a few altcoins rallied. If BTC/USD breaks the USD 6,400 resistance, there may possibly be more upsides in altcoins.

" Although the bear run of 2018 - especially the past 30 days - may look both imposing and bleak, the days of crypto domination are hopefully not over. To retain a different perspective, we have made a comparison of the amount of bad news versus good news in the crypto space within the past month. However, it's nearly impossible to mention all the news, but the results show the general trend - regardless of price, crypto is a hub of positivity. In either case, let's start with the bad news first. 1. Possibly the first example that comes to mind is Goldman Sachs postponing crypto trading desk plans - although this turned out to be false, but the damage had already been done.  2. The news of ShapeShift, one of the best known platforms offering peer-to-peer trading of digital assets, introducing KYC (know your customer) procedures did not sit well with Bitcoin maximalists, who are now scared that privacy and pseudonymity are endangered. 3. Trouble loomed in other crypto exchanges as well: Star Xu, the creator of OKEx operator OKCoin seems to have had some sort of contact with the Chinese police. The amount of uncertainty surrounding this case has proven fertile ground for speculations and FUD. 4. Meanwhile, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, has met with criticism by the community after claiming that ETH will be worthless unless there are some changes in the protocol. This claim was followed by him saying that, “There isn’t an opportunity for yet another 1,000-times growth in anything in the space anymore,” which the community did not take well to either.  5. The platform connecting blockchain believers to teams that are building serious blockchain businesses Cofound.it has announced that it is closing down.  6. Russia may seek to cap crypto investments. 7. In August initial coin offering (ICO) funding has meaningfully slowed to a bit over USD 326 million. Last time ICOs raised less than USD 300 million in a month was May of 2017. 8. The worst news, however, were the prices throughout the past month. The crypto plunge has exceeded the dot-com crash of 2000 (again), which prompted naysayers to come out and show their distrust.  But while people are preoccupied checking coin prices obsessively, the cryptoverse has scored some significant victories.  1,2,3. Most recently, we wrote about three great news in one: the Winklevoss twins winning regulatory approval for their cryptocurrency, US banking giant Citigroup dipping into crypto, and the Vice President of the European Commission saying that “crypto is here to stay.” 4. Australia is also going forward in their crypto adoption: Two fintech startups have teamed up to let Aussies pay their bills using crypto. 5. Asian countries are not lagging behind, either. The Philippines are taking steps towards regulation as well: the country is looking to become more crypto-friendly. 6,7. Uzbekistan is already aiming for a high position in crypto-friendly regulatory environments, while Japan is giving another chance to Coinbase and other cryptocurrency exchanges.  8. An Iranian news agency claimed that the country has given the green light to cryptocurrency mining, with more crypto-friendly measures and legislation to follow. 9. Also, a Hong Kong company is set to issue 100,000 “cryptocurrency Visa debit cards” over the next two months, in what it claims will be a first for Asia. 10. Other financial institutions have not rejected crypto and blockchain completely. The world’s first public blockchain-based bond generated “overwhelming” interest, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia claimed. 11. Another banking giant, Morgan Stanley is reportedly preparing to offer bitcoin swap trading for clients, joining other top banks in a sectorwide effort to explore digital currencies, according to Bloomberg, who cites sources familiar with the matter. 12. Heavyweight crypto platform Bakkt announced that with their solution, the buying and selling of Bitcoin is fully collateralized or pre-funded. ""As such, our new daily Bitcoin contract will not be traded on margin, use leverage, or serve to create a paper claim on a real asset. This supports market integrity and differentiates our effort from existing futures and crypto exchanges."" According to Mike Novogratz, a former hedge-fund manager who is heavily invested in digital currencies, Bakkt might be the most important news in crypto this year. 13. And if you really don’t care about institutional adoption but would like to accept Bitcoin in your business, CoinGate and Lightning Network teamed up to help you. Shoppers are now able to pay with miniscule fees and get instant payment confirmations, while merchants can ship their goods virtually instantly without risk of chargebacks or fraud. 14. The National Assembly, South Korea’s parliament, has begun debating whether the government should overturn a ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs). 15. Are you still worried about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hedging on whether to approve crypto ETFs? The matter has not been forgotten: the popular US-based fiat-to-crypto exchange Coinbase is considering if it should submit a proposal for a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF) on its own, according to reports. Moreover, the digital asset exchange plans to expand its newly opened New York office  to 150 employees next year, from 20 currently, Coindesk reported. 16. ICO projects are starting to deliver on their promises, building their products, especially when they have secured funding for years to come. 17. One of the wealthiest football clubs in the world, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), is teaming up with a Maltese blockchain startup to launch a cryptocurrency for its fans. 18. Elad Roisman, the newly-appointed member of the SEC, becomes second pro-crypto commissionaire at SEC together with Hester Peirce. 19. Julius Baer Group, one of the oldest banking institutions in Switzerland, is reportedly acting as issuer for a cryptocurrency product.  20. Huobi Group, once the biggest cryptocurrency exchange platform in China and the world, expands to Japan via an acquisition of local exchange BitTrade. 21. Nasdaq has announced that it aims to acquire Cinnober, a major Swedish financial technology provider, that is bullish towards crypto and is helping institutional investors to invest in them.  22. Tezos, one of the top 5 ICOs of 2017, announced that its mainnet is finally live.

" While we all know that true bitcoin believers like to “hodl” their coins, a recent research have helped to understand the real extent of pure hodling versus other uses like trading and spending. The research by weekly cryptocurrency publication Diar found that over one third of total bitcoin supply, or 55% of circulating bitcoin sit in wallets (with more than BTC 200 in each) that have never made an outgoing transaction. In addition, 27% of these wallets have continued to accumulate coins during the bear market in anticipation of the next leg up in the bitcoin market. There are also a few possible explanations as to why so many bitcoin wallets have never made any outgoing transactions.  Aside from the fact that some of those walletts are owned by the cryptocurrency exchanges (at least 3.8% of the bitcoin supply is held in 5 such wallets), the most intriguing answer would be that the owners of these wallets are die-hard bitcoin hoarders. It could also be that the private keys to the wallets have been lost, owners have deceased, or through other means have become inaccessible.  According to the article, over 87% of existing bitcoins are stored in wallets with more than 10 bitcoins (worth over USD 60,000 as of press time). However, these fat wallets make up only 0.7% of all bitcoin wallet addresses, indicating that the vast majority of bitcoin wealth is held by a few long-term hodlers. Further, when looking at wallets with over 100 bitcoins, we are down to only 0.1% of all wallet addresses. These wallets hold roughly 62% of all circulating bitcoins. However, according to Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis company, between 2.3 and 3.7 million bitcoins are considered lost, meaning that the circulating bitcoin supply could be anywhere from 13% to 22% lower than official figures (more than 17 million bitcoins.)",2018-09-18
" Despite sharply lower crypto prices this year, crypto hedge funds appear to remain optimistic on the space, with existing firms expanding their operations and new ones being opened.  Founded last year by a former investment manager at Goldman Sachs, BlockTower Capital is one fund that has expanded this year, hiring additional staff and opening a second office in New York in addition to its Connecticut headquarters, a source told Bloomberg. BlockTower’s new hires reportedly comes from diverse backgrounds, including venture capital, startup incubators, and investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, Nomura, and Bank of America. Among the fund’s investors is the famous American venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Further, the article went on to cite data from the Eurekahedge Crypto-Currency Hedge Fund Index, which confirms that crypto hedge funds on average has seen a decline in returns of 52.9% this year, compared with the 54% decline in bitcoin. That comes despite the fact that many hedge funds are holding a variety of smaller tokens and altcoins, which have seen even heavier selling this year than bitcoin. The relative outperformance by hedge funds against the broader market this year suggests that the hedging and active trading strategies employed by some of these firms have been working. The Eurekahedge Index is an equally weighted index of 16 hedge funds with positions in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In 2017, the index recorded a 1,709% gain, with an annualized return since inception of 152%. Through July 31, there were 96 new crypto hedge funds and venture capital funds, an annual pace of 165, as reported by Cryptonews.com. This would surpass the record 156 crypto funds launched in 2017. More than half of all crypto funds currently in existence have launched in just the last 18 months, according to Crypto Fund Research, a research company. However, the research goes on to show that while crypto funds are the fastest growing hedge fund strategy by number, overall assets are still quite meager, compared to traditional funds.",2018-09-18
" Since our market update last week, bitcoin has continued to trade higher and is currently sitting at the psychologically important USD 6,500 level. Other coins have largely followed bitcoin higher, and we have seen stable prices and low volatility across the board in the cryptocurrency market. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
The number one cryptocurrency by market cap has seen a decent recovery since the heavy sell-off two weeks ago, when the price plunged from USD 7,400 to USD 6,100 in just four days. In addition, bitcoin has managed to remain well above the lows in the USD 5,800 area from June, a sign that the market has stabilized overall and that the bears may finally have run out of steam.
For bitcoin, the USD 6,600 level marks the immediate resistance to the upside. If that level breaks, the previous market top at around USD 7,400 would become the next major resistance area.
Also, interesting to note about the bitcoin market is that the ratio between short and long trades is still at an unusually high level, according to data from the Bitfinex exchange. As we have seen in the past, a high short-to-long ratio may trigger sharp price increases. Ethereum
Similar to bitcoin, the price of ether has also traded up over the past week, since reaching a bottom of USD 167 on Coinbase on September 12. Following that, the price bounced back, gaining over 15% on September 13 alone.
As demonstrated by the sharp rise on that day, the USD 180 level appears to be an area with significant buying interest, thus creating a floor in the market for Ethereum (at least for now). To the upside, the previous consolidation area between USD 275 and USD 290 acts as the closest resistance level. Ripple
The price of the XRP token has formed what could be an interesting double bottom formation on the daily chart, which is normally a bullish sign. Since reaching the second bottom on September 11, XRP has traded slightly up followed by a sideways consolidation. For the market to indicate a reversal to a bullish trend, a short-term break above the USD 0.37 resistance would be needed. Litecoin
The litecoin market has been stuck in a prolonged downtrend with only very small corrective rallies since May this year. Although the selling has become less intense in recent months, the market has continued to make new lows – the very definition of a downward trend used in technical analysis.
Judging from the charts, Litecoin should break above the previous high around the USD 68 area, followed by a low that is above the previous market low at around USD 50 - USD 55 until we can say that a reversal has happened. Until that happens, the technical outlook on litecoin remains bearish.   _____

" It seems that Michael Novogratz’s analysis of the new Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI) chart is not the only indicator pointing to a possible end of the bear market in bitcoin.  One indicator used by technical analysts in the market now shows “oversold” levels, indicating that a rally could follow. The indicator referenced in an article by Bloomberg is the Williams Percent Range, often referred to as Williams %R, which measures momentum in price by identifying overbought and oversold levels with readings between 0 and -100. Over the past week, the indicator has shown readings in oversold territories, below -80, although that has risen slightly to about -70 as of press time. Readings below -80 on the Williams %R have historically been good buying opportunities for bitcoin. The last time the indicator showed similar readings, in early August this year, bitcoin reacted by rallying over 20% during the month (green circle). It is worth noting, however, that technical indicators are prone to give false signals, and therefore should be interpreted with caution.  On Friday, former Wall Street banker turned cryptocurrency entrepreneur Michael Novogratz said that he believes the market has now retraced to the starting point of last year’s “massive rally/bubble,” while pointing out that strong market rallies historically have tended to retrace to the breakout point. Bitcoin price chart last week: Meanwhile, Juan Villaverde, an econometrician and mathematician who leads the Weiss Ratings team of analysts and computer programmers who created Weiss cryptocurrency ratings, suggested that the next bull cycle is still in the making.  According to Villaverde, the first few months of the next bull cycle could be slow and choppy, however, ""the next crash is bound to wipe out at least half of the gains.""  ""But as before, early investors will still come out ahead. Even those who just HODL should be sitting on some fat profits,"" the analyst estimated.",2018-09-17
" Michael Novogratz, a former hedge-fund manager who is heavily invested in digital currencies, called a bottom on cryptocurrencies in a tweet, however, the community does not completely agree - but does hope that the bottom is here. This is the BGCI chart...I think we put in a low yesterday.   retouched the highs of late last year and the point of acceleration that led to the massive rally/bubble...     markets like to retrace to the breakout..we retraced the whole of the bubble.  #callingabottom pic.twitter.com/EasTBYgjSj The BGCI chart that Novogratz references is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto index, which measures the performance of the largest digital currencies traded in dollars. Although it is still too early to say whether his prediction is right or not, the market did rise within the past 24 hours: Bitcoin is up around 2% as of the time of writing, Ethereum jumped more than 10%, while the vast majority of other top 50 coins by market capitalization are also in green.  Top 10 coins in the last 24 hours: Novogratz’s opinion on the current state of the market is not too widely shared, although this could be because the community seems to be losing their naive optimism. “I think he doesn’t know any more than you do. But I like,” said Reddit user u/Bayminer. “Maybe. Maybe not,” concludes u/DelfinGuy. Even the replies to Novogratz’s original tweet include pessimism: “History doesn’t always repeat itself,” says @fathead___. Veteran digital currency analyst, Willy Woo, had earlier written about his own insight into the current market situation: Nice live chart by @unchainedcap from their article on HODL waves. To my eye, that yellow band flattening to a level similar or below the last HODL wave signifies the end of the bear and the next period of accumulation, guessing maybe 6-12 months away.  https://t.co/extiWAwlG8 pic.twitter.com/mGB3VpVRCM This could go hand in hand with Novogratz’s bottom tweet as the market recovers from last week’s Black Wednesday - but the fact is, nobody can know until it happens.",2018-09-14
" Japanese internet provider GMO Internet has spoken about a mysterious Northern European cryptocurrency mining facility that it operates – claiming the average yearly temperatures at the location are an icy 0°C (32 °F). Speaking at a blockchain conference in Shibuya, Tokyo this week, GMO representatives talked of the company’s latest mining project – claiming they constructed the facility “somewhere in Scandinavia” (although they refused to specify where) in temperatures as low as -10°C. The company states that despite leaky roofs, the facility is now operational, and mined some 568 bitcoins (USD 3.7 million) by July this year – although it did not disclose how much it had spent on construction costs, electricity bills and other expenses in the same period. Meanwhile, GMO stated that preparing the plant provided a serious challenge, with frequent blizzards, ankle-deep snow, icy roads and heavy rain hampering the building effort. The GMO team has installed 15,000 ASIC mining rigs in two warehouses at the site, with the hardware’s energy consumption roughly equal “to that of 33,500 households.” Per Japanese media outlet Crypto Watch, GMO said they chose Northern Europe because of the region’s low temperatures, which are advantageous for keeping mining equipment cool. The company also cited the fact that Scandinavia has become a leading renewable energy player as a major factor, as well as low electricity costs. According to various analysts, the break-even price for miners is in a range of USD 6.400 and USD 8.000 per bitcoin and varies depending on the miner’s efficiency. As bitcoin hash rate — which measures computing power - is growing, so does mining difficulty. ""The increased hash rate means people are here for the long-term because they’re happy to just accumulate what they have, potentially even run at a loss,” David Sapper, chief operating officer at cryptocurrency exchangeBlockbid Pty Ltd. in Melbourne told Bloomberg last month. At the same time, “they do sometimes have to clear house and dump.” However, Genesis Mining, a giant cloud mining operator, had to terminate customers who are unable to cover their “service fee” because of low mining profitability, as reported in August. GMO considers itself a pioneer in Japanese cryptocurrency, and operates the GMO Coin exchange in addition to mining projects and its IP activities. The firm has also allowed its staff to receive a portion of their wages in cryptocurrencies. Last month, the company enlisted Borussia Dortmund forward and national team football star Shinji Kagawa to head its new marketing push.",2018-09-14
" News outlets in Vietnam are claiming commercial banks have decided to discontinue cryptocurrency-related business at the behest of the country’s central bank. The central bank recently issued a directive on cryptocurrency transactions aimed at “strengthening control” over cryptocurrency trading and online gambling sites. Per Vietnamese news site Zing, the likes of PVComBank and Vietnam International Bank (VIB) are now taking steps, by refusing all cryptocurrency-related withdrawals, transfers and card transactions. According to InfoNet, the move coincides with the country’s Ministry of Public Security decision to step up its scrutiny of IT enterprises, with an emphasis on policing multi-level business ventures, cryptocurrencies and online sports betting. The Vietnamese government has previously expressed a wish to create a comprehensive system of regulations for cryptocurrencies and fintech enterprises, and hopes to have this in place before the year’s end. Vietnam-based lawyer Duane Morris claimed on his blog this week that a draft bill may even be forthcoming in the next few days. He wrote, “Rumor has it that the first draft will be released shortly, possibly this weekend.” Enthusiasm about cryptocurrencies, mining and blockchain technology has been growing exponentially in Vietnam with population of 93 million, but encountered a major setback earlier this year when two large bogus initial coin offerings (ICOs) led to a huge public backlash. In the aftermath, the government vowed to regulate, with six ministries instructed to prepare countermeasures. _____

" Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, an insurance giant, and a widely respected figure in the space, said that crypto is not dead in spite of the current crash exceeding the dot-com crash of 2000.  “We’re going to see more widespread adoption, by both the private and public sector, of the blockchain technology and related technologies,” he told Yahoo Finance. History of the crypto market capitalization: El-Erian is also not taking the usual Wall Street approach to crypto, either, eschewing the “blockchain, not bitcoin” mantra usually heard from traditional economists. He maintains his opinion that bitcoin is best bought at USD 5,000. This is a reiteration of his stance in June, when he told CNBC that bitcoin should be bought at under USD 5,000. Back then, he said he saw bitcoin emerging as more of a tradeable commodity than a currency, but “doesn't expect it will get all the way back to USD 20,000.” Adoption is coming, but not as quickly as we would like, and not in the same way. “In terms of crypto, what we’re getting is the realization that adoption is not going to be as big and as quick as the proponents of crypto would like,” he says. “I think it’s going to be there, it’s going to last for a long time, it’s going to play a role in the ecosystem, but it’s not going to be the currency that a lot of proponents would like it to be.” Not everyone agrees with his sentiment. Neil Wilson, chief analyst at online CFD (contract for difference) and forex broker Markets.com, was quoted by Bloomberg as saying that, “it just shows what a massive, speculative bubble the whole crypto thing was […]” referring to the crash of 2018. Still, people who have been invested in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies over a longer period of time dismiss negative comparisons to the dot-com era by pointing to the Nasdaq Composite’s recovery to fresh highs 15 years later, and to the internet’s enormous impact on society. They also note that Bitcoin has rebounded from past crashes of similar magnitude. Moreover, Vice President of the European Commission, former Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis, said recently that “crypto-assets are here to stay,” while encouraging cooperation between the European Commission and the European Financial Stability Board (EFSB) or the G20 on crypto regulation. In either case, only 13% of financial leaders at more than 2,000 companies in more than 20 of the largest US metropolitan areas think that cryptocurrency will not become common for business transactions in the next five years, a recent survey showed. 87% respondents chose answers ranging from ""Not very common"" to ""Very common"", according to the survey. Also, the blockchain technology is currently placed at the “trough of disillusionment” on the Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies by Gartner Inc., an American research and advisory company. Additionally, according to the company, blockchain will reach the plateau of productivity - the end stage of mass adoption - in five to ten years. Meanwhile, Meltem Demirors, a cryptocurrency investor, Chief Strategy Officer at CoinShares, told Cryptonews.com that “long term, the biggest adoption challenges remain psychological.” ""We need confident investors who have long term conviction and a market sufficiently robust and diversified to endure lapses of conviction or faith. Until then, any sort of movement in the market will inevitably move price - and therefore, limit liquidity,"" she sain in an interview.",2018-09-13
" Just when you think you’ve seen it all, the dark web reappears to prove you wrong. Buying drugs, weapons and other highly illegal paraphernalia is practically old news at this point. But now, a marketplace called SadaqaCoins surfaced: it allows you to “anonymously” fund Jihadi, an Islamist militant movement, snipers buy buying them a 4x4 pickup, optics, or rifle . If the movie Four Lions was shot today, this marketplace would have surely made it into the script. The opening line of the marketplace is, “Never will you attain the good (reward) until you spend (in the way of Allah) from that which you love. And whatever you spend — indeed, Allah is Knowing of it,” a verse from the Qur’an which urges believers to help those in need instead of hoarding their wealth. The name comes from giving: sadaqah literally means “righteousness” and refers to voluntary charity. It is not obligatory and does not have to be material: according to some hadiths (sayings from the prophet), “a kind word and smile” can be considered sadaqah and the best form of it is “passing on knowledge.” SadaqaCoins, spotted by Benjamin Strick, an open-source analyst with an interest in privacy, blockchain, maps, terrorist activity, and conflict areas, moves away from this explanation and into terrorist territory: it is not only a way to directly fund jihad activity, but also a platform for “various projects from the Mujahidin, Muhajirin and Ansar, along with their associated financial requirements”, according to their site. It is eerily similar to Kickstarter for mujahideen, offering the possibility of either donating (currently accepting Bitcoin, Ethereum and Monero) or listing your own project. The marketplace has gone a step further, and boasts an official Twitter account. Their pinned tweet reads: “The SadaqaCoins Team is pleased to present a gift and service for the Ummah [Muslim community]. The believers now have the opportunity to advertise and support the latest projects. A considerable advantage (over other platforms) is that it our service is anonymous and secure.” I believe the site is authentic due to a number of reasons such as content on the group's Telegram and Twitter page. But more significantly, SadaqaCoins uses an elaborate system of itemized bitcoin addresses for each project. These are different to its overall donation address. pic.twitter.com/wj4nHYXv9x At the time of writing, its Bitcoin address, however, remains empty. ""This dark web 'Kickstarter for Jihadis' offers translations in German and Turkish. This should be an alarm to authorities as to the origins of Jihadi financing via Bitcoin from Europe,"" Strick stressed. As policing and counter-terrorism agencies increase their skills in investigating cyber-crime and cryptocurrency tracing, more investigations are proving that donations and purchases can be traced using data from the blockchain. Still, according to the Financial Action Task Force, the majority of donations for terrorist organizations is made in cash - don’t let the crypto naysayers tell you otherwise. And please don’t fund terrorism, with crypto or otherwise - that’s not the adoption we strive for.",2018-09-13
" There was an increase in selling pressure on the cryptocurrency market during the past three sessions. Bitcoin slowly moved lower and broke the USD 6,250 support. BTC/USD is now trading well below the USD 6,400 pivot level and it could continue to move down. Ethereum remained in a downtrend and it tumbled to a new yearly low near USD 165. Other major altcoins like ripple, bitcoin cash and litecoin are also heading south. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price failed to stay above the USD 6,250 support and traded below USD 6,200. Later, BTC/USD recovered a few points and it is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) down 1.6% to USD 6,220. If sellers remain in control, the price could continue to decline towards the USD 6,100 and USD 6,050 levels.
On the upside, the USD 6,300 level is an initial resistance, above which the USD 6,400 pivot level is the next crucial hurdle for bitcoin buyers. Ethereum
Ethereum price was one of the worst performers since it moved below the USD 185 support. ETH/USD traded to a new yearly low and close to USD 165. 
It seems like the price may perhaps continue to decline and sellers could attempt to push the price towards the next major support at USD 150. On the upsides, resistances are visible near the USD 180 and 185 levels. Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash fell significantly and registered losses more than 12% to USD 410. BCH/USD broke the USD 450 support area to move further into a bearish zone. If buyers fail to defend the USD 400 support, there could be heavy losses in the near term.
Ripple price is down around 5% and it seems like the price is about to test the USD 0.250 support. If XRP/USD fails to hold the USD 0.250 support, the next target could be USD 0.240. Other altcoins market today
Many small cap altcoins declined heavily during the past few hours like BTCD, NAS, PPT, GAS, NANO, WTC, DGD, REP, FUN, VET, LSK, ZRX and PIVX. Out of these bitcoin diamond declined 15.5% and NAS by 15.3%. Overall, the crypto market remains under a lot of pressure, which may result in more losses in bitcoin and ethereum. If BTC/USD slides below the USD 6,100 and USD 6,000 support levels, there could be a solid rise in selling in the short term.

" During the past few hours (UTC 08:30 AM), there were most consolidation moves in bitcoin price above the USD 6,250 support. BTC/USD seems to be struggling to clear the USD 6,400 resistance, increasing chances of a downside break in the near term. Similarly, ethereum remained below the USD 200 - USD 210 resistance zone with negative signs. Most major altcoins are trading in tight ranges with a tiny bearish angle. Going forward, the next move in bitcoin depends whether the price succeeds in clearing the USD 6,400 and USD 6,500 resistances. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price made another attempt to clear the USD 6,400 resistance. However, BTC/USD buyers failed to gain momentum, resulting in a rejection. On the downside, the USD 6,250 support remains a crucial barrier for sellers.
Should the price break the USD 6,250 support, there is a risk of an extended slide towards the USD 6,100 and USD 6,000 support levels. On the flip side, a close above USD 6,400 may possibly push the price above USD 6,500 in the short term. Ethereum
Ethereum price remained in a bearish zone below the USD 200 and USD 210 resistance levels. It seems like ETH/USD may continue to move down, and if it breaks USD 185, the next support is at USD 175.
On the upside, a break above the USD 210 pivot level is needed for a decent recovery towards USD 230 and USD 235 levels. Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash failed to break the USD 500 resistance and is currently down 2.5% to USD 270. If BCH/USD continues to move down, the price could test the USD 450 support zone. To recover, the price has to surpass the USD 490 and USD 500 resistance levels.
Ripple price is also down around 2.5% to USD 0.267. It seems like XRP/USD could continue to slide towards the USD 0.250 and USD 0.240 support levels in the near term. Other altcoins market today
Many small cap altcoins traded in a range during the past two sessions, including REP, MONA, LSK, BTCP, PIVX, ETC and NPXS. However, EMC and WAVES outperformed as they gained around 65% and 22% respectively. To sum up, bitcoin price is preparing for the next leg either above USD 6,400 or below USD 6,250. The current market sentiment is slightly bearish, but it won’t be easy for sellers to push the price below the USD 6,250 support in the short term. Similarly, ethereum may continue to find a strong buying interest near the USD 185 low.

" American regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an immediate suspension order for trading in two Swedish cryptocurrency investment products over the weekend, claiming traders had become confused as to whether the products could be considered as exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The SEC is opposed to the use of ETFs as a means of investing in cryptocurrencies, and has attempted to ban them altogether from the United States market. A number of companies have been trying to find a way around the regulations, however, as many in the country would like to trade cryptocurrencies in the same way as conventional stocks and shares are bought and sold. One of the ways was Bitcoin-based ETN (exchange traded note) listed on Nasdaq Stockholm exchange, under the ticker CXBTF, as reported. However, now, per a statement on the SEC’s website, investors will now be frozen out of trading in XBT Provider AB’s Bitcoin Tracker One CXBTF.PQ CXBTF.PK and Ether Tracker One CETHF.PQ CETHF.PK until September 20 at the earliest. Although they are not listed on any United States stock exchange, XBT Provider AB’s products are both listed on a Nasdaq-registered exchange in Sweden, and over the counter (OTC) transactions are common in America. The SEC cited a “lack of current, consistent and accurate information” as its reason for action, and claimed “application materials submitted to enable the offer and sale of these financial products in the United States […] characterize [the products] as ETFs.” The SEC also alleges that “certain trading websites” are currently referring to the products as ETFs. ""During such trading suspension, however, a broker-dealer may engage in activities within the United States solely for the purpose of assisting non-broker-dealer customers with the liquidation of owned positions held as of the date of this order in a transaction (or series of transactions ending with a sale) effected on the Nasdaq Nordic or other trading platform located outside the United States or with non-US persons located outside the United States including the issuer,"" the SEC added.  ETNs are close cousins to ETFs (exchange traded funds), but there are some key differences. ETNs are structured products that are issued as senior debt notes, while ETFs represent a stake in an underlying commodity. ETNs are more like bonds in that they are unsecured. ETFs provide investments into a fund that holds the assets it tracks, like stocks, bonds or gold. Meanwhile, now all eyes are still on the much-discussed VanEck ETF that the SEC is expected to decide on by September 30.",2018-09-10
" The CFO of Goldman Sachs, Marty Chavez, claims that the story about them postponing their plans for a crypto trading desk was “fake news” and that the bank is still considering how to do it, but that there is no timeline for it as of right now.  Talking at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference, he explained, “It wasn’t like we announced anything or that anything had changed for us… I never thought I’d hear myself actually use this term, but I’d really have to describe that as fake news.” Chavez further described that Goldman had been building a crypto trading platform that would be based on a commodities futures trading platform, where there is never any Bitcoin traded, but more the promise of how the currency might move. Their clients have been asking for the futures contracts since May, so the giant is hard at work to provide solutions. A timeline, however, doesn’t exist. “It’s a long road and so I would just be speculating. Maybe someone who was thinking about our activities here got very excited that we would be making markets as principal and physical Bitcoin, and as they got into realizing that that’s part of the evolution but it’s not here yet,” Chavez explained. Meanwhile, the community is outraged that these ""fake news"" have helped to push the market lower. Reddit user u/SilverHoard writes, “People really need to be held accountable for spreading verified fake news. It's one thing to have a different opinion or make a mistake, but this is deliberate. And coincidentally just at the time someone takes out a massive and random short? It's fishy to say the least.” Others are angry at panic sellers: “The same people who scream about being in it for the tech and making a change in the world. The same people who cry we need to be decentralised and get away from big banks controlling us. These are the people who will sell at a LOSS the second some random news about an investment firm or bank is released. They want a decentralised global currency but hang on the words of these ""officials"" like some kind of Stockholm syndrome. Ridiculous. Relax,” writes u/xenzor.

" The popular US-based fiat-to-crypto exchange Coinbase is considering if it should submit a proposal for a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF) on its own, Insider reported. Citing “people familiar with the matter,” the article said that Coinbase is currently in talks with blockchain technology experts at the giant Wall Street asset manager BlackRock about launching an ETF or other crypto related exchange traded product. BlackRock is the company behind iShares, one of the biggest issuers of ETFs in the US. According to one of the sources, BlackRock’s representatives have not yet given Coinbase any “concrete recommendations” on the matter. In the past, however, BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink has publicly stated that his firm’s clients do not want any crypto exposure, while even going as far as saying that he does not see any reason to prepare for the possibility of that happening in the future. With these previous comments from the BlackRock’s CEO in mind, it appears that BlackRock is not likely to be interested in becoming an issuer of a bitcoin ETF at this time. However, its team does possess valuable experience when it comes to launching ETFs, which Coinbase may be able to take advantage of, even by working with a different issuer to bring an ETF to market. The race to bring the first bitcoin-based ETF to market seems to be getting more intense by the day, with many previous attempts having already been rejected by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the regulatory body tasked with approving new ETFs in the US. It remains to be seen whether Coinbase will succeed with its ETF efforts in the foreseeable future. For now, however, all eyes are still on the much-discussed VanEck ETF that the SEC is expected to decide on by September 30.

" Lithuania based cryptocurrency payment gateway CoinGate announced that they have integrated the Lightning Network (LN) payments system for bitcoin. It means that over 4,000 businesses actively accepting bitcoin through the CoinGate platform will immediately gain access to Lightning payments, to make bitcoin transactions faster and cheaper. According to the company, with LN payments, shoppers are able to pay with miniscule fees and get instant payment confirmations, at the same time enabling merchants to ship their goods virtually instantly without risk of chargebacks or fraud. CoinGate, a payment gateway for Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and 50 other cryptocurrencies, has been testing the Lightning Network integration with a group of 100 merchants, as reported. “We were pleasantly surprised when we came across tweets of our Lightning Network implementation at the Kasbah Bar in Oslo. You may have heard critics claiming, ‘you can’t buy coffee with Bitcoin’. Well, we’re not sure about coffee, but buying beer with Bitcoin within a second for zero fees is definitely possible in Oslo”, says Dmitrijus Borisenka, co-founder and CEO of CoinGate. Just @andread74 buying his second or third beer with bitcoin #lightningThis was a bit slower than the other transactions this evening, taking a whole six seconds before confirming. pic.twitter.com/ZKdcbiI4Db The post by the company further states the usefulness of the Lightning Network: “[it] introduces a range of benefits and potential use cases for Bitcoin, such as high-volume micro-transactions, high frequency and real-time trading without storing funds with third party exchanges, among others.”  However, the company reminds that Lightning Network is in its early days and more suited to advanced users and Bitcoin enthusiasts, ""but a huge community of developers is working behind the scenes on making it user-friendly and accessible to a wider audience"".  ""By implementing Lightning Network, CoinGate is dramatically reducing the technical barrier on the merchant’s side, essentially making it effortless, while users can enable or disable Lightning with a toggle of a switch,"" according to the company. The idea of the Lightning network is that transacting and settling would be done off-blockchain, so the fees are low and thanks to the implementation of smart contracts for security, the payments can be instant - no waiting time for block confirmation. Also, another important factor is its scalability, which is supposed to make it possible for millions to billions of transactions per second to take place across the network. After Lightning Network’s software lnd 0.4-beta version rolled out for the very first time in March, Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs, developer of the network, said that “Bitcoin enthusiasts have gotten excited about this, merchants are excited about this. It feels like we’re right on the edge of mass cryptocurrency adoption.” More good news Meanwhile, more positive news for crypto come from the cannabis publication High Times: it seems that they are accepting crypto for their current initial public offering (IPO) after all. Their representative Jon Cappetta told CoinDesk that the filing, stating that they would not be accepting bitcoin and ether, was made “to make the SEC [the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] happy.” “We're accepting [cryptocurrencies] as a payment option, but technically Fund America takes the bitcoin and ethereum,” Cappetta was quoted as saying. High Times, which has been a mouthpiece for the pro-cannabis community since 1974, had previously claimed that “with a magazine and online presence still going strong, many are eager to grab some shares.”",2018-09-06
" If you haven’t checked cryptocurrency prices in the past 24 hours, you’re in for a shock: the market as a whole is down, many coins having lost at least 10%, but most of them often double than that. At the time of writing, out of the top 100 coins by market capitalization, even stablecoins have taken a nosedive. The community is struggling to explain this uncharacteristic phenomenon. A few main theories took hold of the community: the first is that the drop happened because of the news that Goldman Sachs is ditching plans for crypto. The second is that Bitcoin was being dumped on several cryptocurrency exchanges, most notably BitMEX.  Roughly half of this last $BTC dump's volume on @bitfinex was margin short sells after the iceberg at $6.9k was pulled: pic.twitter.com/dO5O8KSXTZ The third - and most prevailing one - is that this is simple market manipulation. Also, others are discussing whether it might be a bull trap, or a false signal indicating that a declining trend in a price of an asset has reversed and is heading upwards when, in fact, the price will continue to decline.  The manipulation theory brought out some interesting ideas: Twitter user @bechokoy_betts argues that “this is why decentralized markets don’t work in a sense.” Others argue that the volatility has nothing to do with decentralization, but that this volatility will drive out any possibility of a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF) approval soon. “How can we ever grow as a community or prove to the SEC [The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] or anyone the crypto market is safe? Think what you want, today’s drop is clearly market manipulation,” writes Reddit user u/cryptocrew72. However, the Reddit community is not so easily persuaded: user u/mrcartel708 simply says, “If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen,” to the approval of many others.  Still, everyone is a little uneasy in the face of the upcoming bitcoin ETF decision. This is where the theory about the Goldman Sachs decision comes into play: many believe that the market’s steep fall is in response to that, and that Wall Street is giving up on crypto. CNBC Television talked to experts about what Bitcoin’s next catalyst and whether the ETF still has a chance of happening. The biggest problem for Goldman, they say, is the fact that it would be hard for them to get institutional investors on board with crypto integration. Meanwhile, Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp., told Bloomberg that a lot of retail investors’ hopes for a bigger institutional presence were really being driven by Goldman Sachs: “This is just a negative, negative sign as far as liquidity goes.” According to him, the next key level to watch for Bitcoin is USD 5,000, while a drop below that threshold may cause losses to accelerate. “It will either rain tomorrow ... or it will not rain”  The second theory about crypto, especially Bitcoin, being dumped is the one that ties into both of the previous ones: no matter which reason initially brought the prices down, the dump likely followed as a result of panic selling, the community believes. However, those in favor of the manipulation theory believe that even the news of Goldman surfaced just in time to hide a dump by a whale, instead leaving the community to blame the market drop on Wall Street. Whatever the reason for the red market, people would like to know where the decline ends and whether brighter days can be expected. One of the most popular ways in traditional trading is through technical analysis (TA). However, famous crypto trader Ronnie Moas took to Twitter to poke fun at TAs, saying that, “on that chart BTC may even be overbought and poised for a reversal ... or maybe it is going higher ... or it will flat-line.” He explains that this is the same as saying, “It will either rain tomorrow ... or it will not rain.”  TA is like handing over your Autonomous car control based on the car's rear cameras. Other than just poking fun at the mental image of analysts scrambling around and trying to make sense of charts and graphs, the community is coming together through their sense of humor as well. “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything,” has become the new unofficial motto of the current drop - an appropriation of the recent controversial Nike ad that featured Colin Kaepernick, an American football player, and sparked a heated debate in the US. Another example is this gif, which pretty much sums up the state of the market right now.  Meanwhile, Tuur Demeester, a popular economist and bitcoin-investor, took a chance on Twitter to remind his previous forecast that new highs for bitcoin are unlikely this year.  In the same thread, he also expressed his negative opinion towards ether: Since I wrote this 2yrs ago, ETH retraced almost all of its gains vs. BTC. Ethereum today is bloated, centralized, with hardly credible scaling plans, while Bitcoin is more lean and robust than ever, growing in many directions via 2nd layer scaling and institutional adoption. pic.twitter.com/YNX4W3l7uf On a brighter note: the internet’s favorite joke crypto, Dogecoin, has overtaken OmiseGO and is currently the 21st coin by market cap.

" Yesterday, we discussed an important resistance zone near USD 7,400. Bitcoin failed to surpass the stated resistance and tumbled more than USD 1,000 during the past three sessions. BTC/USD is down roughly 15% and broke key supports like USD 7,100, USD 6,800, USD 6,500 and USD 6,400. Similarly, there were heavy declines noted in major altcoins like ethereum, bitcoin cash, ripple, litecoin, eos, neo and ICON. It seems like the market sentiment turned bearish and the last fifteen days gains were trimmed in a single day. Meanwhile, a few main theories took hold of the community, who's trying to understand what's going on in the market - read about them here. Total market capitalization Bitcoin
The USD 7,400 resistance proved worth as bitcoin price reacted to the downside and declined heavily. BTC/USD sellers took control and pushed the price towards the USD 6,250 support. The price is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) consolidating gains above USD 6,250, but it remains at a risk of more losses.
On the downside, a break below the USD 6,250 support could push the price back towards the USD 6,000 handle. On the flip side, if the price corrects higher, it could face a strong resistance near the USD 6,500 and USD 6,600 levels. Ethereum
Ethereum price broke the last major support at USD 250 and traded to a new multi month low near USD 210. ETH/USD is under a lot of bearish pressure and it seems like sellers could push the price towards the USD 200 handle.
On the upside, buyers are likely to face a lot of selling interest close to the USD 240 and USD 250 levels in the near term.  Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash price trimmed most of its last week’s gain and declined more than USD 100. BCH/USD is down around 22% and it broke the USD 550 and USD 520 support levels. It is now trading near the USD 500 level with an immediate support at USD 480. On the upside, resistances are at USD 520 and 530.
Ripple price broke the USD 0.300 and 0.280 supports before buyers appeared near USD 0.265. XRP/USD is currently correcting higher towards the USD 0.288 and USD 0.295 resistance levels. Other altcoins market today
During the recent decline, many small cap altcoins tumbled between 20%-30%, including IOST, BCN, STRAT, BTCD, NPXS, NAS, WTC, BAT, ELF, GAS, NANO, GNT, DGB and DASH. Clearly, bitcoin and altcoins suffered heavy losses during the past few hours. The market sentiment changed to bearish and if BTC/USD fails to stay above the USD 6,250 and USD 6,000 support levels, there could be more declines in the coming days. More importantly, a close below USD 200 in ETH/USD may well put a lot of pressure on other altcoins.  _____

This does not mean the giant is moving out of the cryptocurrency space for good: they are still working on a custody product for cryptocurrency holders, as Bloomberg reported last month. According to one of the sources, executives have come to the conclusion that many steps still need to be taken before a regulated bank would be allowed to trade cryptocurrencies - mostly outside of their control.

To the topside, the USD 7,400 and USD 7,500 levels are crucial hurdles for buyers. Therefore, the next move depends whether buyers are able to push the price above these levels. On the other hand, there was a minor downward move in major altcoins like ethereum, bitcoin cash and ripple, but they all are still trading above key supports. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price gained more than 1% recently and tested the USD 7,400 resistance. BTC/USD is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) trading with bullish moves above the previous resistance (now support) at USD 7,350. However, buyers need to push the price above the USD 7,400 barrier and then USD 7,500. Both are important resistances for a move towards the USD 8,000 handle.
If buyers fail, there could be a downside correction towards the USD 7,250 and USD 7,050 support levels in the near term. Ethereum
Ethereum price could not settle above the USD 290 resistance and it slowly declined. ETH/USD is down around 1%, but it is still trading above the USD 275 support, which is a positive sign.
Buyers need to gain momentum above the USD 290 resistance for more upsides towards USD 300 and USD 310 in the short term.  Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash price remained confined in a tiny range above the USD 620 support. BCH/USD needs to break the USD 640 and USD 650 resistances to start a fresh upward move. On the other hand, a break below the USD 620 range support could ignite bearish moves in the near term towards USD 600 and USD 580.
Ripple price seems to be struggling to gain buying interest and it is currently down more than 1.2% to USD 0.328. XRP/USD could continue to move down towards the next supports at USD 0.325 and USD 0.323. Other altcoins market today
The market sentiment was mostly positive for small cap altcoins like dropil, STRAT and bytecoin, PIVX, MOAC, NPXS, GAS, MCO and PAY. Out of these dropil climbed around 17% and STRAT gained roughly 12%. To sum up, bitcoin price remains in an uptrend above the USD 7,250 support. However, buyers are likely to face a lot of selling interest near the USD 7,400 and USD 7,500 resistance levels. Should there be a close above USD 7,500, there could be solid gains in BTC and altcoins in the coming days.

" Initial coin offering advisory firm Satis Group predicts Bitcoin’s price could reach USD 144,000 within the next decade and USD 96,000 in half that time, but the crypto community is getting less gullible. “Someone with a bias makes a guess,” is how Reddit user u/bahkins313 sums up the reaction from the rest of the community. These predictions were reached by starting at the assumption that the more tokens are in circulation, the less their value. The research also estimates a constant increase in price, but claims “conservative” estimates in general. In short, it relies on a price prediction based on underlying value rather than speculation. “Cryptoassets which apply unique value propositions within deep and viral markets” should spike, and these include Bitcoin, Monero and Decred among others, while Bcash will drop as it is a “cryptoasset which attempts to inherit brand recognition and provide minimal technological advantage to incumbents.” The prices that should see the biggest drop, according to the document, are Stellar, Ripple and Cardano; Monero is estimated to reach close to USD 40,000 within the decade, and Ethereum should see about a double increase in price, but neither a spike nor a drop like the others. The crypto community sarcastically calls this a “Monero shill” and generally consider it “a**talkery.” On Twitter, user @Mr_Rupee says, “The good part of making 10 year prediction is no one will remember to question you after 10 years....” Of course, there are always those shilling their own coins that they claim will replace existing ones. Some people simply call Satis Group “scammers.” Twitter user @0xPineapple writes, “No one has ever successfully applied quantity theory of money to cryptoassets and shown meaningful real world correlation. I suppose it could be an instructive thought exercise in the absence of proven frameworks. Are these guys pivoting away from ICO services?”, while @njderuiter says, “@SatisGroup is the same group that claimed 80% of ICOs were scams. Nobody bothered to check their flawed research, where factors they chose to define whether something would be labelled as such were either extremely vague, or simply ridiculous. But hey, it fits the narrative!” Still, Satis Group is hardly the only one with bullish predictions. Tim Draper, famous early investor in groundbreaking projects such as the internet, Tesla, Skype and Hotmail among others is famed for his prediction that BTC will reach USD 250,000 within four years. John McAfee, a self proclaimed “crypto visionary” and software tycoon, predicted that Bitcoin would reach USD 1 million by the end of 2020, or he will eat his… private parts. Tom Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, is more conservative, but still estimates BTC may go above USD 20,000 by the end of this year, while Phillip Nunn, a high-profile blockchain consultant, online influencer and popular public speaker, estimated that the end of the year will see BTC at USD 60,000.

" Russian enthusiasm for cryptocurrency mining appears to be intensifying – although there are plenty of risks still involved. As previously reported on Cryptonews.com, mining has become significantly less profitable in the past few months due to a range of factors, but this seems to have done very little to dampen the enthusiasm many Russians currently feel for cryptocurrencies and mining. The number of new companies created to mine tokens in Russia has risen by 15% since the start of this year, despite an estimated 90% drop in profitability. Earlier this week, the governor of the Leningrad Oblast (the area surrounding St Petersburg) claimed the province had opened a 4,000sqm mining facility kitted out with 3,000 units of mining equipment. The governor stated that the facility’s energy capacity was 20mW, and had cost over USD 7 million to construct. The development’s owners have claimed the mine is the country’s largest, and was built on the grounds of a former Soviet-era fertilizer factory that had stood vacant for 20 years. Meanwhile, CryptoUniverse, a Russian mining specialist that trades directly with Chinese mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain, has opened a sales office in Novosibirsk, Siberia. Per news outlet Novosibirsk Online, the company already has offices in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Irkutsk, and says it will now allow Novosibirsk-based customers to buy their mining hardware directly. Siberian electricity prices are among the lowest in the world. The federal district has recently seen a mine whose capacity could reach up to 120 megawatts thermal (mWt) open in Divnogorsk, whereas its infrastructure costs were expected to be around 3 billion rubles (USD 44 million).  However, in Ufa, the capital of the Russian federal subject Republic of Bashkortostan, police have arrested a 33-year-old man, accusing him of conning 14 Ufa residents aged 45 to 62 out of over a total of some USD 265,000. Per media outlet Pravda, the suspect claimed he was going to build a refuse processing plant and “fuel-free” electric generators – which could be used to power cryptocurrency mining hardware.",2018-08-30

" There’s a little-known correlation that may provide some clues as to where bitcoin is headed next, according to famous bitcoin bull Tom Lee, who still estimates that bitcoin can surpass USD 20,000 this year.  Lee,  who serves as the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said that the performance of emerging market stocks has correlated closely with the price of bitcoin since the beginning of 2017. Comparing the two markets, Lee, speaking on CNBC, said that “both really essentially peaked early this year, and they both have been in a downward trend.” “When emerging markets do well, it’s because we’re in a ‘risk-on’ environment, and when it does poorly it’s because we’re in a ‘risk-off’ environment,” Lee explained, adding that he doesn’t believe bitcoin will rise until traders with a ‘risk-on’ mentality are back. Comparing the two charts below, a correlation can definitely be spotted, with bitcoin (bottom chart) peaking about a month before the MSCI Emerging Markets Index (top chart).  However, it could be argued that emerging market stocks have declined because their currencies have been in decline, such as the situation is with the Turkish lira. And as we have seen in both Turkey, and to an even greater extent in Venezuela, weaker national currencies tend to increase demand for bitcoin. While Lee agrees with this, he explained that the majority of bitcoin trading is not taking place in emerging markets, but rather in countries like South Korea, Japan, China, the US, and Europe.

" Despite the push to get a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF) approved in the US this year, chances now seem slim, as little has changed since the rejection of the Winklevoss ETF. Speaking about the bitcoin futures contracts that the proposed ETFs intend to hold, Chris Matta, co-founder of Crescent Crypto Asset Management told Bloomberg that “the markets are small and the volumes on some of these exchanges are low, which makes it such that manipulation is possible.” “[…] That’s their major concern, and without having any sort of regulatory body stepping in and policing people doing that, it’s always a possibility. A bitcoin ETF will not start trading this year,” the crypto fund manager said. The only proposed ETF backed by “physical” bitcoins, the VanEck bitcoin ETF, is therefore widely considered to have a better chance at getting approved, given the fact that the market for “physical” bitcoins is much deeper and more liquid than the futures market. However, the decision on that ETF may be pushed as far back as February next year. As reported by Cryptonews.com, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will take a second look at its decision from last week to reject bitcoin ETF proposals from three US-based providers. The decision to review the rejections, that were made by SEC staff members, and not by the four commissioners at the SEC, appears to have been pushed by commissioner Hester Peirce, who tweeted that the decision is “stayed pending Commission review.” Hester Peirce, who was the only commissioner to vote in favor of the proposed Winklevoss bitcoin ETF, has over the recent months argued extensively for the approval of a bitcoin-based ETF. In a lengthy piece that explained her thinking, Peirce wrote that “I reject the role of gatekeeper of innovation.”",2018-08-27
" If you count yourself among the victims of the infamous Mt Gox exchange hack, there’s good news for you: you can now file your rehabilitation claim. The filing can be done both online and offline by post, and the deadline is October 22nd, 2018.  Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee of Mt Gox, announced in a note that the online claim filing system is now up and running, but strictly for individuals: claims for corporate creditors will have to be filed at a later date. Users who lost their login credentials will have to use the offline method. This includes sending proofs to an address in Tokyo designated by the Mt Gox trustee.  A separate Q&A document says that, “The planned deadline for the Rehabilitation Trustee to submit a statement of approval or rejection to the court is January 24, 2019, but, at the current point in time, a definite date has not been determined.” Mt Gox online rehabilitation claim filing system can be found here.

" Bitcoin stayed above the USD 6,250 support despite massive negative sentiment after yesterday’s US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejection news. BTC/USD declined, but it stayed above the USD 6,250 support and is currently correcting higher above the USD 6,400 level. Similarly, there was a decent support base formed for major altcoins like ethereum, ripple, EOS and bitcoin cash. If bitcoin price continues to hold the USD 6,400 and USD 6,250 supports, it could stage a solid rise in the coming days. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price stayed above the USD 6,250 support level and is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) rebounding. BTC/USD has already moved above the USD 6.400 resistance, which is a positive sign. Going forward, a break and close above the USD 6,600 level is likely to clear the path for more gains in the near term.
Above USD 6,600, the price may perhaps surge above the 6,800 level. On the downside, the USD 6,250 support holds a lot of significance, below which, the price might test USD 6,050. Ethereum
Ethereum price tested the USD 260 level and is currently correcting higher above the USD 270 level. If ETH/USD moves above the USD 280 - USD 285 zone, there could be a solid rise towards USD 300 and USD 310.
On the downside, an initial support is near the USD 260 level, below which, the price may well test the USD 250 low in the near term. Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash price is currently consolidating above the USD 520 level and it seems to be preparing for an upside move. BCH/USD has to move above the USD 540 and USD 550 resistance levels to climb further higher towards the USD 580 level. Supports are seen near USD 520 and USD 500.
Ripple price is slightly struggling and is currently trading near the USD 0.3220 level. A break above the USD 0.3350 level is needed for buyers to gain momentum above the USD 0.35 level. Other altcoins market today
Two small cap altcoins, THETA and CMT rallied today by 51% and 38%. Moreover, other coins like BCD, EMC, nano, PIVX and AION also gained more than 10%.

" The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to take a second look at Wednesday’s decision to reject proposed bitcoin-based exchange traded funds (ETFs) from three providers, according to a tweet from pro-bitcoin ETF commissioner Hester Peirce. In English: the Commission (Chairman and Commissioners) delegates some tasks to its staff.  When the staff acts in such cases, it acts on behalf of the Commission.  The Commission may review the staff's action, as will now happen here. In the tweet, Peirce explained that the decision to reject the proposals from ETF providers GraniteShares, ProShares, and Direxion was not made by the commissioners, but instead by the SEC’s staff as a routine matter, and that the SEC’s four commissioners now intend to review the staff’s decision. In an official letter from the SEC, the secretary of the Commission wrote that the “[…] order is stayed until the Commission orders otherwise,” without specifying any timeline for the review. Important to point out is that all the ETFs in question this time are intended to be backed by bitcoin futures contracts, meaning they will not be linked to the market for physical bitcoins. On September 30, the SEC is set to announce if they will approve, disapprove, or further delay a decision on the much-discussed ETF proposal, which is geared towards institutional investors, from financial firm VanEck. So far, this is the only provider that has filed a proposal for an ETF backed by physical bitcoins, which is considered to be far more important. Hester Peirce became the crypto community’s favorite SEC commissioner back in July when she was the only commissioner to vote in favor of the proposed Winklevoss bitcoin ETF, which was rejected by a majority of the commissioners. Peirce later justified her vote by writing in a letter that “I reject the role of gatekeeper of innovation.” Today, the Republican SEC commissioner once again received praise from the crypto community for standing up for innovation. You're the best!  thanks for being a great voice to all of us in the CryptoCurrency space!  Cheers!",2018-08-24
" In a series of three separate decisions published on the website of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday, the community learned that proposals to set up a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF) from three ETF providers had been rejected. Despite this decision was expected, the price of bitcoin still reacted by trading lower overnight, essentially falling back to the level from before Wednesday’s short squeeze. The three ETF providers in question are GraniteShares, ProShares, and Direxion, all well-established providers of ETFs in the US. Each of them had filed proposals for several funds, offering both long and short exposure to the price of bitcoin. Important to point out is that all of the funds rejected were intended to be backed by bitcoin futures contracts, without holding any physical bitcoins. Considering the SECs past objections to these types of funds, it was already largely expected that these proposals would be rejected. A bitcoin futures-backed ETF would have no direct link to the underlying market for physical bitcoins, and the community is divided, discussing how an ETF could affect the Bitcoin ecosystem and what harm it might cause. On September 30, the SEC is set to announce if they will approve, disapprove, or further delay a decision on the much-discussed ETF proposal, which is geared towards institutional investors, from financial firm VanEck. So far, this is the only provider that has filed a proposal for an ETF backed by physical bitcoins, which is considered to be far more important. It is widely expected that the SEC will delay that decision until early 2019. Previously, the president of the Chicago Board Options Exchange said that a bitcoin ETF faces what can best be described as a “chicken-and-egg problem.” He explained that the SEC has rejected bitcoin ETFs because the bitcoin futures market is not a “market of significant size.” However, the best way increase trading volumes in the market would be to introduce an ETF based on it.",2018-08-23
" If you’ve been wondering how many bitcoins Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, himself owns, you're not alone - a new research by the BitMEX exchange has attempted to answer exactly this question. Despite they recognize that their ""analysis is far from perfect"", the researchers estimate that Satoshi had mined up to 700,000 bitcoins in 2009, or less than previously estimated a million of coins. The BitMEX research blog specializes in analysis of the crypto space. This time, their attempt at finding out how much a single dominant miner could have generated back in the beginnings of the cryptocurrency was inspired by blockchain researcher Sergio Demian Lerner. In 2013, he claimed that Satoshi had mined a million bitcoins in 2009. “Our analysis is far from perfect and we used a variety of methods [...] We will have made many errors and we do not claim our methodology is robust or scientific. However, as far as we are aware, this is the first attempt to allocate every block in 2009 as belonging to the apparent single entity or not,” the blog states. What they found was that up to August 2009, there is a pattern indicating a single dominant miner, but after this period, the pattern breaks down. However, this pattern could also indicate several miners with similar setups: “Each miner is not independent, in the sense that they are likely to be running the same software or could be using the same popular hardware, which could produce the same pattern.” There is still strong evidence of a dominant miner in 2009. However, the blog goes on to say that the evidence is “far less robust than many have assumed.” Also, it is quite possible that the dominant miner was not Satoshi at all, “although we know Satoshi mined block 9, which we have allocated to the dominant miner in our analysis.” In short, even if Satoshi was the dominant miner from 2009 - he probably didn’t go for a whole million, as “600,000 to 700,000 bitcoin is a better estimate,” according to BitMEX. However, even if the number is more or less accurate, it would be even harder to find out how many coins Satoshi owns now.  ""Whoever the dominant miner was, it is of course possible the keys have been lost or discarded by now,"" the researchers added.

" Bitcoin formed a crucial support near the USD 6,250 level and bounced back. BTC/USD climbed above key hurdles near the USD 6,500 and USD 6,600 levels to move into a positive zone. The price traded close to the USD 7,000 level and it is currently correcting lower. It seems there was a short squeeze in bitcoin considering shorts positions were near all-time highs. Similarly, major altcoins like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and eos bounced back and traded above a few important resistances.  Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price gained bullish momentum and traded above the USD 6,600 resistance. There was a break above the USD 6,900 level before sellers appeared. The price started a downside correction and traded below USD 6,800. 
However, there are any supports on the downside near the USD 6,600 level, which was a resistance earlier. Therefore, if the price continues to move down, buyers are likely to appear near the USD 6,600 and USD 6,500 levels. Ethereum
Ethereum price surged above the USD 275 and USD 290 resistance. However, ETH/USD sellers defended more gains above the USD 300 level. The price trimmed most of its gains and is currently trading near the USD 285 level (UTC 08:20 AM).
It seems like the price is trading in a range above the USD 275 level with key resistances near the USD 290 and USD 300 levels. Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash price surged above the USD 560 level and traded towards the USD 580 level. BCH/USD is currently up around 4% and is trading near the USD 550 level. On the downside, supports are sitting near USD 540 and USD 520 level.
Ripple price spiked, but it failed near the USD 0.350 level. XRP/USD is currently up around 3% to USD 0.338 and it could bounce back towards USD 0.345 and USD 0.350 in the near term. Other altcoins market today
The recent spike boosted the market sentiment, which helped many small cap altcoins like cortex, WTC, KNC, NULS, nano, VET, AOA, RHOC, PIVX and populous. Overall, bitcoin’s price recent bounce is encouraging, but it would be interesting to see if buyers can retain momentum or not. If the price remains above the USD 6,600 support, there could be more gains in BTC and altcoins in the near term.

" In a move that several market observers described as a short-squeeze, the price of bitcoin spiked more than 5% during a period of only 5 minutes in the early hours of the Asian trading session on Wednesday. The price later pulled back slightly, but has still maintained the majority of the gains from the sudden spike. Today’s short squeeze was by many already expected to occur due to the unusually high number of bitcoin short positions in the market. On the Bitfinex exchange, the ratio of bitcoin short to bitcoin long positions reached 1.4 on August 15, the highest level since November last year. Since then, the short-to-long ratio has continued to climb, reaching a high of 1.5 on Tuesday. Today’s spike in bitcoin prices, however, was accompanied by a sharp fall in short positions, indicating that the move was at least partially driven by traders exiting their short positions. When traders exit their short positions, often referred to as short covering, they have to buy back bitcoins in the open market, which can sometimes cause large price increases. And with the short-to-long ratio still at very high levels not seen since last year, the action may not be over quite yet. According to a Bloomberg interview on Wednesday, Timothy Tam, CEO at cryptocurrency data analysis firm CoinFi, “when there’s a record number of shorts, if there’s a large explosive price movement up like this, it means people will need to cover their shorts quite quickly,” adding that “it’s almost like a domino effect.”",2018-08-22
" With the next deadline for a decision on a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) looming around the corner, let’s take a closer look at what an ETF could mean for the bitcoin market and why the bitcoin community is divided. First of all, it’s important to realize that not all ETFs are the same. Out of the 10 ETFs currently being reviewed by the SEC, only one will actually hold physical bitcoins in its reserves. That one is the much-talked about VanEck bitcoin ETF that was filed through the CBOE exchange earlier this year. The other nine ETF proposals on the SECs table are not backed by bitcoin, but instead backed by futures contracts of bitcoin. In the US, bitcoin futures contracts are traded at two major futures exchanges in Chicago known as CBOE and CME.  What Is a Bitcoin Futures Contract? Futures contracts were originally designed for farmers and other commodity producers to lock in prices of the commodities they wished to trade at a future date. When that date came, the holder and the issuer of the contract would settle it by having the commodity physically delivered to the person holding the contract. Bitcoin futures, however, are structured in a way that has no link to the actual market for bitcoin. Instead of having bitcoins delivered to the person holding the contract when it expires, the contract is settled in cash, without any bitcoins ever changing hands. Despite this, some experts have claimed that bitcoin futures have caused greater volatility in the bitcoin market, in particular on the days the contracts expire. Do Futures-Based ETFs Matter? Although a futures-based ETF wouldn’t hold any bitcoins, it can still be argued that it is good for the bitcoin market because it spreads knowledge about bitcoin to new types of investors who may choose to buy physical bitcoins at some point in the future. It would also legitimize the asset even more in the eyes of traditional Wall Street investors and financial institutions, and most likely lead to the creation of more bitcoin-based investment products in the future. That said, most experts agree that an ETF backed by physical bitcoins would by far be the most impactful event for the price of bitcoin both in the short and long run. Community Is Divided Some members of the bitcoin community, including technologist and serial entrepreneur Andreas Antonopoulos, are against Wall Street money pouring into bitcoin in the form of an ETF. “I think it's a terrible idea. <...> ETFs fundamentally violate the underlying principle of peer-to-peer money, where each user is operating not through custodian, but has a direct control of their money, because they have direct control of their keys. Your keys - your bitcoin, not your keys - not your bitcoin,” Antonopoulous warned adding that Bitcoin ETF will become an instrument to manipulate bitcoin prices, scaling and forking debates.  Nick Szabo, a famous computer scientist, legal scholar and cryptographer, also shares the same viewpoint, arguing that it “might cause more problems than it’s worth.” I for one am not lobbying for an ETF or for Wall Street-managed money in general. It might cause more problems than it's worth. The recent sell-off by dumb money has or soon will deprecate many opinionated know-nothings in this space. We don't need new ones to take their place. https://t.co/s7OxZt9IrJ Others, however, argue that a regulated investment product such as an ETF is the only way for bitcoin to truly catch on as a mainstream asset class globally, saying that “people do not want self-custody.” Because most people do Not want to self custody. The only people in crypto now are power users, developers and traders. If you wan this to be a global thing, then they will want something that is easy and regulated. That’s facts. The next deadline for the SEC to decide on a bitcoin ETF is Thursday August 23, when it is set to decide the fate of a proposal from ProShares, a well-established provider of ETFs in the US. ProShares’ proposal includes two ETFs, one that would let investors bet on the bitcoin price going up, and another that would offer short exposure, meaning investors can profit when the bitcoin price goes down. Physical Futures Coming With the link between the bitcoin futures market and the physical market being weak at best, a new start-up dubbed Bakkt is trying to change this by introducing 1-day physically delivered bitcoin futures contracts in November this year. With our solution the buying and selling of bitcoin is fully collateralized or pre-funded. Our new daily bitcoin contract will not be traded on margin, use leverage or serve to create a paper claim on a real asset. The new company, set up by heavyweight financial institution Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) has already received investments from crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital, and is working with major brands like Microsoft, BCG, and Starbucks on developing the platform, which Wall Street veteran Mike Novogratz referred to as “the most important news in crypto this year.”",2018-08-22
" Bitcoin buyers failed once again to surpass the USD 6,500 and USD 6,600 resistance levels. BTC/USD declined and broke the USD 6,400 support to test the next support at USD 6,250 where buyers appeared. More importantly, there was a solid rise in selling pressure on ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash. ETH/USD broke the USD 295 and USD 285 support levels to move into a bearish zone. The current price action indicates that bitcoin and altcoins failed to gain momentum above key resistances (as discussed in yesterday’s market outlook), resulting in a bearish reaction. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price came under renewed selling pressure and declined below the USD 6,400 support. BTC/USD tested a crucial support near the USD 6,250 level, which acted as a solid buy zone. The price is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) correcting higher, but the broken supports at USD 6,400 and USD 6,500 are likely to act as resistances.
If buyers fail to push the price above the USD 6,500 resistance, it could decline once again. On the downside, the USD 6,250 support holds a lot of importance, below which, the price may perhaps test the USD 6,000 level. Ethereum
Ethereum declined sharply after sellers managed to push the price below the USD 300 support. ETH/USD dropped below the USD 290 and USD 285 support levels to move into a bearish zone.
The price tested the USD 270 level and it is currently rebounding. However, the previous supports at USD 285 and USD 290 are likely to act as major barriers for buyers. Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash price managed to stay above the USD 520 support. However, BCH/USD seems to be facing many hurdles on the upside near the USD 560 and USD 580 levels. On the flip side, a break below the USD 520 support could ignite bearish moves towards USD 500 and USD 480.
Ripple price tested the USD 0.320 support area and is currently recovering towards USD 0.340. Above this, XRP/USD may possibly test the USD 0.350 resistance in the near term. Other Altcoins Market Today
The market sentiment turned short-term bearish, pressuring many small cap altcoins like tezos, VERI, AOA, KCS, BTCP, kin, populous, XZC, funfair, cortex, RDD and RHOC (all declined between 8%-16%). Overall, bitcoin has to move above the USD 6,400 and USD 6,500 resistance levels to overcome selling pressure.

" In a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of California, a 21-year-old bitcoin dealer was identified and “ordered held without bail” on charges of him operating an “illegal money transmitting business” in the United States. As part of his bitcoin exchange business, the young man, identified as Jacob Burrel Campos, accepted cash payments in person, through his bank account, and through MoneyGram, while failing to comply with anti-money laundering requirements. According to the document from the US Attorney’s Office, he had a “no questions asked” policy towards his customers, and charged a 5% exchange fee for his services. He is also accused of sending over USD 900,000 from his bank account to “a bank account in Taiwan in the name of Bitfinex,” and then using those funds to buy bitcoins in order to operate his business. For this, the young California man is charged with 28 counts of international money laundering, carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Jacob Burrel Campos was arrested on August 13 this year as he was entering the US from Mexico. Noting that Burrel has “citizenship in three countries, no steady employment in the United States, and the ability to access large sums of cash,” authorities concluded that there was a significant risk of him fleeing and that he should be held without bail. In another case earlier this year, a Texas man admitted that he had used customer deposits on a bitcoin platform he operated for his own personal expenses, and that he had lied to customers about a hack on his platform back in 2013. The former bitcoin exchange operator is now facing up to 20 years in prison under US federal laws.",2018-08-20
" Bitcoin started a slow and steady rise after testing the USD 6,250 support area. BTC/USD is trading with positive signs above USD 6,400 and it seems like the price could accelerate above the USD 6,500 resistance in the near term. Similarly, ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin and neo traded higher with bullish moves. The current market sentiment is signaling more upsides as long as bitcoin price is trading above the USD 6,250 support. Total market capitalization: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price remained in an uptrend from the USD 6,000 swing low and it recently settled above USD 6,250. BTC/USD is currently up around 1% with the immediate resistance at USD 6,500 (UTC 08:20 AM). Above this, the price is likely to climb towards the USD 6,700 and USD 6,800 resistance levels.
On the other hand, if there is a downside correction, the USD 6,250 support zone could act as a strong barrier for sellers. Below this, the price will most likely retest the USD 6,000 support area. Ethereum
Ethereum is currently up more than 3% and is trading near the USD 300 - USD 305 resistance zone. If ETH/USD settles above the stated resistance zone, it could continue to rise towards the USD 330 level.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 290 followed by USD 284. Below this last, the price may perhaps test the USD 260 support level. Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash is slowly rising towards the USD 540 resistance. If BCH/USD clears the USD 540 resistance, it might accelerate above USD 550 to test the USD 565 resistance. On the downside, there are decent supports near the USD 520 and USD 505 levels.

" Following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's evasion of the Bitcoin ETF question, an alternative is now being offered to US investors. A Bitcoin-based ETN (exchange traded note) listed on Nasdaq Stockholm exchange is being quoted in dollars since Wednesday, under the ticker CXBTF. ETNs are close cousins to ETFs (exchange traded funds), but there are some key differences. ETNs are structured products that are issued as senior debt notes, while ETFs represent a stake in an underlying commodity. ETNs are more like bonds in that they are unsecured. ETFs provide investments into a fund that holds the assets it tracks, like stocks, bonds or gold. The Bitcoin ETN has been trading on the Swedish stock exchange since 2015, but was only offered in euros and kronas, Sweden’s native currency. As it is now quoted in dollars, this is an attempt to market it towards US investors - if investors can convince their brokerage account providers to make the Bitcoin ETN available on their platforms. “Everyone that’s investing in dollars can now get exposure to these products, whereas before, they were only available in euros or Swedish krona. Given the current climate on the regulatory front in the U.S., this is a big win for Bitcoin,” CEO of CoinShares Holdings, Ryan Radloff, told Bloomberg. The product is dubbed Bitcoin Tracker One, and according to Bloomberg, trading it is “similar to buying an American depositary receipt, in that traders will see a foreign-listed asset in US dollars.” Although trades will be done in dollars, everything else will take place in the Swedish market. Although it is speculated that a Bitcoin ETF would most likely send the price of the cryptocurrency upwards, the ETN announcement is not expected to have the same effect.  Also, as reported, the largest ETN trader in Europe, Amsterdam-based Flow Traders NV, is now making the first move into this market as it aims to profit from high-frequency trading of ETNs based on bitcoin and ethereum.",2018-08-17
" Cloud mining operator Genesis Mining is terminating customers who are unable to cover their “service fee” because of low mining profitability.  In an email to their clients, the company writes that the decline in bitcoin prices that started in January have coincided with “heavily rising difficulty” of bitcoin mining in April in May. “As a result,” the company writes, “some user contracts are now mining less than the daily maintenance fee requires to be covered, and thus they entered the 60 days grace period, after which open-ended contracts will get terminated.” Also, the company has offered a USD 105 discount to existing customers after upgrading to its premium service, known as Radiant. Cloud mining is the process of hosting mining hardware for clients in a remote location in exchange for a fixed fee usually denominated in fiat currency. This way, the cloud mining operator takes virtually no risk, while the client is left with the risk of the mining contract becoming unprofitable due to increasing mining difficulty or lower cryptocurrency prices. Although Genesis Mining’s FAQ section does specify that the company reserves the right to terminate a contract should the mining rewards of the contract be insufficient to cover the service fee, many users have voiced their frustration with the company. The company is now requesting existing users to upgrade their contracts in order to continue mining with Genesis, but has received mixed reactions from the community. Some are wondering why the company is now asking for more money to pay for the same hashrate as they had before: Strange you make it sound like I can upgrade my current btc contract, but in fact I’m paying paying twice for the same hashrate!? 🤔 the real deal would be if you gave us the option to convert our contracts without extra costs! #unbelievable Others, however, are questioning the company’s customer service: I am an early BTC customer! I'm so glad you can hear me! 😆SO HEAR THIS: MY TICKET #226915 REGARDING 0.1 BTC YOU ERASED FROM MY BALANCE WITHOUT SENDING TO MY WALLET IS OVER 1 YEAR OLD AND YOU STILL DIDN'T REFUND ME OR OFFERED A NEW CONTRACT IN THAT VALUE! DID YOU HEAR THAT? The company replied that “When you're asking us to upgrade you for free, technically you're asking us to connect you to the new set of miners we built out and unplug your current hardware. This isn't sustainable.” 3/3 With this offer we want our old customers to get a fair price for new capacities, but we also understand if this is not feasible for everyone. We really hope the Bitcoin price will recover, and with it, your open ended BTC contracts. Thank you. As bitcoin hash rate — which measures computing power - is growing, so does mining difficulty.

Their idea is that since bitcoin has remained fairly stable over the past few days as the altcoins, including major coins like ether, litecoin, and EOS, have sold off heavily, it is bitcoin’s turn to fall next. Bitcoin price chart The relative strength that bitcoin has shown has also led to a spike in bitcoin’s overall dominance in the crypto market, recently reaching above 50% for the first time in 2018. Dominance rate Since the explosion in altcoin market capitalization occurred in mid-2017, bitcoin’s dominance rate has only reached the 50%-level for one brief period between late October and early December 2017. As such, traders may now be expecting to see bitcoin’s dominance fall again. However, many traders also know that when “everyone” in a market believes something is about to happen, history shows that the opposite instead tends to occur. Following that logic, a large number of short sellers in a market could in fact lead to higher prices – often in a very violent way. Bitcoin shorts reach record levels The total amount of BTC/USD short positions on the Bitfinex exchange is now reaching the highest levels in 12 months, while the short-to-long ratio is at its highest level since November 2017 at 1.3, as seen in the chart below: If the market starts to move upwards in the near future, many of these traders will exit their short positions by buying back bitcoins in the open market. As the price moves further up, even more short-sellers will get margin calls or hit their pre-set stop-loss levels, forcing them to cover their shorts, and creating a self-reinforcing mechanism that can cause sharp price increases. This is what traders refer to as a short squeeze. On Wednesday, Ran Neu-Ner, host of CNBC’s Cryptotrader show, also noted that bitcoin short positions are close to a 12-month high. He added that futures contracts traded at the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) are set to expire, which has previously caused extra volatility in the bitcoin market. Open short positions on Bitcoin are at a 12 month high today. There is also a CBOE futures close today. We could see a short squeeze again. pic.twitter.com/Yogyq7oAna Some, however, take the idea that “everyone” is now expecting a short squeeze one step further by questioning their logic in a poetic way: Shorts are up.Longs are down.A short squeeze expected,by everyone in town.What if the notion of a squeeze,is nothing but a tease?Hopium for the masses,before the $BTC floor collapses.Love,Zissou It remains to be seen if we will see a giant short squeeze in bitcoin, but don’t be surprised to see strong spikes in price if the market starts to move higher from the current low levels in the next few days.",2018-08-16
" The New York-based magazineHigh Times, famed for its pro-cannabis approach, now announced that they would not accept bitcoin in their upcoming initial public offering (IPO) that seeks to raise up to USD 50 million.  The company had previously said that they hope the addition of cryptocurrencies will “enable a much broader group of investors worldwide” to participate. The cryptocurrencies that the company meant to accept were bitcoin and ether. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, High Times clarified that the announcement was a mistake and that they would not be accepting bitcoin. The filing does not mention ether at all. The filing states, “This press release was distributed in error as the Company will not be accepting bitcoin as payment for shares. As provided in the Company's subscription agreement related to the offering, the Company will only be accepting check, credit card, ACH or wire transfer as payment for subscription to shares.” High Times, which has been a mouthpiece for the pro-cannabis community since 1974, had previously claimed that “with a magazine and online presence still going strong, many are eager to grab some shares.” The first IPO that accepts cryptocurrencies could help crypto adoption, as the IPO market is measured in billions of dollars. For example, the US IPO market rebounded in 2017 as 133 domestic companies went public raising USD 30.4 billion, 33 more IPOs and 79% greater value than the previous year, according to Mergermarket, M&A intelligence, data and research company. Cryptonews.com has previously reported on the race to put cannabis on the blockchain, and how the two industries indeed have much in common. The blockchain is supposed to be helpful in in confirming the compliance of pot that's grown and distributed throughout the US, Canada, and other nations. It will also be helpful in creating a reliable record of customer purchases and preferences, so that growers will know just what kind of cannabis to cultivate and market.",2018-08-15
" Chris Concannon, president and COO of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), explained that there are still obstacles that must be overcomed before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves the first bitcoin-backed exchange traded fund (ETF). “As we chip away at their issues to make them less concerned, at some point they’ll be comfortable with an ETF,” Concannon told Bloomberg. Speaking about bitcoin futures, Concannon noted that trading in bitcoin futures is still low compared to mature assets such as gold or oil. Insufficient trading volume, in turn, makes the SEC hesitant to approve an ETF, although the introduction of an ETF backed by futures would significantly increase the trading volume in the underlying futures contracts. “It’s a chicken-and-egg problem,” he said. Back in June, the CBOE filed a proposal for an ETF on behalf of financial firm VanEck. This is the only such ETF that aims to be fully backed by physical bitcoins rather than bitcoin futures contracts. Some experts claim that bitcoin custody is the crucial issue for bitcoin ETF. Meanwhile, nine other ETFs backed by bitcoin futures are also pending decisions by the SEC. The fact that the ETF was filed through a veteran financial institution such as the CBOE, and that it will hold real bitcoins in its reserves, has made the entire cryptocurrency community particularly excited about the prospects of this particular ETF. CBOEs boss, however, offered his own perspective on the crypto market by saying: “I’ve learned that there’s been more articles than volume. It’s a little bit shocking to me the attention this market gets versus its size. The entire crypto market is a fifth of Apple.”",2018-08-15
" With the bear market showing no signs of stopping - other than to offer a little hope and then trample all over it again - more HODLers are reconsidering their stance. The opinions on the merits of such an approach are more varied than ever, with representatives of each making a strong case for their view. In one corner are people who have given up on trying to HODL or are against this strategy in general. “One of the things I have disliked the most about the crypto sector is the idea that people should “hodl” or “hold on for dear life. I have written many times here at AVC that one should take profits when they are available and diversify an investment portfolio. The idea that an investor should hold on no matter what has always seemed ridiculous to me,” Fred Wilson, a New York-based famous venture capitalist, wrote in his blog AVC. He added that he can't say whether this is the ""long-awaited capitulation of the HODL crowd or not"", but ""capitulation would be a good thing for the crypto markets, releasing assets into the market that until now have been locked up by long-term holders.” Meanwhile, the social network Reddit is filled to bursting with posts such as: “The ‘HODL’ meme is a cancer in the cryptocurrency space,” or “You people HODLing-only, are your own worst enemy.” The most common argument is that HODLing doesn’t help the trading volume. “How do you expect to see volume and money coming in, when you don't want to contribute to it? It is literally the same thing as the bystander effect. ‘Oh I won't help, I'm sure someone else will’,” writes user u/PhillyCrypto. User u/niftythrow argues that, “HODL only works in a bull market.” The recently published survey showed that 70% of the respondents believe that hodling is more important than spending. Also, the survey found that with bitcoin, 73% spend it ‘almost never’, ethereum - 82%, and litecoin - 89%. 46% of the respondents are of the opinion that the lack of places o spend crypto contributed to the price decline. Meanwhile, others now argue that capitulating isn’t the way to go either. “If you can't stomach a negative asset, you're not for crypto,” says user u/cyrilbenson47. This is almost the same what Charlie Lee of Litecoin tweeted about a year ago: “If you can’t stomach a 90 percent drop in crypto, don’t adopt early.” Those that dropped out, being unable to stomach the losses, shared their stories as well: they mostly invested more than they could afford to lose - something that is incredibly easy to do - and the stress got the best of them. “You can’t put a price on stress levels and your mental health,” writes u/tksopinion. Through all the posts, the community is still trying to remain optimistic and give a little hope to those who are sick and tired of the bear run. How effective this approach will be remains to be seen. In the meantime, bitcoin and altcoins nosedive:",2018-08-14
" An Estonian crypto enthusiast and investor identified as German Neff has launched a new campaign aimed at finally finding out who Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, really is.  With the hashtag #findsatoshi, Neff has now taken to the popular Russian crowdfunding website Boomstarter where he is hoping to raise nearly a quarter of a million US dollars to help in the search of the Bitcoin creator. Although people have been searching for Satoshi’s true identity for years without getting any closer to the truth, Neff insists on finding him: “Satoshi needs to be found […] Was it really an enthusiast who gave the world an independent currency or was it a group of people pursuing scientific or purely selfish purposes? Or perhaps Bitcoin is an invention of a large company or an IT giant that decided to take a new direction? Can Bitcoin be the state invention, created with the purpose to control all transactions? There are many assumptions as to who might be behind this, but neither theory has been confirmed.” Neff claims he has been collecting information about Satoshi over the past three years. Having already raised USD 100,000, Neff’s target of a quarter million dollars could be within reach. Driven by his admirable determination, Mr. Neff plans on spending the money to hire private detectives from places like Japan, New York, London, and Russia in one of the biggest search efforts to date for the bitcoin creator. “We, the crypto-enthusiasts, are obliged to find out the truth in order to exist peacefully in this environment. Without the fear that tomorrow a man will come out from behind the curtains announcing that the circus is over and then will disappear again […] We have the right to know the identity of Satoshi,” Mr. Neff and his group wrote on the crowdfunding website.

" With the Turkish lira extending its decline on Monday after falling more than 20% against the US dollar last week, more and more Turkish citizens are reportedly looking to bitcoin as a way to protect themselves against the falling currency. The most recent declines for the Turkish lira came as a result of a trade dispute with US President Donald Trump, who on Friday announced via Twitter that he had “authorized a doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum with respect to Turkey.”  As the two governments battle it out over sanctions and trade tariffs, ordinary citizens, however, are forced to look for ways to preserve whatever money they may have saved up.  A Reddit user, supposedly from Turkey wrote that awareness about bitcoin is now spreading quickly in Turkey, and that online discussion forums that used to deal with dollar exchange rates are now increasingly used to spread bitcoin charts and investment ideas. However, the same user added that Turkish people still need to get more educated on the issue, and suggested that social media campaigns aimed at increasing knowledge about bitcoin in the country could be very effective. Volume surges on Turkish exchanges According to data from Coinmarketcap.com, Turkish bitcoin exchange BTCTurk has seen an increase in trading volume of 110% over the past seven days, while local competitor Paribu is up by roughly 125% over the same time period. Peer-to-peer trading data also shows increased interest in bitcoin: Measured in Turkish Lira, bitcoin has gained roughly 65% since it bottomed in late June, with the sharpest increases seen over the past few days, according to price data from Bitfinex. And with the lira continuing to spiral downwards, the trend of more Turkish currency being converted into bitcoin is likely to continue. Meanwhile, the South African rand touched a two-year low amidst widespread worries in the market that the situation in Turkey could spill over to other emerging market currencies. The South African rand has long been under heavy pressure, and various media outlets have for months reported that the uncertain situation in the country has benefitted bitcoin, despite the government’s skepticism. Back in Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan over the weekend optimistically asked citizens of his country to convert US dollars and gold into Turkish lira as soon as possible to help the deteriorating situation for the country’s currency.  “Change the euros, the dollars and the gold that you are keeping beneath your pillows into lira at our banks. This is a domestic and national struggle,” Erdogan said, while referring to the US tariffs as an “economic war.”  However, other than telling citizens that the US have “their dollars” and we have “our god,” Erdogan offered little assurance to people who are wondering why they should choose to hold a currency that has depreciated by roughly 45% against the US dollar since the start of the year. Luckily for many people in Turkey, Turkish banks still accept dealings with bitcoin exchanges, meaning cryptocurrency can be bought for local currency on online exchanges. This differs from the situation in Iran, China, and other countries where cryptocurrency trading can happen through peer-to-peer marketplaces such as Localbitcoins.com due to government restrictions. As reported by Cryptonews.com, while cryptocurrencies may look like a refuge for people in struggling economies, there's still no concrete evidence of just how safe they'll be over the long term.",2018-08-13
" Adoption hasn’t kept up with the price growth of major cryptocurrencies, according to Chris Burniske, author and partner at the crypto-focused venture capital firm Placeholder. In a series of eight tweets on Sunday,  he explained his thoughts on the current bear market in crypto. 1/ Why is #crypto falling so much in 2018? Because in 2017 the market was up > 30x, but adoption (beyond investing & trading) wasn’t concurrently up 30x. Burniske, who became somewhat of a pioneer on the topic of cryptoasset valuation with his 2017 book Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond, further said that the market right now is about “10x above January 2017 prices,” while asking if adoption has also grown 10x since then. “On the bright side,” he wrote, crypto will eventually consolidate and we will enter “a new J-curve era.” 4/ On the bright side, as we eventually consolidate #crypto will be entering a new J-curve era 🙂 https://t.co/L4BLHBnC0U Burniske is not alone stressing the importance of adoption. Recently, Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of the Ethereum platform, said that “there's too much emphasis on BTC/ETH/whatever ETFs, and not enough emphasis on making it easier for people to buy $5 to $100 in cryptocurrency via cards at corner stores. The former is better for pumping price, but the latter is much better for actual adoption.” Adoption is a hot topic in the crypto universe. Recent market research has shown that the vast majority of people have no intention of using their cryptocurrency. Instead, they just want to hodl and wait until the prices go up so that they may buy more fiat later on. Meanwhile, Burniske ended his thread by asking what the best fundamental indicators for crypto prices would be, Twitter users responded with suggestions such as “Net capital inflows, GitHub [activity], and political instability,” while others offered “Google search volume” and cryptocurrency integration with merchants as useful metrics. Lastly, one creative Twitter user proposed “usage data of anti-depressants by crypto hodlers” as the most reliable metric to look at in order to understand crypto price movements. In his work on cryptoasset valuation, Chris Burniske has argued that merely looking at market cap can be misleading when it comes to cryptoassets, and that “network value-to-transactions ratio” is the best metric we have for valuing cryptoassets.

" Tuesday’s delay of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision regarding the VanEck bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF) is not the central issue that the market should focus on, although it was a frustrating event for investors, Matthew Newton, market analyst at social trading platform eToro, stressed. In an emailed statement to Cryptonews.com, Newton said that “the lingering question mark for the SEC is around bitcoin custody,” adding that “to approve the decision, they’d need to do so in the knowledge that the ETF was backed by physical bitcoin – either stored by the CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange) or a third party.” He further said that the financial institutions now moving into the crypto space will have to decide whether they want to develop their own storage and custody solutions, or if they instead want to work with players in the crypto space that are already offering such services. “We could even start to see consolidation in the market with heavyweight finance houses acquiring crypto companies. Goldman Sachs has already begun deliberations over custody, so watch this space,” the market analyst said, referring to a recent report from Bloomberg that the veteran investment bank is looking into offering custody services for its clients. Also, according to Google Trends, public interest in the issue of bitcoin custody is growing again: Meanwhile, search interest for the term “bitcoin etf” reached its peak for the year in the last week of July: In either case, the search term “bitcoin etf” is much more popular than “bitcoin custody”: Ten Bitcoin ETFs Pending SEC Decision In addition to the filing by VanEck, made through CBOE, nine other bitcoin-based ETF applications are currently being reviewed by the SEC.  The SEC is required to make an initial decision on the applications within 45 days after they have been published in the US Federal Register. Given current rules, however, the regulator can push back its decisions several times, which means that we may not have a decision on VanEck’s ETF proposal until February next year. The next deadline for the SEC to decide on a bitcoin ETF is August 23, when it is set to decide the fate of a proposal from ProShares, a well-established provider of ETFs in the US. ProShares’ proposal includes two ETFs, one that would let investors bet on the bitcoin price going up, and another that would offer short exposure, meaning investors can profit when the bitcoin price goes down. However, rather than holding actual bitcoins, the ProShares ETF would be holding bitcoin futures contracts. Judging from the comments of eToro’s Matthew Newton and others, the other nine filings may have slim chances of getting an approval, given the fact that the VanEck ETF is the only one backed by physical bitcoins held in custody.  In Newton’s own words, “along with regulatory oversight, this question of custody will determine the next big move in the market.”",2018-08-10
" Cryptocurrencies may generate higher risk-adjusted returns than stocks and other assets traditionally thought of as “safer,” according to a new study from Yale University.   The study, named “Risks and Returns of Cryptocurrencies” was carried out on three major cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin, Ripple and Ethereum – by calculating the Sharpe ratio, a measure for the performance of an asset adjusted for risk and volatility. The ratio provides a mathematical method to compare how different assets compensate the investor for the risk taken, making different assets more comparable. The price data examined for Bitcoin was the most comprehensive, spanning from 2011 to 2018. For Ripple and Ethereum, the price data began in 2012 and 2015, respectively. At the monthly frequency, the Sharpe ratios of bitcoin are similar to those of stocks for the comparable time period, although higher than the historical Sharpe ratios for stocks, the study found. Meanwhile, at the daily and weekly frequencies, the ratios are about 50% and 75% higher than those of stocks for the comparable time period.  The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better an asset is compensating an investor for the associated risk. The comparison of the Sharpe ratios
Stock* shows results for the whole sample between 1953/07 and 2018/04. Below are the Sharpe ratios for Ethereum and Ripple, as presented in the study: _______ _______ The two scholars behind the study, economist Aleh Tsyvinski and Ph.D. candidate Yukun Liu, further found that cryptocurrencies do not behave in a fashion similar to stocks, fiat currencies, or precious metals, and that it is therefore necessary to use other methods than those traditionally used to predict performance. Two trading strategies Two phenomena the researchers found to be useful in terms of predicting the performance of cryptocurrencies include the “momentum effect” and an effect they referred to as “investor attention.” Investor attention could essentially be thought of as the level of hype among people. For example, an abnormally high number of Google searches or tweets about positive things related to cryptocurrencies such as “buy bitcoin,” tends to generate higher returns in bitcoin. Likewise, high numbers of searches on things like “bitcoin hack” tends to lower returns for holders of that asset. Tsyvinski told CNBC in an interview that ""for weekly returns, the Google search proxy statistically significantly predicts 1-week and 2-week ahead returns."" The momentum effect is another phenomenon well-known in finance, which basically says that an asset that has gone up in price, tends to continue up, simply as a result of more and more investors jumping on the bandwagon.  To take advantage of the momentum effect in bitcoin, the two researchers developed a simple trading strategy that says a trader should buy bitcoin if its price increases more than 20% in the previous week, and sell seven days later. “This strategy generates outstanding returns and a very high Sharpe ratio,” the two were quoted by Yale University’s news portal as saying. Lastly, the pair claims to have debunked the myth that the cost of mining can predict cryptocurrency prices, as experts such as Tom Lee argues for. “We were surprised to see that it does not predict cryptocurrency returns,” the scholars said.",2018-08-09
" Canaan Creative, the world’s second largest maker of bitcoin mining machines, is bringing a new model to market that appears to beat the current competition from Bitmain’s Antminer S9. Canaan’s AvalonMiner A9 is reportedly capable of hashing rates of up to 30 TH/s, or more than double that of the current top model from Bitmain. In cryptocurrency mining, hash rate is the speed at which a mining machine can operate. A higher hash rate would allow a machine to get more mining rewards over a given period of time. The new bitcoin miner was announced at a Canaan press conference on Wednesday and later confirmed on the company’s Chinese WeChat account.  However, Steven Mosher, global head of sales and marketing at Canaan, revealed the details of the new miner in a Facebook post earlier, and added that the new miner will start shipping in the 4th quarter of this year: Mosher did not immediately respond to a request for more details. Some attendees at the press conference also took to Twitter to share pictures from the event held in Hangzhou, China: #avalon press conference of 7nm #bitcoin miner, price remain undisclosed. pic.twitter.com/gI3KsYRj6t According to cryptocompare.com, a machine with the same specifications as Canaan’s AvalonMiner A9 would be capable of mining BTC 0.4628 per year, or USD 2,939 at current exchange rates. With the new machine, Canaan will take the lead from fellow Chinese rival Bitmain, which is set to hold an initial public offering (IPO) on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in September. Earlier, it has been reported that Canaan has also applied for an IPO in Hong Kong this year. It is speculated that the amount raised through these IPOs will be a good indicator in the general interest in the future of mining and thus cryptocurrency in general.  Just last week, Canaan announced that they are bringing a TV set that doubles as a bitcoin miner to market. However, with a hashing power of 2.8 TH/s, the new TV is still a far cry from the company’s new flagship bitcoin miner. According to cryptocompare.com, a TV set with those specifications can mine BTC 0.04319 per year (USD 273).",2018-08-09
" Malware tailored for bitcoin ATMs have been made available for sale on “the dark web” – the term used to describe underground websites selling various illegal goods and services, IT security firm Trend Micro claims. While regular ATMs have long been a target for criminals, fraud related to bitcoin ATMs have so far not become much of a thing. Now, according to the firm, it turns out that for about USD 25,000, criminals can purchase bitcoin ATM malware through online forums. The software reportedly allows a fraudster to receive bitcoins worth up to USD 6,750 each time it is used, by “exploiting a service vulnerability in the bitcoin ATM.” According to the seller, the malware ships with a card with a built-in chip and near field communication functionality (NFC) “ready-to-use,” and “does not require any physical access.” The same seller, which appears to be a well-respected member of an underground online forum, also offers various forms of malware for traditional bank ATMs, as well as forged documents on everything from taxes to credit reports.  The particular seller has reportedly received over 100 reviews from customers online, indicating that the expensive piece of malware has generated a substantial income for him, and that it is already being used in several locations around the world.  In conclusion, Trend Micro wrote that “as long as there is money to be made — and there is quite a bit of money in cryptocurrencies — cybercriminals will continue to devise tools and to expand to lucrative new markets.” At the press time, there were 3,522 Bitcoin ATM's around the world, according to coinatmradar.com data. 74% of them are in North America.

" The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision regarding a highly anticipated application for a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF) filed by investment firm VanEck through the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). The SEC wrote in its statement that they have so far received more than 1,300 comments from the public on the proposed rule change that would be necessary in order to list the ETF on an exchange. Tuesday’s notice from the SEC would give the regulator until September 30 to decide on whether it will approve or disapprove the proposed rule change. Although many market commentators and investors had already expressed that they expected the decision to be pushed back several times, the market reacted by sending the bitcoin price further down. Bitcoin overnight broke through a technical support found at the USD 6,700 level and is currently (UTC 4:40 AM)  trading at around USD 6,500. Some people, including economist and early bitcoin investor Tuur Demeester, urges caution and warns the market that a bitcoin ETF may not be approved in the US until next year.  Also, as reported, Jake Chervinsky, a US-based lawyer at Kobre & Kim, a law firm, suggested that due to rulemaking procedures the SEC can, and probably, will delay its decision on the VanEck bitcoin ETF until February 21, 2019. Meanwhile, Demeester wrote in an opinion piece that “any anticipation of approval by September will likely be met with disappointment,” while still pointing out that an “ETF approval, even if it's delayed, would be a huge deal because it makes the asset extremely accessible for the retail investor.” Also, the popular crypto youtuber The Crypto Lark shares his view on Bitcoin ETF: #bitcoin $btc ETF delayed, market crashes, #mytwosatoshis https://t.co/ozKoad10OK",2018-08-08
" Between 2013 and mid-2017, ransomware payments reached at least BTC 22,967.54, which at current prices is more than USD 160 million, a recent study of 35 ransomware families claims. However, the study assumes that ransomware authors cashed out immediately after receiving victims’ payments, which left them with “only” USD 12.8 million in their pockets. The study, titled “Ransomware in the Bitcoin Ecosystem”,  has been released by the researchers who are part of TITANIUM, an international project focused on crime and terrorism involving virtual currencies and underground market transactions. The analysis indicates there are ""clear inequalities in the market, which could be considered as a top-heavy market in which only a few players are responsible for most of the ransom payments."" Below are the Top 15 ransomware families by received payments.  The Locky ransomware accounts for more than 50% of the ransomware payments and the first three families account for 86% of the market while the other 32 families share the remaining 12%, the researchers concluded.  Also, the study adds that the incoming transactions of 12 ransomware families range from very low payments up to USD 2,000. Three ransomware families have higher payments on average: DMALockerv3, GlobeImposter and SamSam. In January 2016, DMALockerv3 was known to ask for ransom payments of 15 BTC (which was equivalent to USD 6491.25). The SamSam ransomware was also known to ask ransoms based on the number of machines infected and the ransom could go from 1.7 BTC (at the time USD 4,600) to decrypt a given machine up to 12 BTC (at the time USD 32,800) to decrypt all machines infected. “Famous ransomware campaigns are likely to be a short-term, one-time deal, in which a ransomware author makes money quickly and then stops, possibly due to various forms of security interventions,” the authors said. Longitudinal payment trend per ransomware family: ""With over 500 known ransomware families, it has become one of the dominant cybercrime threats for law enforcement, security professionals and the public,"" the study says. However, it concludes “that the total ransom amounts gathered through ransomware attacks are relatively low compared to the hype surrounding this issue."" The study is co-authored by Masarah Paquet-Clouston, a security researcher from Canada’s GoSecure Research, Benoît Dupont, a professor from the International Centre for Comparative Criminology of the Université de Montréal, and Bernhard Haslhofer, a Senior Scientist at the Digital Insight Lab at the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT).

" The number of people getting involved in cryptocurrency mining is skyrocketing in Russia. Per industry organization the Russian Association of Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain, the number of new companies created to mine Bitcoin and altcoins in the country has risen by 15% since the start of this year, with 75,000 organizations and 350,000 people in the country with population of 144 million now involved in the mining industry. However, profitability has nosedived in the same period. News outlet Segodnya quotes economist and bitcoin investor Tuur Demeester as stating that Russian mining profits may have decreased by a whopping 90% in the first half of 2018, due in no small part to increasing competition in the country. Yet declining profitability appears to be doing little to dampen the enthusiasm many Russians now have for cryptocurrency mining. RusCable reports that an energy provider in Vologda Oblast, in the north of the country, recently discovered a cryptocurrency mine operating in a 47sqm apartment in the city of Cherepovets. The provider, Vologdaenergo, says the apartment was uninhabited, but had been filled with mining hardware, using up some USD 360 worth of electricity a month. Electricity prices in the region are among the lowest in the world: 1 Kilowatt hour of electricity in Vologda Oblast typically costs between USD 0.03 and USD 0.06. As reported, not only in Russia bitcoin miners have seen their profitability plummet as of late, while some miners had to unload their coins to cover some of their losses. Also, with cryptocurrency mining consuming an ever-increasing amount of energy worldwide, some politicians are starting a push for higher electricity rates for miners, arguing that their activities offer “no utility for society.”",2018-08-07
" As one may find Bitcoin price forecasts for this year ranging from USD 22,000 to USD 60,000, Tuur Demeester, a popular economist and bitcoin-investor, warns that the number one digital currency may be headed for lower prices before the end of the year. However, China may help bitcoin, he adds. Despite many people having called a bottom in bitcoin prices at around the USD 5,700 level seen in June, Demeester argues that on-chain activity on the bitcoin network still does not support its current valuation.  Demeester, who first recommended bitcoin as an investment when it was at USD 5 in 2012, writes in the article that bitcoin miners have faced a decline in profitability of 90% over the course of 7 months. He goes on to explain that miners therefore are forced to sell off a large portion of their mining rewards just to cover their operating expenses. Bitcoin price chart: Next, Demeester predicts that we might have to wait until next year before a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund is approved in the US. Although he acknowledges that there has been a strong uptick in institutional interest for bitcoin this year, Demeester points out that most of that interest comes from trading firms and market makers. In other words, these are institutions that don’t necessarily hold bitcoin as an investment, but rather makes money off of the volatility or by making markets. “Institutions who are known to be long biased, such as mutual funds and pension funds are not ready to invest because they’re not yet comfortable with the available custody solutions,” Demeester argued in his article, shared with more than 170,000 of his followers on Twitter. Despite his no-so-positive outlook on price this year, Demeester also sees several positive developments that could trigger a price rally.  Among these is the possibility that we could see a new wave of Chinese capital flowing into bitcoin as a result of depreciation of the Chinese yuan this year. Due to capital controls in the country, bitcoin is an attractive option used by some people to move capital out of the country.",2018-08-06
" Market manipulation is still flourishing in the crypto world. The Wall Street Journal said it had identified 105 groups on chatting apps Telegram and Discord offering “trading signals,” a type of service that is often associated with pump-and-dumps. In total, the WSJ said that between January and the end of July it identified 175 “pump and dump” schemes involving 121 different digital coins, which show a sudden rise in price and an equally sudden fall minutes later. The report mentions coins such as version, cloakcoin, granitecoin, pesetacoin, stealth, and agrello.  Among the pump-and-dump groups examined by the newspaper, the biggest group – identified as “Big Pump Signal” - had more than 74,000 members in its Telegram channel. Since December, the group has reportedly initiated 26 pumps, totaling around USD 222 million in trading activity. For example, on July 1, after followers of Big Pump Signal were commanded to start buying a token called cloakcoin, the price jumped 50% to USD 5.77 on Binance, a major exchange, before dropping almost a dollar after two minutes, according to the report. In total, 6,700 trades worth USD 1.7 million were executed—compared with virtually no trading the hour before, it added, saying that one user claimed he made USD 1,400 on this pump without going “big”. Cloakcoin price chart: Many of the groups charge monthly fees of USD 50 to USD 250 or require members to evangelize the service for access to trading information, the WSJ said. Pump-and-dump schemes are among the oldest forms of fraud in financial markets and can happen either by traders talking up the price of a particular asset before they cash in on it, or by a group of traders getting together to buy an asset, driving up the price in the process. Once the price has reached the pumpers target, they rush to sell, leaving behind the unknowing traders who bought in. Although pump-and-dumps have long been outlawed in traditional financial markets, they still persist to some degree. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regularly goes after groups that profit from the activity, particularly in the very small so-called micro-cap stocks. In crypto, however, regulators have yet to bring up even a single case against the fraudsters behind these schemes. One problem faced by regulators is that it can be difficult to determine who has jurisdiction over the markets where the fraud takes place. As a largely unregulated market, crypto is traded without regard to national borders and by traders who sometimes stay anonymous, meaning it is an almost impossible task for regulators to take on. Essentially a zero-sum game, a pump-and-dump transfers money from those who jump on the bandwagon when they see the price of an asset gain momentum, to those who initiated the dump. In reality though, it is often only the initiator of the pump signal that is able to sell off the asset with a profit before it’s too late.  As reported, bitcoin price manipulation has already put trust in cryptocurrencies at risk. According to professor Neil Gandal and assistant professor Tyler Moore, exchanges should do more to mitigate this problem, for example by sharing information about the trading behavior of very large traders on their platforms. “The consequence of not taking steps in this direction is likely a loss of faith in cryptocurrencies,” the two scholars wrote in an article.",2018-08-06
" With cryptocurrency mining consuming an ever-increasing amount of energy worldwide, some politicians are starting a push for higher electricity rates for miners, arguing that their activities offer “no utility for society.” Crypto mining facilities in many countries in Europe and North America enjoy the same discounted electricity rates as other data centers and traditional energy-intensive industries pay. However, some politicians are trying to include this topic in their agenda. The most recent example comes from Norway. In a segment aired by Norwegian public broadcaster NRK on Thursday, a local crypto mining firm known as KryptoVault AS were attacked by Lars Haltbrekken, a left-wing member of parliament in Norway, referring to mining as “an enormous waste of resources that perhaps could have been used for something reasonable instead.” KryptoVault’s representative, former member of parliament Gjermund Hagesæter, defended their activity by pointing out that the alternative for them and other miners in the country would be to move the mining operations to other countries with more polluting energy sources such as coal. Countries with plentiful and cheap energy coming from renewable sources have seen a large influx of crypto miners as of late, with Canada, the northeastern US, and the Nordic countries being among the most popular locations. The sentiment expressed in the debate is not unique to Norway, but can be found in countries all around the world. In March, Plattsburgh, a small town in New York State, banned the launch of new bitcoin mining firms for 18 months and in May it received a permission to impose extremely high-density load tariffs on bitcoin miners. While China is already known for its policy against bitcoin mining, in Iceland, the finance minister has warned that cryptocurrency mining could severely damage its economy.  Also, back in June, Hydro-Quebec, Canada’s biggest electricity provider, said it had temporarily suspended new requests from crypto miners after demand had reached a point where their ability to supply power to the region could be affected. Meanwhile, politicians are playing the bitcoin mining card at times when mining profitability decreased together with bitcoin prices this year. As reported by Cryptonews.com earlier, bitcoin miners have seen their profitability plummet as of late, while some miners had to unload their coins to cover some of their losses.",2018-08-03
" Bitcoin extended its decline and broke a key support at USD 7,400 level. BTC/USD tested an important technical support near USD 7,250 - USD 7,275, which prevented more declines. The price is currently (UTC 08:50 AM) recovering towards the USD 7,480 and USD 7,550 resistance levels. Major altcoins like ethereum, EOS and bitcoin cash are under a lot of pressure and they recently declined to new monthly lows. Bitcoin price chart: Bitcoin
Bitcoin price remained in a bearish zone and traded below the USD 7,550 and USD 7,400 support levels. However, BTC/USD tested a significant support near USD 7,275, which is likely to act as a crucial turning point. If the price starts recovering, it must clear the USD 7,550 resistance to move back in a positive zone. 
On the other hand, if the price fails to recover and breaks the USD 7,250 - USD 7,275 support, it could decline towards USD 7,000. Ethereum
Ethereum price traded to a new weekly and monthly low below USD 400. ETH/USD found support near USD 396 and later recovered. It is currently trading above USD 405 with an immediate resistance at USD 415. Above this, the next hurdle is at USD 425.
On the downside, the USD 396 - USD 400 zone holds the key support, below which, the price may perhaps slide towards USD 375. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price fell sharply and broke the USD 740 and USD 720 supports. BCH/USD tested the USD 700 support and is currently down more than 5%. If it slides further, the next support awaits at USD 675. On the upside, resistances are at USD 720 and USD 740.
Ripple price held the ground and declines were limited in XRP/USD. The pair is currently consolidating above USD 0.42 and it seems like it could correct higher in the near term. Other Altcoins Market Today
Almost all altcoins declined and posted losses, including Wanchain, Waves, WTC, PIVX, NAS, PundiX, LRC, TenX, LOOM, VeChain and Verge. The worst performer was WAN, which declined more than 20%. Overall, bitcoin is trading near a crucial support and a potential turning point. As long as BTC/USD stays above the USD 7,250 - USD 7,275 support zone, it is likely to stage a decent comeback in the near term. However, altcoins like ethereum, litecoin, EOS and bitcoin cash are likely to struggle to recover in the coming sessions.",2018-08-03
" With Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy proceedings now put on hold in Tokyo, a civil rehabilitation case has begun in which creditors are attempting to get back whatever is left from the collapse of the infamous exchange. In a revised version of a document dubbed “Basic Policy for the Rehabilitation Plan,” Japanese lawyers representing creditors of the Mt. Gox collapse proposed that remaining assets held by Mt. Gox should be distributed exclusively to creditors, not shareholders. Further, the lawyers propose that creditors who had bitcoins deposited on the Mt. Gox exchange at the time of the collapse, should be reimbursed in bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH).  “We are of the opinion that most of the assets, including approximately BTC 166,000 (USD 1.2bn) and 168,000 of BCH (USD 120m) and other derivatives currently held by Mt. Gox, should be paid to creditors at the time of the first payment,” according to the document. The group argues that this is the best option in order to avoid negatively affecting bitcoin prices on the open market, which could be a real possibility if the enormous pile of bitcoins held by Mt. Gox’s trustee first needs to be converted to fiat currencies. The group added that cash Mt. Gox already holds following earlier selling of BTC and BCH should be paid out to creditors in cash without first exchanging it back into cryptocurrency. With regards to altcoins, defined in the document as “cryptocurrency except for BTC and BCH,” the lawyers point out that it is “unrealistic” to repay altcoins to bitcoin creditors due to the limited number of exchanges that deals with altcoins. The document therefore proposes that altcoins should be exchanged to cash before it is paid out to creditors. The group further urges the trustee holding Mt. Gox’s assets to proceed with caution when it comes to making transactions with altcoins and selling them on the open market, citing concerns related to security and the possibility that a sale could cause “a sudden fall in the price of altcoins.” Launched in 2010, Mt. Gox handled more than 70% of bitcoin transactions worldwide at its peak, before collapsing in a spectacular fashion in 2014, causing losses amounting to hundreds of millions of US dollars.",2018-08-03
" If bitcoin is to one day replace the US dollar’s money supply – that is the total of all paper bills, coins, checks, etc. in circulation – its price would have to rise to at least USD 213,000, according to a new letter to clients sent out by Swiss banking giant UBS, cited by various media outlets. Joni Teves, UBS strategist, wrote in the letter that bitcoin in her view “is still too unstable and limited to become a viable means of payment or a mainstream asset class,” while also saying that the efforts by developers to address technical limitations such as scalability and speed have been “insufficient.” According to Teves, bitcoin will need additional regulatory support, as well as various consumer safeguards in order to become a future form of payment and a “legitimate asset class.”  Also, Teves found that 70% of big bitcoin price moves were results of speculative ""momentum-driven"" interest. Bitcoin price chart: The report further pointed out that bitcoin today can only process a fraction of the transaction volume that traditional payment providers like Visa can do.  However, solutions such as the Lightning network are emerging that would solve this problem. In this case, transacting and settling would be done off-blockchain, so the fees are low and thanks to the implementation of smart contracts for security, the payments can be instant - no waiting time for block confirmation. Also, another important factor is its scalability, which is supposed to make it possible for millions to billions of transactions per second to take place across the network.  Teves did not, however, address other key characteristics of bitcoin such as it being a censorship-resistant store of value, open to everyone, and free from inflation and government interference. Also, when all 21 million bitcoins are mined by the year 2140, the actual amount available to trade or spend will be significantly lower. As research by Chainalysis, a digital forensics firm that studies the bitcoin blockchain, announced last November, showed, 2.78-3.79 million bitcoins were already lost.",2018-08-03
" Bitcoin mining rig manufacturer Canaan Creative has reportedly come up with a creative new way for ordinary people to mine bitcoins by using their TV sets. With a hashing power of 2.8 trillion hashes per second, the company is betting on increased retail demand for bitcoin mining rigs, the South China Morning Post reported. However, the new TV set, known under the name AvalonMiner Inside, is still a far cry from the company’s most powerful bitcoin mining machine in terms of computing power – the AvalonMiner 841 with 13 trillion hashes per second, that retails for USD 618. The report did not specify, when the 43-inch TV set is going to be available in the market and how much it would cost. According to cryptocompare.com, a machine with a hashing power of 2.8 trillion hashes per second could mine BTC 0.04319 (USD 331 at current prices) per year. However, the report did not specify power consumption numbers. Canaan’s TV set can reportedly be controlled by voice commands and is able to calculate bitcoin mining profitability in real time. The new product is the first in a planned new range of blockchain-related home appliances from Canaan, the newspaper wrote. Although it is certainly a creative idea, early reactions from the bitcoin community reveals some skepticism. Beijing-based bitcoin analyst Xiao Lei was quoted in the article as saying “it looks more like a hype. It will be more meaningful if these companies are able to embed the mining function into existing major TV brands.” Canaan Creative is the world’s second biggest maker of bitcoin mining rigs, following Bitmain Technologies. Both companies are headquartered in Beijing, China. The news comes after Canaan earlier this year filed an application to list the company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, where the hardware maker is aiming to raise up to USD 1 billion through an initial public offering (IPO). Canaan reported revenues of USD 205 million last year, an increase of an astonishing 27 times from the year before. The company sold nearly 300,000 mining machines last year, with the US and Sweden being among its biggest markets.  According to figures from the company’s IPO application, Canaan’s mining machines accounted for approximately 20% of bitcoin hashing power globally in 2017.",2018-08-02
" Bitcoin found a strong buying interest near the USD 7,450 - USD 7,500 zone and started an upward move. BTC/USD is currently correcting higher with a minor bullish angle. However, there are many resistances near the USD 7,750 and USD 7,800 levels, waiting to prevent gains. Overall, it seems like bitcoin bears are losing grip, but bulls are struggling to take control. On the other hand, major altcoins like ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash remained in the red zone.  Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is trading flat near the USD 7,650 level with an immediate resistance at USD 7,700. Above this, BTC/USD could test a significant resistance near the USD 7,800 level, which is likely to protect more upsides in the short term. Should bitcoin bulls succeed in clearing the USD 7,800 wall, the price may recover nicely above USD 8,000.
Conversely, if the price fails to move above USD 7,700 and USD 7,800, it may perhaps resume its slide back towards the USD 7,500 and USD 7,400 support levels. Ethereum
Ethereum price extended its slide towards the USD 400 level and traded close to USD 405. ETH/USD is currently consolidating gains above USD 410, but it remains at a risk of more declines.
On the upside, the price needs to clear the USD 430 and USD 440 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. The next resistances are at USD 450 and USD 455. Bitcoin cash and ripple
Bitcoin cash price held the yesterday’s low near USD 735 and it mostly traded in a range above the USD 750 level. BCH/USD may possibly recover in the short term if buyers gain traction above the USD 780 resistance level. Supports are at USD 750 and USD 740.
Ripple price is stable near the USD 0.44 level with range moves. XRP/USD attempted a close above USD 0.45, but it failed to retain gains. It seems like the price is preparing for another attempt to clear the USD 0.45 and USD 0.46 resistances. Other altcoins market today
A few altcoins recovered during the past few hours, including KickCoin, ChainLink, TenX, ETP, Dropil, EMC, Bitcoin Private, Populous and DCR. Out of these, KickCoin and ChainLink performed really well with 25% and 12% gains respectively. To sum up, bitcoin price is currently in a recovery mode above USD 7,600. However, BTC/USD is likely to face a strong selling interest near the USD 7,800 resistance (the previous support).",2018-08-02
" The internet delivers.  So here’s what happens. Paul Krugman is a big deal in the business world. He’s a Nobel Prize winner in Economics, Distinguished Professor of Economics at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and a columnist for The New York Times.
He’s also a crypto skeptic. In his latest column for the New York Times, he argues that cryptocurrency is at least 300 years behind the current, let’s call it traditional monetary system.  He says crypto is too expensive to create, transactions are frictive, costs of doing business are high. On the other hand, conventional money ‘generally does its job very well’, he argues.  “Transaction costs are low. The purchasing power of a dollar a year from now is highly predictable – orders of magnitude more predictable than that of a Bitcoin. Using a bank account means trusting a bank, but by and large banks justify that trust, far more so than the firms that hold cryptocurrency tokens.” He acknowledges, that he might be wrong and ends his article this way: ""If you want to argue that I’m wrong, please answer the question, what problem does cryptocurrency solve? Don’t just try to shout down the skeptics with a mixture of technobabble and libertarian derp."" The internet replied, in kind.  Truth be told, most of the answers revolved around discrediting Krugman, without really answering the question. Once again, people started pulling out his old predictions, like when he said that the internet’s effect on the economy by 2005 will be no greater than the fax machine’s. (Same argument was used in 2013, when Krugman wrote a piece called ""Bitcoin is Evil"". Later, he told Business Insider that ""the fact that people are throwing around my 98 quote actually shows that they don't get this point — that they're confusing technology with monetary economics."")   Others were straight-up savage, like this redditor who said: “That's a bullish sign, that guy is always wrong,” or one person on Twitter that stated “another old man yells at bitcoin.” But there were also more concrete answers. Some tried to keep it short and concise, for everyone to understand: “At the simplest level it solves irreversible value transfer at a distance without a middle man.” Others have stated that bitcoin can move hundreds of millions of dollars internationally, in under ten minutes, for less than a dollar in fees. “What are the comparable options with the traditional system?” they ask.  “Krugman claims fiat transaction cost are low. In reality the fiat payment systems cost us 2% of GDP, which is quite a huge amount in absolute terms. It makes the economy less efficient, payment cost are friction losses in an economy and eat up profits and revenue. 2% is about two thirds of annual growth rate, so current transaction cost are a real problem. Bitcoin can reduce that by at least one order of magnitude.”  CIO and Managing Partner of BlockTower Capital, a cryptocurrency investment firm, Ari Paul, answered the question on Twitter, saying: You wrote an article about being skeptical of the value of Bitcoin without even addressing its core value propositions: censorship resistance and judgement resistance.  These have trillions with a T demand as we can see by the size of the offshore banking system. While others suggested that someone has to tell Krugman about non-custodial wallets:  ""Using a bank account means trusting a bank, but by and large banks justify that trust, far more so than the firms that hold cryptocurrency tokens.""🤔 hmmm ... should someone tell him about non-custodial wallets? However, Krugman did not elaborate whether those replies answer his question.",2018-08-01
" After a week-long battle between bulls and bears about the next move for bitcoin prices, the bulls lost their grip on Tuesday, sending bitcoin down more than 5%. Early trading on Wednesday confirmed the move, shredding off another 2.5%, according to price data from Coinbase.  The most popular cryptocurrency has now broken out of the range it has been trading in since the latest price rally occurred on Tuesday last week. As of press time, bitcoin is trading around the USD 7,530 level on the same exchange.  Judging from technical analysis, the price is now close to the USD 7,350 - USD 7,450-area where it consolidated between July 18 and 22, which may provide crucial support for another leg up. The support area in the chart coincides with the 100-day moving average (blue line) - a widely followed trading indicator. Bitcoin prices have historically reacted in a strong way, both up and down, whenever this line is crossed. Also worth noting is that the popular Relative Strength Index (RSI) has now come down from “overbought” levels, as indicated by a reading above 70, to a “neutral” zone of about 50. With all the positive news of institutional interest in bitcoin that has come out recently, the next few days will be a crucial test of whether traders, just like the big players, believe that the bottom in bitcoin is already behind us.",2018-08-01
" Private investors in the U.S. are still not showing serious signs of interest in bitcoin, according to a new report. However, it's the smaller investors, those whose investments are below 100,000 USD, who know more about the most popular cryptocurrency and are the most intrigued by it. But this comes with a twist - despite they're intrigued, they won't be buying bitcoin soon.  The report, courtesy of Wells Fargo, an American bank, and Gallup, an American management consulting company, draws a correlation between these smaller investors and their age, saying younger males are more familiar with cryptocurrencies than seniors and women. The report also says that younger males are also those who can’t afford to invest much – this is a category with less than 100,000 USD in investments.  This second quarter report is entitled Wells Fargo/Gallup Investor and Retirement Optimism Index survey, and was conducted in May, among almost 2,000 U.S. adults with 10,000 USD or more invested in stocks, bonds or mutual funds, within or outside a retirement savings account. The report paints a picture of a digital asset that’s yet to make significant gains among investors of any kind. It says that just three percent of men and one percent of women own bitcoin. Three percent of those aged 18 to 49, and one percent of those aged 50 and above. Bitcoin is more present among the wealthier population, but even there it’s fairly slim: just three percent of those earning 90,000 USD or more have bitcoin. Among those with lower income, just one percent.  So, what’s holding bitcoin back? According to this report, the risk factor. Three in four investors (75%) consider bitcoin to be a ‘very risky’ investment, with another 23% saying it’s ‘somewhat risky’. Just two percent consider it ‘not too risky’, leaving none saying it’s not risky at all.  The report concludes that most U.S. investors prefer to play it safe with their investments, opting for security over growth. But the younger generation, intrigued by the technology, might drive it forward, faster.",2018-07-31
" During the past three sessions, there were mostly range moves in bitcoin below the USD 8,250 resistance area. There were a couple of swing moves, but dips in BTC/USD were well bid around the USD 7,800 and USD 8,000 support levels. On the other hand, most major altcoins like ethereum, ripple, litecoin and bitcoin cash traded with a minor bearish angle and declined between 3% - 8%. Going forward, bitcoin may continue to trade in a range before buyers make an attempt to break the USD 8,250 resistance. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price struggled on many occasions to break the USD 8,250 and USD 8,300 resistance levels. BTC/USD declined, but it remained supported on the downside. It seems like the price is trading in a broad range of USD 7,800- USD 8,250 (UTC 08:30 AM). 
Therefore, it will either break the USD 8,250 resistance to accelerate higher or it could decline below the USD 7,800 support to extend the current correction wave. Ethereum
Ethereum price is down more than 3% and it broke the USD 465 and USD 450 support levels. ETH/USD is currently under pressure and it seems like it may perhaps decline further towards the USD 435 support.
On the upside, the previous support at USD 460 is now a key resistance for a recovery. Above this, the most important resistance is near USD 475. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price is also down more than 3% and is currently struggling to hold the USD 800 support. BCH/USD may continue to decline towards the USD 780 support, below which, the next major support awaits at USD 750. On the upside, the USD 830 and USD 840 levels are crucial hurdles for buyers.
Ripple price extended declines and broke an important support at USD 0.450. XRP/USD is now at a risk of more losses towards the USD 0.420 level in the near term. Resistances are at USD 0.450, USD 0.460 and USD 0.475. Other Altcoins Market Today

" There are so many ways to raise awareness of cryptocurrency amongst the masses. You could let people buy stuff with crypto on the world's biggest online stores, or you could build a decentralized social network where people would be in control of their data and where they could get a small cut of the revenue from ads, in crypto. Or, you know, you could just shove a bitcoin into Kim Kardashian's hands and let her Instagram do the hard work.  That's basically what happened two days ago, during the First Annual City of Hope Charity Poker Tournament. Matthew Roszak, co-founder and chairman at blockchain technology company Bloq (among other things), gave Kim K a bitcoin to gamble with and obviously, she posted it on her Instagram story, while he took to Twitter.

Among Kim K's 114 million followers, we bet there is at least 13,500 people that weren't aware of the revolutionary technology that cryptocurrencies are. The move pushed Reddit (and the media, too!) into a frenzy. Crypto subreddits were flowing with creative juices, with one person commenting “This was the confirmation I was looking for that I’ve made a sound financial decision,” while others were more interested in seeing the results. “Kim Kardashian could be the catalyst to get this bull market going,” and “This is better than you think it is,” were some of the comments.  Kim may not build a super revolutionary blockchain-based product that’s going to turn the market on its head, but even by mentioning it on Instagram, she’s created plenty of buzz which is always good for the market. One of the Redditors has made, perhaps the most precise of all comments:

" This past week, we saw a solid upward move in bitcoin price above the USD 8,000 level. BTC/USD pair traded towards USD 8,500 before correcting lower. It corrected below USD 8,000, found support near USD 7,800, and recovered back above USD 8,100. It seems like bitcoin is preparing for the next rally above the USD 8,250 and USD 8,300 resistance levels. Similarly, major altcoins like ethereum, ripple, EOS and bitcoin cash are trading above key supports and are likely to move higher in the coming sessions. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently trading (UTC 09:00 AM) in a tiny range near the USD 8,150 level with an immediate resistance at USD 8,250. Above this, BTC/USD must clear the USD 8,300 and USD 8,320 resistance levels to set the pace for a fresh upward move towards USD 8,500 or higher in the near term.
On the downside, the USD 8,050 support is a key hurdle for sellers, below which, the last swing at USD 7,800 is likely to hold losses in bitcoin. Ethereum
Ethereum price is trading in a contracting range below USD 475 resistance. ETH/USD is facing critical resistances near the USD 475 and USD 485 levels, above which, the price may rally above USD 515.
On the downside, there is a significant support near USD 450 - USD 455. Should there be a break below USD 450, the price may perhaps move back towards the USD 425 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price is forming a solid support near the USD 800 level. BCH/USD is slowly moving higher and is currently trading above the USD 820 level. A break above the USD 840 resistance will most likely clear the path for more upsides towards the USD 880 and USD 900 levels. Weekly supports are at USD 800, USD 750 and USD 720.
Ripple price is consolidating above the USD 0.450 support. It seems like XRP/USD is forming a base for a large upward move above USD 0.475 in the near term. Resistances are at USD 0.475, USD 0.480 and USD 0.500. Other Altcoins Market Today

" Bitcoin is as a “technological experiment” that is “much less risky at USD 7,800 or wherever it is today, than it was when it was at USD 100,” Bill Miller, the founder and chief investment officer of investment firm Miller Value Partners, said in a recent interview on Bloomberg TV.  The veteran investor – who claims to have bought bitcoin at an average price of about USD 300 – added that “for each day that it doesn’t blow up or gets regulated out of existence, more money is gonna flow into the ecosystem.” Speaking of altcoins, Miller said that “there are 1,600 cryptocurrencies out there, and I would say most of them are probably worthless […] I think bitcoin has the greatest probability of being successful,” adding that he sees Ethereum as a close second runner in this race. The investor also said that the best way to think of bitcoin is as a “non-correlated asset most similar to gold…except that it’s much more easily transportable than gold […] and it can actually be used to buy things.” Miller further explained that if bitcoin were to become a third as valuable as gold, central banks would start looking at it as another asset to potentially hold in the same way they hold gold today, adding “that would open the market up extremely significantly.”

" One technical indicator is pointing to the beginning of a new prolonged rally in bitcoin prices, according to research by Bloomberg.  The Directional Movement Index (DMI) is a tool traders use to assess the direction and strength of price movements in financial assets, and it is currently showing the largest positive divergence since the explosive rally of December last year. The strong DMI reading indicates that the current rally is more significant than previous rallies we have seen this year, possibly leading to a reversal in the overall bearish trend for bitcoin. Meanwhile, hedge fund manager Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek Capital Management said in an interview with TheStreet.com that he expects another correction in bitcoin prices before the end of the year. However, he also maintained his own bullish USD 25,000 bitcoin price prediction for the end of 2018, and a whopping USD 500,000 for the end of 2024. Speaking of bitcoin, Yusko said “it will have a parabolic move and then a crash, then a parabolic move and a crash, and that's the way technology is adopted.” #Bitcoin is #JustGettingWarmedUp$25,000 end of 2018$75,000 end of 2020$200,000 end of 2022$500,000 end of 2024 https://t.co/3ZarEFIRxH Bitcoin was up roughly 45% from the lows of late June, but has now pulled back to a level about 35% higher than those lows. The rally has been fueled partly by speculation that a bitcoin-backed exchange traded fund (ETF) will be approved later this year in the US.",2018-07-27
" Crypto investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twins best-known for their conflict with Mark Zuckerberg during Facebook’s early years, for the second time had an application for a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF) rejected by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin dipped below the USD 8,000-mark on Thursday evening following the news, in what can best be described as a healthy pullback following the strong surge in prices on Monday and Tuesday. Bitcoin price chart: On Thursday, the proposal filed through BATS BZX Exchange to list the “Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust” was voted down 3 to 1 by the SEC. The rejection marks the second time the Winklevoss twins have had a proposal for a bitcoin-backed ETF disapproved by the SEC. In response to the regulator’s concerns from earlier, the twins this time argued that bitcoin markets in general, including their own Gemini Exchange, are “uniquely resistant to manipulation.” The SEC listed in its decision “protection of investors and the public interest,” as well as insufficient “means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices” as key reasons for its conclusion. However, the commission also noted that the disapproval is not based on an evaluation of whether bitcoin “has utility or value” as an investment or not. In a statement, commissioner Hester M. Peirce, who voted against the decision to block the ETF, said: “More institutional participation would ameliorate many of the Commission’s concerns with the bitcoin market that underlie its disapproval order,” she said, adding that the ruling “sends a strong signal that innovation is unwelcome in our markets.” Despite this week’s disapproval, the ETF application with perhaps the best odds of receiving an approval is still under consideration by the SEC. That proposal, filed by financial firm VanEck through the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) – one of two futures exchanges where bitcoin is traded – is “nearly certain” to receive an approval, according to an anonymous former SEC employee. However, the recent bitcoin rally may turn out to do more harm than good for the prospects of getting an ETF approved by the SEC this year, another report suggested. An ETF would allow the average Joe to buy and sell bitcoin without having to go through an exchange – something that, as everyone hopes, would significantly improve adoption.",2018-07-27
" Bitcoin price chart: Bitcoin faced heavy offers near the USD 8,500 level, resulting in a tiny bearish reaction. BTC/USD declined below the USD 8,400 support and is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) consolidating near the USD 8,250 support. Conversely, there was a decent upward move in a few altcoins like ethereum, stellar, IOTA, EOS and XRP. Going forward, if bitcoin price resumes it uptrend, it would be interesting to see whether altcoins decline or continue to recover. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price corrected lower and moved below the USD 8,400 and USD 8,250 support levels. However, BTC/USD found a decent support near USD 8,100 and it is currently trading flat near the USD 8,250 level.
On the upside, an initial resistance is near USD 8,350, above which, the price must clear the USD 8,400 and USD 8,500 resistances to gain bullish momentum. On the downside, supports are seen near USD 8,200 and USD 8,100. Ethereum
Ethereum price recovered further and broke the USD 475 resistance. ETH/USD is currently trading up by roughly 1.6% to USD 482. A break above the USD 485 and USD 490 levels could clear the path for a break above USD 500 in the near term.
On the downside, there are many supports, starting with USD 470. However, there is a key support and buy zone forming near the USD 465 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price extended its consolidation phase and remained confined in a range above the USD 850 support. BCH/USD must break the USD 870 resistance to accelerate gains towards the USD 900 level in the near term. Supports are at USD 840 and USD 820.
Ripple price is slowly moving higher and is currently trading above the USD 0.460 level. XRP/USD is facing a crucial resistance near the USD 0.470 level, above which, it could surpass USD 0.485. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, many altcoins moved into the green zone. A few cryptocurrencies performed really well, including stratis, stellar and holo, up by 14%, 9% and 8% respectively. Moreover, komodo, PPT, PIVX, MANA and dropil also posted gains more than 5%. Overall, bitcoin price is currently in a correction phase, which may perhaps help altcoins in the short term. However, once BTC/USD starts moving higher, altcoins could decline once again. On the flip side, if both bitcoin and altcoins move higher, buyers will most likely gain bullish momentum.",2018-07-26
" With bitcoin futures contracts traded on CME Group’s exchange set to expire on Friday July 27, some traders may be wondering what to expect from the event. The expiry date on a futures contract is the day when the contract is settled. In the traditional commodities markets, for instance the market for sugar, this means that the trader holding the futures contract on this day better get ready to take physical delivery of 112,000 pounds of sugar – the standard contract size in this market. Some other futures markets, including bitcoin, instead settles the contract in cash on the expiry date, leaving the holder of that contract to do whatever he wants with the cash he receives.  In the past, the underlying markets for bitcoin have seen strong volatility and often some degree of selling following futures contracts expiry dates. This is a phenomenon known from both the stock market and foreign currencies, as large players in the market act to adjust their risk and holdings following the expiry. While generally a positive for the adoption of bitcoin as a mainstream investment asset, futures contracts have opened up the possibility for large investors to easily short bitcoin, meaning that they can profit from bitcoin moving lower in price. This has led some to claim that the futures market is negatively affecting bitcoin prices. Despite this, it is a reality that all markets consist of both bull and bears, and both sides are needed for the market to reflect true prices and be a place where buyers and sellers can meet and easily transact with each other. Bitcoin futures sees increased interest According to CME Group, interest in bitcoin futures trading is soaring, with trading volume up 93% in the second quarter of this year. Given the fact that mostly financial institutions and very big traders are active in the futures market, this points to a strong increase in institutional interest in bitcoin over the past few months. Bitcoin futures average daily volume in Q2 grew 93% over previous quarter, while open interest surpassed 2,400 contracts, a 58% increase.

Bitcoin had then just plunged from close to USD 7,700 to USD 6,300 over the course of 4 days.  However, the market later recovered, witnessing a jump up from a low of USD 5,800 on June 28 to around USD 8,200 at the time of writing.",2018-07-26
" Bitcoin miners sold off more coins than they mined over the past 24 hours, thus converting part of their holdings to cash, according to blockchain analytics providers, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. Miners historically have held a significant portion of their earnings in bitcoin in anticipation of future appreciation. This time, however, some observers believe miners are preparing for yet another downturn in bitcoin prices.  While observers disagree about the reasons behind the selling, some point out that miners likely can’t afford not to sell, given the unprofitability many of them have seen in their business over the past few months. ”I’d expect that at these relatively low price levels, miners are selling off all of their new takings - they can’t afford not to,” Nic Carter, co-founder of Coinmetrics, an open source analytics provider in the crypto space, told Bloomberg. According to an estimate from Bloomberg, most bitcoin miners need prices of around USD 8,000 to break-even in their business. Bitcoin broke through that level on Tuesday, after having traded in unprofitable territory since May. Bitcoin price chart: ____

" At the time of writing, the price of bitcoin sits at USD 8,254.49. That represents roughly a 42% jump, compared to some USD 5,800 where it sat a month ago. If you had bought bitcoin for 100 USD on June 25, 2018, that money would now be worth approximately 142 USD. Is it time to start kicking yourself because you didn't buy the dip? Nobody knows, this might as well be one of the final spasms before bitcoin kicks the bucket. Or, it might be the return to December glory, USD 20,000 and beyond. Whatever the case may be, it didn't take long for the media, and the crypto community, to take notice of the surge and act accordingly. The media are 'bullish', and pretty much everyone and their cats reported on the price jump.

Meanwhile, BitMEX, a major crypto exchange, claims it has broken the industry record for bitcoin trading volume, with more than 1 million bitcoin traded on the platform in 24 hours for the period closing July 24, 2018. Also, bitcoin's dominance is growing, too: Percentage of total market capitalization (dominance): We can speculate all day as to what prompted this surge in price, but it's probably a little bit of everything. For example, Bitcoin ETF is making rounds in the media. While news from Facebook and Google are not likely to move the market, it still might help investor sentiment.   Meanwhile, Matthew Newton, analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, suggested on Tuesday that ""if bitcoin can close above USD 8,000 today, we could assume that we may have a good run toward USD 10,000.”  It's Wednesday and bitcoin is still above USD 8,000. “The short squeeze on the market that occurred after the pattern completed, caused some concern that we were seeing a repeat of what happened in April, when bitcoin failed to break USD 10,000.

It traded near USD 8,490 and is currently correcting lower. More importantly, there was an upward move in most major altcoins like ethereum, ripple, BCH, litecoin, IOTA and EOS. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price remained in a bullish trend and broke the USD 8,400 barrier. BTC/USD is currently correcting lower (UTC 08:30 AM), but dips remain well supported on the downside. An initial support is at USD 8,250, below which, the price could test the USD 8,100 level.
On the upside, it won’t be easy for buyers to surpass the USD 8,480 - USD 8,500 resistance area. Above this, the price will most likely start a fresh rally toward the USD 9,000 level. Ethereum
Ethereum price finally gained buyers and recovered above the USD 475 resistance. ETH/USD traded above the USD 485 level before retreating to USD 475. 
The pair is showing a few positive signs, but it must gain strength to retain upsides above the USD 480 and USD 500 resistance levels. Supports on the downside are at USD 470 and USD 460. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price extended gains above the USD 850 level. It traded towards the USD 875 level before retreating back to USD 850. An initial support on the downside is at USD 840, followed by USD 830. On the upside, a break above the USD 860 level could push the price towards USD 880 and USD 900.
Ripple price is showing a few signs of life above the USD 0.450 level. However, XRP/USD seems to be struggling to move past the USD 0.470 resistance, which is a major barrier for more gains. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins rallied recently like IOST, pundi x, zencash, polymath, ardor, ELF, LOOM and binance coin. Out of these, IOST and pundi x gained 34% and 20% respectively. To sum up, upsides in bitcoin were impressive, but technical indicators are signaling a short-term downward correction. However, dips remain attractive to buyers near the USD 8,250 and USD 8,100 levels.

" The recent bitcoin rally may turn out to do more harm than good for the prospects of getting a bitcoin-backed exchange traded fund (ETF) approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this year, a new report suggested. With the bitcoin market soaring again, some worry that the SEC will be hesitant to add fuel to the fire. “The SEC doesn’t want any part of adding to or influencing some speculative bubble,” said Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. He claims he’s now  “10 times more pessimistic” about a fund being approved.  In a letter from the SEC in January, valuation and volatility were cited as key concerns for the regulator regarding a bitcoin ETF. That letter, however, was written in the aftermath of the explosive growth that brought bitcoin to levels close to USD 20,000, a far cry from the situation in the market today. As reported by Cryptonews.com, in the letter, written by the SEC’s director Dalia Blass, the commission remained concerned over the funds which offer cryptocurrency related products rather than cryptocurrencies, where the risk of volatility would increase from the influence of underlying markets. A few other points mentioned in the letter:  The ETF application that bitcoin investors are most optimistic about was filed in June by New York-based VanEck through the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) – a company that certainly has a name for itself as being a heavyweight in the world of finance. However, Jake Chervinsky, a US-based lawyer at Kobre & Kim, a law firm, suggested that due to rulemaking procedures the SEC can, and probably will, delay its decision on the VanEck/SolidX commodity-backed bitcoin ETF until February 21, 2019. 0/ It kills me to tweet about SEC rulemaking procedures, but given the confusion on #crypto twitter today, it feels necessary.TL;DR -- the SEC can, and probably will, delay its decision on the VanEck/SolidX commodity-backed #bitcoin ETF until ~February 21, 2019.Thread. Bitcoin is currently up more than 40% since the lows in late June, partly driven by speculation that a bitcoin ETF would get approved in the US this year. An ETF is seen as an important step on the way to facilitate the mainstream adoption of bitcoin as an investment asset, much in the same way as futures contracts helped legitimize bitcoin as a trading asset last year. Meanwhile, the cryptoverse is growing restless, trying to persuade the SEC to approve a bitcoin ETF.",2018-07-25
" Everyone who is even remotely interested in cryptocurrencies, has its gaze fixed on the SEC (The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) in these past couple of days. For those of you who have been living under a rock lately, the date when the SEC gives its opinion on the proposed bitcoin ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is drawing closer.  An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, would allow the average Joe to buy and sell bitcoin without having to go through an exchange – something that, as everyone hopes, would significantly improve adoption.  The decision is estimated in the coming months, and it has prompted huge amounts of media attention and waves of internet memes. Google trends are showing that the general public's overall interest in the ETF has exploded, reaching highs it hasn't seen since late 2017. In the past, the SEC has turned down several ETF proposals. The cryptoverse hope that this time (a new proposal filed through the Chicago Board of Exchange (CBOE) by New York-based VanEck and blockchain platform SolidX) things might be different. The bitcoin ETF is ""nearly certain"" later this year, the ICO Journal reported, citing two undisclosed sources. One source is from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, while the second source is a former SEC employee who left the regulator two weeks ago. ""In January we were justifiably concerned about a bubble and the harm a quickly approved product could attract speculators and create losses that led to significant lawsuits. Now, those factors seem to be mitigated significantly,” according to the first source. While the second source expects a positive outcome in September, ""or if it gets strung out a little further it is simply a few ‘dotted i’s and crossed t’s’ are being finalized on larger regulatory language in the crypto space."" However, Bloomberg, for example, reports that we have bigger chances to land on Jupiter, than to see a bitcoin ETF launch in the US this year. According to the report, the SEC is tentative and slow, and it's just a matter of time before Canada steps in and scoops the pool. Bloomberg says the SEC asked the industry to withdraw original ETF requests, and sent out a letter to the fund industry, containing 31 questions about liquidity, valuation and security. It wants to have these answered before any new requests are filed.  ""Leveraged Bitcoin ETFs would almost certainly be the most volatile ETFs on the market and likely approved only after non-leveraged ones,"" it writes. ""Inverse ETFs would allow for the shorting of Bitcoin, without the risk of losing more than 100% of the investment."" At the same tame, the cryptoverse is growing restless.  This summer, the SEC asked the community for their comments about the Bitcoin ETF and it has received hundreds of replies.  A few examples below: Also, internet memes are mushrooming. While some are posting pictures of John F. Kennedy, clearly hinting at the moon, others are posting gifs of bitcoin killing altcoins, hinting at the recent price surge that does not seem to have affected the altcoins.

" “Has Bitcoin bottomed yet?” seems to be a favorite question of those frantically trying to predict the price of the most popular cryptocurrency - perhaps all of us. It seems like no expert agrees - some say it has bottomed, others say it hasn’t, while there’s always that group that says Bitcoin has no intrinsic value at all, so the point is moot. As reported, Barry Silbert, CEO of Digital Currency Group, a venture capital company focusing on the digital currency market, says the market has bottomed out when it comes to Bitcoin.  When asked what caused the bottom to come in now, Silbert replied by saying “I think the bears just kind of ran out of energy, ran out of Bitcoin to sell, and I think that from a technical perspective it’s starting to look pretty good,” adding that “when the Chair of the Fed [The Federal Reserve System, the central banking system of the USA] says negative things about Bitcoin […] and Bitcoin doesn’t move, I think that’s a really bullish sign.” Meanwhile, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and co-CEO of Bitmex, a cryptocurrency exchange, and the Bitcoin bull who predicted the cryptocurrency would reach USD 50,000 by year’s end just a few weeks ago, said Bitcoin hasn’t bottomed yet. “I don't actually think we've seen the worst [...] I would like to see us test 5,000 to really see if we put a bottom in,” he told CNBC. Bitcoin price chart: In May, a popular crypto analyst, Willy Woo, estimated that there may possibly be a correction going into the July-September period, followed by an accumulation phase. Meanwhile, various experts recently forecasted that bitcoin might reach USD 25,000 - USD 60,000 by the end of this year. (Watch Tom Lee, co-founder and head of Fundstrat Global Advisors, commenting on the recent bitcoin's breakout here.) However, the forecast game of whether or not Bitcoin has finally hit rock bottom is a dangerous one. Around a month ago, experts on CNBC’s Fast Money believed that Bitcoin was bottoming out at USD 7,000. However, only a few days later, Bitcoin slumped below USD 7,000 and stayed there until a few days ago.",2018-07-20

" The world’s richest of the rich are often asked about their opinions on current matters, especially if it pertains to the financial sector. Their opinions on Bitcoin vary wildly, from contemptuous dismissal to bullishness akin to that of Tim Draper. This time, Ken Griffin, Marc Lasry and Howard Marks offer their view of the cryptocurrency. One of them even claims that he has invested 1% of his personal funds into Bitcoin. Ken Griffin, American investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist, is not a fan of Bitcoin, to say the least. He still scratches his head about it, he said at the Delivering Alpha Conference in New York on Wednesday, adding, according to CNBC, “I have a hard time finding myself wanting to be in the position of being a liquidity provider to a product that I don’t believe in.” He also said, “I don’t have a single portfolio manager [of mine] who has told me we should buy crypto, not a single portfolio manager.”  Interesting, because reports say that the investment banking giant Goldman Sachs, is looking to add cryptocurrency trading. At the same time, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, said on Monday that the world’s largest asset manager has put together a team to look at blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. However, Fink argues that he does not see massive investor demand. Howard Marks, another investor, spoke at the same conference. “It's not an investment [...] it's a trade,” he said. “In the long run, I think it will be shown not to have any substance.” People who buy Bitcoin, in his opinion, are only doing so because they hope someone will buy it from them at a higher price. When he was a kid, he said, they called it “the greater fool theory.”  This comment rings similar to what Bill Gates said about Bitcoin. Gates and his comments have been ridiculed in the space ever since. Meanwhile, Marc Lasry, hedge fund manager, disagrees with his colleagues. In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, he said that the price of Bitcoin could reach USD 40,000 as it goes more mainstream. As for why he prefers Bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies, he said, “The reason why I like Bitcoin is because it's the one everybody is going to come to.” Also, after buying his first bitcoin a few years ago he says that now he's invested around 1% of its personal funds in this cryptocurrency. However, when asked by the show host what the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is today, Lasry replied: ""I have no idea."" His comments hearken to those of Tim Draper, a famous early investor in groundbreaking projects such as the internet, Tesla, Skype and Hotmail among others. He famously said that Bitcoin will be “bigger than the internet, bigger than the Iron Age, the Renaissance” and that its price will reach USD 250,000 within four years. As to how he knows that, he joked that “spirits told me.” Who is going to be right is probably the question of the decade, as the world shifts to watch the young industry grow.

" Yesterday, we discussed a crucial hurdle for bitcoin buyers near the 100-day SMA at USD 7,600. BTC/USD tested the mentioned resistance and faced heavy sell offers. As a result, the price started a downward correction and declined below USD 7,500. However, the price remains well supported on the downside near USD 7,150 and USD 7,080. Similarly, there were bearish moves in altcoins like ethereum and ripple, but both are currently trading near important support levels. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price corrected lower and traded towards the USD 7,275 level. Losses were limited in BTC/USD and the pair started consolidating. The price is currently down roughly 1.4% (UTC 09:00) with an immediate support at USD 7,275. Below this, the price may perhaps test a key pivot support at USD 7,150.
On the upside, the price is facing a significant resistance near USD 7,550 and USD 7,600. A successful daily close above these resistances could further accelerate gains in bitcoin.  Ethereum
Ethereum price was under pressure and declined below the USD 500 support. ETH/USD is down around 5% and is currently trading above USD 470 support. Below this, the next key support awaits near USD 460.
On the upside, the USD 500 level is once again a major resistance, above which, the price is likely to resume its upward move toward the USD 515 and USD 525 levels. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price corrected lower, but it is holding a key support at USD 800. BCH/USD must stay above the USD 780 - USD 800 support zone to move back higher. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the USD 830 level, followed by the USD 850 level.
Ripple price trimmed most of its gains and declined below the USD 0.50 support. It is a bearish sign, but if the XRP/USD pair manages to hold the USD 0.48 support, it could recover once again. Other Altcoins Market Today
There were sharp declines in a few altcoins like aion, LOOM, DROP, POWR, WAX, WAN and ETHOS. However, there are still many bullish signs on the charts, suggesting that dips remain supported. Bitcoin price could correct further lower, but there are many key supports on the downside such as USD 7,150, USD 7,080, USD 7,000, and USD 6,850. Once the current correction is complete, BTC/USD may resume its uptrend.",2018-07-19
" In two separate sessions yesterday, the US House Committee on Agriculture and the Congressional Subcommittee on Monetary Policy held hearings on issues surrounding digital currencies and Blockchain technology. The Monetary Policy Subcommittee hearing was titled “The Future of Money: Digital Currency,” and discussed, among other things, whether it would be a good idea for central banks to introduce their own digital currencies. Speaking at the hearing, Alex Pollock, senior fellow at the libertarian-leaning think-tank R Street Institute, said that “to have a central bank digital currency is one of the worst financial ideas of recent times, but still it’s quite conceivable.” He explained his view by saying that digital currencies issued by a central bank would only increase the size and power of the central bank over ordinary citizens. Further, Pollock added that “I don’t think the fundamental nature of money will change – it will surely be a monopoly issuance by a central bank,” adding that “it might be a private currency backed by reliable assets.” Pollock finally concluded his statement by saying “I don’t think it will be a private fiat currency like Bitcoin.” Meanwhile, the hearing in the House Committee on Agriculture stood out as more technical and detailed than previous hearings, with experts describing Blockchain technology as a new type of digital infrastructure, or a new type of foundational technology, in the same way as the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) email protocol was. Amber Baldet, CEO of blockchain startup Clovyr, said at the hearing that the technology is still in its early state, arguing that the US should take the lead with a more “proactive approach to regulation,” much in the same way as the US did with the Internet.

" Bitcoin price started a solid bullish move from the USD 6,700 support area. BTC/USD surged and broke a couple of important resistances such as USD 6,850 and USD 7,000. It registered more than 10% gains and traded close to USD 7,550, with no obvious news spurring the price rise. Altcoins also followed bitcoin’s path and rallied sharply. Large cap coins like ADA, BCH, EOS, TRX, and XLM were among the top performers. The recent upward drift in bitcoin is a great sign and indicates that the market is back in the green zone. Fundamentally, there were many possible reasons for the current trend, including Coinbase’s move into the broker-dealer space.  A few other possible factors were - BlackRock exploring the crypto space, CFA Institute, a global association of investment professionals, adding cryptocurrencies and blockchain topics to its Level I and II curriculums, and fresh inflows of funds sparked buying interest in bitcoin and altcoins. Possibly, even Charlie Lee’s (Litecoin creator) tweet to own at least 1 Bitcoin before buying any altcoins sparked some buying interest.
(Watch Tom Lee, co-founder and head of Fundstrat Global Advisors, commenting on bitcoin's breakout here.) Meanwhile, market analysts say new money coming into the market could have created a short squeeze, forcing traders who bet against bitcoin to buy the digital currency to cover their losses. “Investors would be wise to remain cautious, as we saw a similar situation in April where some big short positions were squeezed causing the price to surge. That said, if bitcoin pushes past USD 8,000, it’ll indicate that the bull is back and prices could continue to climb further,” Matthew Newton, market analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, said. Technically, bitcoin price formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern recently, and broke the neckline resistance at USD 6,850 to start a significant upward move. At present (UTC 08:00 AM), BTC/USD is facing a tough resistance near the 100-day simple moving average at USD 7,600 level. A break above this is required for an upward acceleration towards the USD 8,000 resistance. If the price corrects lower from the current levels, an initial support awaits at USD 7,200. Below this, the previous resistances at USD 7,000 and USD 6,850 are likely to act as strong supports. Ethereum
Ethereum price finally broke the USD 500 resistance and traded towards the USD 415 level. ETH/USD is currently correcting lower towards the USD 490 and USD 480 support levels.
On the upside, a break above the USD 515 level could open the doors for a push towards the USD 525 level in the near term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price surged more than 7% and broke the USD 820 and USD 850 resistance levels. BCH/USD traded close to the USD 900 level and is currently down to USD 855. An immediate support is at USD 850, followed by USD 840.
Ripple price extended gains above an important resistance at USD 0.50. XRP/USD even broke the USD 0.52 resistance before retreating to USD 0.51. On the downside, the previous resistance at USD 0.50 may perhaps act as a support. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many altcoins rallied today, including ardor, ELF, STRAT, XLM, ADA, EOS and DOGE. Out of these, ardor and ELF were the best performers surging 40% and 20% respectively. To sum up, bitcoin’s recent surge is signaling a sharp increase in buying sentiment. It seems like bitcoin and altcoins are likely to remain in an uptrend in the coming days.",2018-07-18
" Charlie Lee, the creator of the Litecoin cryptocurrency, may have raised some eyebrows on Twitter on Tuesday as he told his followers to try to own at least 1 Bitcoin before buying any altcoins, saying “there isn’t even enough BTC to go around for EVERY millionaire to own one,” while adding “once you have 1 BTC, buy all the s**tcoins you want!” Coincidentally, Bitcoin recorded strong gains both Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, surging by as much as 12% in less than an hour on Tuesday and rising above USD 7,000, first time since beginning of June. The gain followed a boost in bitcoin trading volume across popular exchanges. (Watch Tom Lee, co-founder and head of Fundstrat Global Advisors, commenting on bitcoin's breakout here.) Lee reacted:  _____ However, because of his original tweet, Lee faced a backlash from proponents of his own cryptocurrency, with some accusing him of talking down Litecoin and asking if he is abandoning the coin he created. Lee, however, dismissed all concerns. I'm spending my full time on Litecoin. What do you do for Litecoin? Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million coins, while 4 million coins are reportedly lost forever. Litecoin’s supply is capped at 84 million coins. It currently ranks as the 6th most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap.com.  While it is true that Bitcoin has outperformed Litecoin since the beginning of this year, both coins tend to follow each other closely. The chart below shows the performance of Bitcoin (red line) vs. Litecoin (blue line) year-to-date, using price data from Coinbase.",2018-07-18
" Bitcoin price registered healthy gains and climbed above a few important resistance levels such as USD 6,600 and USD 6,700. BTC/USD is now placed in a solid uptrend and the current price action is signaling more gains in the near term. Altcoins also followed bitcoin and traded higher between 5-30%. Ethereum performed well and it seems like ETH/USD may perhaps trade towards USD 500 in the near term. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price started a major upward move this week and gained traction above the USD 6,500 pivot level. BTC/USD climbed more than 5% and traded towards the USD 6,750 level. The price is currently trading in a range with an immediate support at USD 6,680.
Below the USD 6,680 support, the price may well test the USD 6,600 support. On the upside, a break above the USD 6,750 high is likely to push the price towards the USD 6,850 resistance. Above this last, the price may possibly test the USD 7,000 level. Ethereum
Ethereum price followed bitcoin’s price action and surged above the USD 450 and USD 460 resistance levels. ETH/USD even broke the USD 475 resistance and tested the USD 480 level. 
The current price action indicates that ETH/USD could continue to move higher with supports at USD 465 and USD 460. On the upside, a break above the USD 480 level is likely to set the pace for a test of USD 500. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price performed really well and surged by more than 10% to climb above the USD 800 resistance. BCH/USD is now placed nicely in an uptrend above USD 750 and it may trade towards USD 850 in the coming days.
Ripple price finally broke a crucial resistance at USD 0.45, opening the doors for more gains. XRP/USD is currently trading above the USD 0.475 level with an immediate resistance at USD 0.48 and USD 0.49. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins registered gains during the past few hours, including tenx, POWR, LOOM, dogecoin, LRC, decred, WAX and enigma. Out of these, tenX posted 39% gains, and POWR broke the USD 0.35 resistance to climb 23%. Overall, bitcoin and altcoins gained significantly and if the current market sentiment remains intact, there could be more upsides. BTC/USD possibly will move above USD 6,800, ETH/USD is likely to test USD 500 and BCH may perhaps accelerate towards USD 850.",2018-07-17
" Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, said on Monday that the world’s largest asset manager has put together a team to look at blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, Reuters reported. However, Fink argues that he does not see massive investor demand. In an interview with Reuters, Fink said that the company is still exploring all options: “We are a big student of blockchain.” Meanwhile, in a separate interview, the CEO told Bloomberg ""I don’t believe any client has sought out crypto exposure"". Also, when asked if he feels the need to be prepared for the day when clients might want exposure, Fink said, ""at the moment, no."" In either case, markets reacted positively - Bitcoin’s price, which is up by 4% in the past 24 hours as of the time of writing, sitting at USD 6,630.96.  Reuters stressed that “any move to invest in cryptocurrencies or to use blockchain by BlackRock would mark a pivot for the company and a major institutional endorsement for the insurgent technology,” as the company managed USD 6.3 trillion in assets as of June 30. Fink has previously called Bitcoin “speculative,” claiming that it thrives because of its anonymity - or, more precisely, pseudonymity. During that particular interview with Reuters last November, he also noted Bitcoin’s association with money laundering. However, in February, Richard Turnill, Global Chief Investment Strategist for BlackRock, wrote in a report that cryptocurrencies has the potential to become more widely used in the future as the markets mature. As it often happens, Bitcoin’s rise in price has boosted up other cryptocurrencies as well: the top 10 coins by market cap are in the green, with single-digit increases in percentage. A bull run may still be far away, but the community hopes to catch a break from the current bearish market, at least.",2018-07-16
" It’s been almost ten years since the inception of Bitcoin, and explaining it to a layman still falls hard. Many explanations have surfaced in these years, yet perhaps none as compelling and different than the one that visualizes Bitcoin transactions as bus passengers. TxStreet.com is a website that translates real-time transaction data from the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash networks into cartoons of passengers looking something like South Park characters boarding a series of buses, complete with sound effects of running engines. It partly showcases the differences between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash - perhaps most obvious from the number of passengers, where Bitcoin vastly outnumbers Bitcoin Cash due to popularity.  Each of the characters waiting or boarding the buses is a payment moving from one account to another, and their size directly corresponds to the amount of money being sent. Walking speed reflects whether or not the sender has paid a system fee to speed the confirmation. Each bus is a block of transactions that departs whenever a block of transactions is confirmed by a network and added to the blockchain. The Bitcoin Cash bus station has 32 buses waiting, representing the 32 megabytes of transaction data that each Bitcoin Cash block has available. Bitcoin, meanwhile, only has two, representing two megabytes - but one is SegWit, a solution implemented to “squeeze” more passengers onto the bus as a solution to Bitcoin’s scalability issues. The building next to the Bitcoin bus station is Lightning House, representing the Lightning Network. The creator of the website, whose Twitter handle is @revofever, explained to Fortune:  The website was inspired in part by TxHighway.com, a similar visualizer explicitly aimed at promoting Bitcoin Cash. TxStreet’s creator, whose Twitter handle is @revofever, told Fortune that promotion was not the goal when creating the website, saying “I was motivated to show each blockchain as accurately and fairly as possible. If the truth promotes Bitcoin Cash, then it is what it is.”",2018-07-16
" This past week, we saw a bearish reaction in bitcoin below the USD 6,400 support. BTC/USD even broke the USD 6,250 support, but losses were contained well above the USD 6,000 level. Later, the price started trading in a tight range before starting an upward move. The current price action indicates that bitcoin opened the week with bullish signs and if it breaks the USD 6,500 resistance, there could be more gains. Altcoins like ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash also followed a positive path with a couple of breaks above key resistances.  Bitcoin
Bitcoin price made a nice upward move after trading towards USD 6,080. BTC/USD broke the USD 6,250 resistance and is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) trading in a positive zone. However, a major weekly resistance is near USD 6,500. 
A successful break above the USD 6,500 resistance may perhaps set the pace for a larger bullish move during the coming days. If the price fails to move above USD 6,500, there could be a fresh bearish reaction. Weekly supports are at USD 6,250 and USD 6,080. Ethereum
Ethereum registered solid gains during the past three sessions and trimmed most of its last week losses. More importantly, ETH/USD recently broke the USD 450 resistance, opening the doors for more gains.
The next key weekly resistances awaits near USD 460 and USD 475. Above this last, the price could test the USD 500 level. On the downside, supports are visible near USD 440 and USD 420. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price was successful in moving above the USD 700 resistance. BCH/USD is currently up more than 2.5% and it seems like it may well test the USD 740 resistance. Above the stated resistance, the price will most likely surge towards the next hurdles at USD 780 - USD 800.
Ripple price is moving higher, but it is yet to break the USD 0.45 resistance. Once XRP/USD surpasses the USD 0.45 resistance, it could clear the path for further upsides in the near term. Other Altcoins Market Today
The market sentiment improved during the past few sessions, sending many small cap altcoins in a positive zone. Today, a few altcoins like MOAC, tenx, kin, DGB, MCO and 0x posted more than 10% gains. Out of these MOAC surged 23% and tenx gained roughly 20% to break the USD 0.85 resistance. To sum up, bitcoin and altcoins opened the week with bullish moves. However, BTC/USD must break the USD 6,500 resistance to maintain the current positive sentiment. The next weekly resistances are USD 6,800 and USD 7,000.",2018-07-16
" Bitcoin price declined further below the USD 6,100 level, but losses were limited. BTC/USD bounced back and is currently trading above the USD 6,200 level. Ethereum dived below the USD 420 level, but later it jumped back above USD 430. Similarly, many altcoins recovered and are currently showing positive signs. Going forward, bitcoin could either extend gains above USD 6,300 or it may perhaps decline back towards USD 6,000. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price formed a new weekly low near the USD 6,070 level and recovered sharply. BTC/USD jumped back above the USD 6,180 and USD 6,200 resistances to trim most of its losses. 
However, bitcoin buyers are facing many challenges near the USD 6,300 level. It they fail to break the stated resistance, the price could drop again back below USD 6,200. A few key supports on the downside are at USD 6,150, USD 6,070 and USD 6,020. Ethereum
Ethereum price also followed bitcoin and declined to a new weekly low below USD 420. However, ETH/USD found a strong support above USD 415, resulting in a decent comeback.
The price is currently trading above the USD 430 level (UTC 06:00 AM), with an immediate resistance near USD 442. Above this, the price must clear the USD 450 resistance to move into a bullish zone. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price recovered sharply and it is currently fighting to settle above the USD 700 resistance. Should there be an hourly close above USD 700, BCH/USD may well gain traction to move above the USD 720 resistance. On the flip side, a failure might reverse gains and the price could drop back to USD 660.
Ripple price declined towards the USD 0.42 support where buyers emerged. XRP/USD is moving higher, but it must clear the USD 0.45 resistance to move towards the next hurdle near the USD 0.475 level. Other Altcoins Market Today
A few altcoins gained bullish momentum today, including bitcoin gold, dash, ontology, ZRX, VERI, THETA, MITH and STEEM. The best performer was VERI with more than 10% gains. The current price action is slightly positive, but it seems like bitcoin is trading near make-or-break levels. On the upside, a key resistance is at USD 6,300, above which, the price may trade to USD 6,500. On the downside, a break below USD 6,070 could accelerate losses in BTC and altcoins.",2018-07-13
" Bitcoin buyers fought to prevent a downside break below a key support at USD 6,250. However, sellers had the upper hand, resulting in a sharp decline below USD 6,250. Ethereum is also struggling to hold gains, but it is still above yesterday’s low. The current market sentiment indicates an increased bearish bias, and if bitcoin fails to stay above USD 6,000, there could be heavy losses during the coming sessions. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price failed to stay above the USD 6,250 and USD 6,200 support levels, which is a strong bearish sign. BTC/USD is currently (UTC 8:30 AM) trading above the USD 6,120 support, but it is facing heavy selling pressure.
If the price declines further below USD 6,120, there is a risk of a crucial break below USD 6,000. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 6,300, above which the price may revisit the USD 6,400 pivot level. Ethereum
Ethereum price struggled to move above the USD 445 resistance and is currently down around 1%. However, ETH/USD is still trading above yesterday’s low, which is a short-term positive sign.
Having said that, if the price fails to move above the USD 445 resistance, it could break the USD 425 support to trade towards USD 400 in the near term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price extended its slide and is currently trading near the USD 675 level. An initial support sits at USD 660, followed by USD 650. Below this last, BCH/USD may perhaps move towards the USD 620 level. On the upside, resistances are at USD 690, USD 700 and USD 720.
Ripple price is in a bearish zone below USD 0.45 and it seems like XRP/USD may even break the USD 0.43 level to test the USD 0.42 support. Resistances are sitting near USD 0.445 and USD 0.450. Other Altcoins Market Today
Almost all altcoins are trading in the red zone with losses between 3-12%. The worst performer so far is bitcoin diamond, trading below the USD 2.00 support. Other cryptocurrencies like XIN, VERI, MCO, pundi X, NAS and POWR posted declines more than 8%. Overall, bitcoin and altcoins are struggling to hold the ground.

" Bitcoin remains the best bet among cryptocurrencies because people are “functionally using it,” Bart Smith, head of digital assets at Susquehanna International Group, a global trading firm that are active in a wide range of markets, told CNBC. He compared bitcoin to ethereum and smaller tokens built on the Ethereum platform by explaining that technologies such as smart contracts and decentralized apps “are very difficult [to use] and aren’t coming any time soon.” “The use case for bitcoin is valid today, which is the currency of the Internet,” he said, adding that “it’s digital gold and it’s a cross-border money transfer which people use.” While discussing bitcoin’s relative resilience as other tokens have sold off heavily, Smith, dubbed “Wall Street’s crypto king” by the show host, also mentioned two important price levels to keep an eye on in the bitcoin market; USD 5,800 and USD 6,800.  (USD 6.362 at press time, according to coinmarketcap.com.) Bitcoin price chart: Smith explained that we are now back at the same price level as “before bitcoin became a financial instrument,” referring to the time before the futures market for bitcoin was launched late last year. “The price seems to be bouncing around [the two price levels], it kind of gets to USD 6,800 and then runs out of steam, and eventually it’s going to break out of that range,” adding that “I think that will be the indicator of new money coming in.” However, China’s Center for Information Industry Development, an organization affiliated with the Chinese central government, wouldn't agree with Smith. In its recent ranking of 30 cryptocurrencies bitcoin now is only 17th.

" Yesterday, we discussed that bitcoin must stay above the USD 6,500 support to recover. However, BTC/USD failed to hold the stated support and declined sharply. It dragged all major altcoins lower like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, EOS and litecoin. The market moved into a bearish zone and there is a risk of further declines if sellers remain in action. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price broke a few key supports during the recent decline, including USD 6,500 and USD 6,400. BTC/USD tested the next important support at USD 6,250 and it is currently trading in a range. 
If the price resumes its slide and breaks the USD 6,250 support, there could be a sharp downward move towards USD 6,000. On the flip side, if the price recovers from the current levels, the broken supports at USD 6,400 and USD 6,500 are likely to act as hurdles for further gains. Ethereum
Ethereum price was under a lot of bearish pressure as it dropped by more than 5% and cleared a crucial support at USD 450. ETH/USD traded towards the USD 425 level and is currently (UTC 08:20 AM) consolidating losses near USD 430.
If there is a downside break below USD 425, the price may perhaps test the USD 405 low. On the upside, resistances are sitting near USD 440, USD 450 and USD 455. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price settled below the USD 700 support, which is a bearish sign. BCH/USD may continue to move down towards the next support at USD 650. If there is an upward correction, the pair could face hurdles near USD 700 and USD 720.
Ripple price extended its decline in the bearish zone and broke the USD 0.45 support. It stayed above the USD 0.43 level, but there is a risk of another bearish reaction towards the USD 0.42 support in the near term. Other Altcoins Market Today

The market is clearly under a lot of bearish pressure, but if prices stay above these important supports, there could be a recovery in coming sessions. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price struggled to hold gains above the USD 6,700 support and declined around 2% to test the USD 6,500 support zone. BTC/USD stayed above the stated support and is currently consolidating losses near USD 6,600 (UTC 8:00 AM). It must move back above USD 6,700 to recover and retest USD 6,850.
On the flip side, if the price extends its decline and breaks the USD 6,500 support, it will most likely move back in a bearish zone. The next supports are at USD 6,400 and USD 6,250. Ethereum
Ethereum price dropped more than 5% and cleared the USD 470 and USD 460 supports. However, ETH/USD stayed above the USD 450 support, which is a positive sign.

" While heatwaves are making rounds throughout Europe, floods are wreaking havoc in parts of China. While cryptocurrency is not a physical commodity, it is still very much influenced by weather which reportedly managed to bring down the global Bitcoin hashrate, or computing power of the Bitcoin network, showing exactly how important Chinese miners are to the whole industry. Sichuan, a province in southwest China, has recently been hit by heavy floods, rendering thousands homeless and destroying thousands of hectares of crops. The Bitcoin mining farms of the region did not escape unharmed: although owners tried to salvage what they could, photos of abandoned mining rigs are circulating on media. Max Kortrakul, founder and chief executive of social trading platform Carboneum, told Financial Times, “the pictures of the flooding in Sichuan are alarming and give the impression that the Bitcoin hashrate must surely have taken a hit.”  This is not unimaginable, as Chinese miners make up about 50% to 70% of the world’s Bitcoin production. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that the Sichuan floods could affect up to 8%-10% percent of global Bitcoin mining activity. Aaron McDonald, co-founder and chief executive of Centrality, a marketplace of applications, says the hashrate dip is due to the floods, the European heatwave, as well as the dip in price, FT reported. Leo Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association in Hong Kong, says that the suggestion of a 30% drop in the hashrate is the result of the flooding comes down to guesswork. Some analysts even believe that the hashrate dip has got nothing to do with the Sichuan flooding, regardless of the size of the mining community. In the past, local governments around China were trying to “guide” bitcoin miners out of the industry, but the industry has proven to be resilient.",2018-07-09
" Tom Lee, co-founder and head of Fundstrat Global Advisors, explained his previous prediction regarding Bitcoin price, noting that “we still think Bitcoin can reach USD 25,000 by the end of the year or something like that.” As reported, when speaking at the Asia Blockchain Summit in Taiwan in July, Lee revised his year-end price prediction for bitcoin from USD 25,000 to USD 22,000.  On Thursday, he told CNBC that ""Bitcoin has historically traded at 2.5 times its mining costs. It's not out of the question that it could be over USD 20,000 by the end of the year at fair value."" Later he clarified his position, saying he ""may have misspoke a little bit"":   ""What I was trying to illustrate was that given where mining costs will be and applying the historical average of 2.5 times mining costs, that would imply fair value over USD 20,000, roughly USD 22,000.” Afterwards, he stressed that bitcoin still can reach USD 25,000 by the end of the year. Still, he maintains that worrying about a few thousand dollars in the current circumstances, as any return even approaching USD 20,000 would be around 200% percent higher than where Bitcoin is right now, which is USD 6,543.67 at the time of writing, according to data from coinmarketcap.com. Lee has previously several times determined that the price of Bitcoin should be at least double the cost of mining. He has earlier predicted that by the end of 2019, a single Bitcoin could be worth anywhere between USD 20,000 and USD 64,000, with an average of USD 36,000. However, his prediction of a bull run following the Consensus 2018 conference in May failed to materialize.",2018-07-06
" A post in the immensely popular subreddit r/cryptocurrency garnered a lot of attention, as a user posted pictures of the crypto artwork that they sell, saying that their sales jumped after they started accepting crypto. It wasn’t until early 2018 that Lynx Art, an online art shop, started accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment three months ago. Since then, their sales have jumped 427%, according to the owner’s Reddit comments. However, it does not provide any other financial details. Right now, they accept several cryptocurrencies, including Monero, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Nano. Frankreddit5, the Reddit user, who posted the success story, wrote in a comment, “I just wanted to take a moment to give a sincere thank you to this community. We began business in 2012 but did not begin accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment until early 2018.” He has not yet replied to our request for a comment. Lynx Art started by creating a single poster design which they published online back in 2012. The artwork went viral and, from there, Lynx began rapidly expanding, offering new designs and opening up new partnerships with both artists and marketplaces. You’re not just able to pay with crypto: there is a subcategory for crypto-related art. From NEO, over Qtum and Ark, to one called “FAILED PREDICTIONS OF TECHNOLOGY” and even a humorous Nocoiner metal panel, every crypto aficionado can find something to fit their needs. However, art is not the only thing you can buy with crypto. Classic Recreations is a company modifying and custom fabricating high-performance vehicles in Yukon, Oklahoma. They have announced that they will start accepting cryptocurrencies as a payment option for their custom built-to-order cars and officially licensed continuation vehicles, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Docademic.",2018-07-05
" During the past three sessions, there were mostly range moves in bitcoin and altcoins. BTC/USD corrected a few points recently, found support near USD 6,400, and bounced back. Similarly, there were decent bullish moves in altcoins like ethereum, bitcoin cash, ripple and litecoin. The current price action suggests more positive moves and possibilities of fresh monthly highs in bitcoin, ETH, LTC and XRP. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price found a strong buying interest above the USD 6,400 support. BTC/USD recovered nicely and is currently trading near the USD 6,600 level (GMT 08:30). On the upside, resistances are seen near USD 6,720 and USD 6,780. Above this last, the price will most likely break USD 6,800 for a new monthly high.
Should there be a downside correction, the USD 6,500 and USD 6,400 support levels are likely to stop declines. Below USD 6,400, the price may face an increased selling pressure in the short term. Ethereum
Ethereum price bounced back and is currently trading well above the USD 460 support. ETH/USD must clear the USD 480 resistance to make an attempt to surpass USD 500.
If there is a short term downward move, the price may perhaps test the USD 450 support, which is a strong barrier for sellers. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price is struggling to catch bids and is currently trading flat near the USD 760 level. On the upside, there are many resistances such as USD 780 and USD 800. Above this last, BCH/USD could move into a bullish zone. If not, there is a risk of an extended decline towards the USD 720 support in the near term.
Ripple price is finding it hard to move back above the USD 0.50 resistance. It is currently trading above the USD 0.48 support, but with a few negative signs. If there is a bearish break below USD 0.475, the price may well revisit the USD 0.450 level. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins registered decent gains, including ETHOS, ETN, GAS, MITH, SMART, ZRX, ZIL, SNT and KNC. Neo also performed very well during the past two days as the price successfully moved above the USD 40.00 resistance. Overall, the current market sentiment is neutral-to-bullish. If bitcoin price gains momentum above USD 6,700 and USD 6,800, there could be solid gains in BTC and altcoins.",2018-07-05
" After a decent bullish wave, bitcoin lost the momentum near the USD 6,700 level. BTC/USD started a downside correction and tested a major support near USD 6,400 - USD 6,450. However, declines were protected and the price is currently trading above the USD 6,500 level. Similarly, Ethereum corrected lower and tested a key support at USD 450 before recovering higher. Overall, the current wave can be considered as a part of a correction as long as bitcoin is above USD 6,400. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price formed a high near USD 6,685 and corrected lower. It broke the USD 6,500 support and tested a crucial support at USD 6,400. The BTC/USD pair found a strong buying interest and is currently trading above the USD 6,500 level (GMT 8:30 AM).
On the upside, a break above the USD 6,600 resistance could set the pace for a push towards the USD 6,700 level, above which the price may perhaps test the USD 6,800 resistance. On the downside, the USD 6,400 support holds the key, below which, the price will most likely test USD 6,250. Ethereum
Ethereum price also corrected lower and traded a few points below the USD 460 level. ETH/USD tested the USD 450 support zone, which stopped losses. The price is currently trading with a bullish angle above the USD 460 level.
On the upside, resistances are seen near USD 470 and USD 480. Above this last, the price could test the USD 500 resistance. On the downside, the USD 455 and USD 450 levels are important supports. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price declined by more than 5% and is currently trading well below the USD 800 pivot level. BCH/USD broke the USD 780 support and is currently trading near the USD 760 support. If the price declines further, it may well test the USD 740 support.
Ripple price failed to stay above the USD 0.50 support and declined towards the USD 0.48 level. XRP/USD is currently down around 4% and is facing a tough resistance near the USD 0.49 - USD 0.50 area. Other Altcoins Market Today
Most small cap altcoins corrected lower, but there were a few coins which posted gains like SYS, MANA, SNT and STEEM. Out of these, SYS was very volatile during the past few sessions. As reported, a single SYS was sold for 96 BTC on Binance. Syscoin’s (SYS) blockchain was compromised since more than one billion coins were mined in a single block, while its supply is 888 million. It forced the exchange to temporarily close operations to perform maintenance.  Binance completed their maintenance and it could help bitcoin and altcoins in moving back higher during the coming sessions.",2018-07-04
" A lack of regulatory clarity has put enormous pressure on the market this year, as the G20 countries, the EU, and financial regulators in the US have all sent mixed messages about future regulations to the market, according to Tom Lee, veteran bitcoin investor and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors.  He was speaking at the 2018 Asia Blockchain Summit in Taiwan. The same sentiment has also been echoed by other industry experts, with Ryan Rabaglia of Octagon Strategy, a digital asset brokerage, recently telling CNBC that if regulations are sorted out, more and more professional and institutional players will enter the market and likely drive up prices as a result. Bitcoin charts: Secondly, Lee pointed to the futures market for bitcoin as possibly having a detrimental effect on the ‘real’ market. While Lee did not offer any reasons for why this could be the case, it is well-known that the futures market is largely controlled by banks and very large traders.  As Cryptonews.com has reported on previously, this is not the first time Lee blames the futures market for bitcoin’s misery. However, as bitcoin futures contracts are settled in cash and no physical delivery of bitcoins takes place, no direct link exists between bitcoin futures contracts and real bitcoin.  In May, the San Francisco Federal Reserve also stressed that  bitcoin’s fall from almost USD 20,000 is directly tied to the launch of a futures market.  “The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence. It is consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the introduction of futures markets for an asset,” four researchers wrote in the bank's Economic Letter in May. Bitcoin price forecast revised lower While speaking at the summit, Lee also revised his year-end price prediction for bitcoin from USD 25,000 to USD 22,000. He further explained that he believes the price of bitcoin should be at least twice the cost of mining, under normal market conditions.  UPDATED: Later, Tom Lee explained this prediction in more detail, saying that Bitcoin still can hit USD 25,000 this year.  Today, mining bitcoin is not profitable for most people, and Lee estimates the current mining cost to be around USD 9,100 per bitcoin.  Also in May, Fundstrat estimated that by the end of 2019, average price of Bitcoin could reach USD 36,000, with a USD 20,000 - USD 64,000 range. This explosion in price could happen due to crypto mining, as Fundstrat predicts a growth of 350% in hash power (the processing power of the Bitcoin network) through 2019.  Lee previously predicted a bitcoin price surge following the Consensus 2018 conference in May, which failed to materialize.",2018-07-04
" When sending cryptocurrency, one of the main features is the fact that addresses are long and virtually impossible to remember. Naturally, very few people are willing to type the address in by hand, instead relying on copying it from one application to another - and this is exactly where the danger lies. This type of malware is called CryptoCurrency Clipboard Hijackers monitors, as its name implies, the Windows clipboard, which is the temporary memory where the copied data goes until it is replaced by another copied thing. If this malware detects a cryptocurrency address in the clipboard - where it will inevitably be if you copy-paste it - it swaps that address out for its own. This means that the coins will go to that address when it is pasted, unless you double check it (and that is something you should certainly do). According to BleepingComputer, a sample of this type of malware monitors over 2.3 million cryptocurrency addresses. It can be very hard to protect yourself from this type of malware as it shows no indication of running in the background. This is why you should always have an up to date antivirus installed and running, make periodical scans of your system, and double check the address you’re sending your coins to. As Cryptonews.com previously reported, cybersecurity expert Lotem Finkelsteen of the Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point Software Technologies warns that cryptocurrency-related attacks will surpass all others this year. Many other security experts have also warned that crypto-related attacks will only increase, as there will be “targeted attacks on companies for the purpose of installing miners” as well as threats from cryptocurrency-related ransomware.",2018-07-03
" In yesterday’s outlook, we discussed the importance of the USD 6,500 resistance in bitcoin price. During the past three sessions, there were heavy bullish moves, resulting in an upside push in BTC/USD above the USD 6,500 resistance. It opened the doors for more gains and helped altcoins such as ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin and others to gain bullish momentum. The cryptocurrency market is now trading in the green zone with a lot of positive signs. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price formed a solid support above USD 6,300 and jumped above the USD 6,500 and USD 6,600 resistance levels. BTC/USD is currently (GMT 08:30 AM) trading in a tiny range below the USD 6,800 resistance, and is preparing for the next move. 
An upside break above USD 6,800 could ignite more gains towards the USD 7,000 and USD 7,200 levels. On the flip side, if the price corrects lower, the previous resistances at USD 6,600 and USD 6,500 are likely to act as supports for buyers. Ethereum
Ethereum price gained traction and moved above a crucial resistance at USD 450. ETH/USD traded above the USD 480 level and is currently consolidating gains.
An initial support on the downside is at USD 472, below which the price may test the USD 460 support. On the upside, a break above the USD 485 level could give an opening to buyers to take the price above the USD 500 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price surged higher and cleared many hurdles such as USD 750, USD 780 and USD 800. BCH/USD is currently trading with a stable bias above the USD 800 level, with an immediate resistance at USD 820 and USD 850. 
Ripple price zoomed higher and cleared the USD 0.48 and USD 0.50 resistances. XRP/USD is now trading in a bullish zone above USD 0.50. On the upside, resistances are seen near the USD 0.520 and USD 0.535 levels. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins posted heavy gains today, including WAX, Bytecoin, Ethos, MONA, ELF, LOOM, ELA, SYS, Golem, KCS, CMT, MITH and BTS. A few other coins such as Neo, ADA, Ark and NEM posted gains between 15-20%. Overall, the market sentiment was really boosted during the past three sessions. Going forward, a break above USD 7,000 in bitcoin could further accelerate gains in BTC and altcoins in the near term.",2018-07-03
" There are still more than 3 million people holding bitcoin in China, despite the government’s ban on trading, a researcher at theInternational Monetary Institute at Renmin University in China has estimated. The researcher named Li Honghan made the statement during a summit held in Beijing on June 29 known as the New Financial Trends and Fin-Tech Summit 2018, according to Chinese news portal Chinatimes.net.cn. While Li did not reveal his data source, it is well-known that Chinese investors are still active in the cryptocurrency space, making use of advanced censorship-resistant technologies like decentralized exchanges and peer-to-peer marketplaces to bypass government regulation. As Cryptonews.com has reported on previously, bitcoin mining has also proved difficult for regulators to crack down on in China. It is estimated that more than 50% of global bitcoin mining capacity is located in China, with the remote provinces of Qinghai and Sichuan having a particularly high concentration of bitcoin miners. The large number of miners in China has previously led Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse to attack bitcoin by claiming that it is “controlled by China.” Bitcoin has seen a surge in price and trading volume over the past few days, adding nearly 14% since June 29, according to data from Coinbase.",2018-07-03
" On this past Friday, someone claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto published 21 pages of new material which they claim to an excerpt, straight out of a book about the origins of Bitcoin. The site where this was published details the “first excerpt to a literary work consisting of two parts” that claims to be “a short story if you will, with some of the most brought up questions and answers. I wanted the people and the facts to be known.” The website that the excerpt appeared on is called NakamotoFamilyFoundation.org and was anonymously purchased three days ago via Amazon’s domain registrar. Of course, the self-proclaimed Satoshi (or, as the community calls him, Faketoshi) Craig Wright immediately tweeted that the “new” Nakamoto writings were a fraud: “Nakamotofamilyfoundation cannot get the dates nor technical details correct.” In true Nakamoto style, it even includes a cryptogram, which purports to reveal names related to the title of the book. The answer seems to be honne and tatamae (or tatemae), which is a Japanese expression that describes “the contrast between a person’s true feelings and desires” and “the behavior and opinions one displays in public.” The excerpt is titled “duality” in a similar manner. The excerpt also indicates that Satoshi Nakamoto may have been, at some point at least, a group of people. “The truth is one that people will not come to expect,” Nakamoto says in the excerpt, continuing, “Because the truth is too special to give away, requires a long answer, which will be in the book.”  Strange parts of the text include one that seems to imply that there was more than one genesis block of Bitcoin, the starting point for the blockchain, as the author refers to it as the “first” genesis block. Is it real? Nobody knows for sure right now. People mentioned in the excerpt have been contacted by WIRED, and some either refuse to comment or say that nothing is verifiable proof. What remains, however, is the hope that we will find out soon enough, and maybe the mystery of the past decade will be solved. ______ A few passages from the excerpt:",2018-07-02
" Bitcoin started 2018 with a spike above the USD 17,000 level. However, the price faced heavy selling interest due to regulation and exchange hack issues. As a result, a fresh round of bearish wave was initiated and BTC/USD tumbled by more than USD 10,000. In February 2018, the price formed a low around USD 6,000 and later corrected above USD 10,000. The upside move was capped by USD 12,000 and the price resumed its downtrend. During the past few months, the price traded with a bearish bias below the USD 10,000 resistance level. On the positive, there was no substantial decline below the USD 6,000 support area. Recently, the price traded towards the USD 5,650 level, but jumped back above USD 6,000. Overall, it seems like the USD 5,500 - USD 6,000 zone is a crucial support. As long as the price is above the stated support zone, it could make an attempt to recover during the coming months. A few significant resistances on the way to USD 10,000 are at USD 6,500, USD 7,500, USD 8,000 and USD 9,200. Finally, a convincing break above USD 10,000 may perhaps start a solid upward wave towards USD 12,000 and USD 15,000. On the flip side, if bitcoin fails to stay above the USD 5,500 - USD 6,000 support zone, then there could be a lot of pressure on buyers. The next supports are at USD 5,000 and USD 4,200. Meanwhile, last week, Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, an insurance giant, told CNBC that bitcoin would be a buy if the price falls below USD 5,000. El-Erian sees bitcoin emerging as more of a tradeable commodity than a currency, but doesn't expect it will get all the way back to USD 20,000. Ethereum Price Outlook Ethereum followed bitcoin and fell from well above USD 1,350 in January 2018 to USD 370 in April 2018. Later, ETH/USD corrected above USD 500 and tested the USD 800 level where it faced a crucial resistance. It declined once again and is currently trading well below the USD 500 pivot level. However, the USD 400 support zone is holding declines in Ethereum and it may perhaps continue to act as a strong support. To start a decent recovery, ETH/USD must settle above the USD 500 pivot level. Above this, the next hurdles for buyers are at USD 650 and 800. The final barrier for a larger upward wave is at USD 1,000. On the other hand, a break below the USD 400 support could push the price toward the 2018 low near USD 370. Below this last, there is an open space up to USD 250. Bitcoin Cash, Ripple and Other Altcoins Market Bitcoin cash and ripple were under heavy selling pressure during the first half of 2018. BCH/USD declined from well above USD 2,500 to USD 650 which acted as a strong support. It is currently consolidating losses and is preparing for the next move. Resistances are at USD 800, USD 1,000 and USD 1,250.  Ripple peaked around USD 3.70 in January 2018 and declined more than USD 3.00. It traded close to the USD 0.40 level and is currently in a bearish zone. Resistances are seen near USD 0.65, 0.75, 0.80 and 1.00. Above this last, XRP/USD could recover towards the USD 1.50 level. To sum up, bitcoin and altcoins declined heavily during the first half of 2018. Prices are now stable and are following a consolidation pattern. Going forward, a successful break above key resistances in bitcoin could stage a decent comeback in the coming months. Key levels to watch out are USD 6,500, USD 7,500, USD 8,000 and USD 9,200 on the upside, and USD 6,000, USD 5,500 and USD 5,000 on the downside.",2018-07-02
" The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently seeking public feedback on a new proposal for an exchange traded fund (ETF) backed by bitcoin. The new bitcoin ETF proposal was brought up by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) as it seeks to list a fund known as “SolidX Bitcoin Shares,” issued by VanEck, an investment management firm, according to an official SEC statement. The new fund intends to be fully backed by holding real bitcoin, as opposed to holding only bitcoin derivatives or futures contracts, as some other funds do. This could mean that a new flow of money from more traditionally minded investors and institutions can now find its way into the bitcoin market, potentially setting the stage for a new price rally. In the past, the SEC has turned down several such proposals, arguing that they have no way of ensuring a sufficient level of transparency regarding trading activity and potential price manipulation in the underlying market for bitcoin.  The SEC has also argued that they would want to have a market for bitcoin futures contracts before approving an ETF. With both the CBOE and CME Group now offering this, it is speculated that it is only a matter of time before the SEC approves the first ETF backed by bitcoin that is trading on regulated US exchanges. The approval of a publicly-traded Bitcoin ETFs would be a big deal for Bitcoin as an asset class, as ETFs are traded on exchanges in the same way as stocks. Traditional ETFs, which is a security which tracks indices, a commodity or a basket of assets, have gained substantial popularity among both institutional and retail investors as they are generally liquid and easy to buy and sell.",2018-07-02
" 20% of the surveyed UK millennials, a group of the population aged between 21 and 35, would rather invest in Bitcoin than in real estate, the UK-based build-to-rent developer Get Living said in its report ""Millenial Living in 2018"". ""The rollercoaster ride in value for Bitcoin has excited many millennials, with one in five seeing it as an appealing investment proposition compared with relatively slow-moving property values,"" according to the report.  The survey was conducted online with more than 3,000 millennials, living across the United Kingdom from March 28th to April 4th 2018. Therefore, even after the profound correction this year Bitcoin holds more intrigue than the prospect of steady growth in house prices.   This translates into the Bitcoin-related results: 27% of male millennials would rather go with Bitcoin, whereas the percentage of female respondents agreeing was not given. Cryptocurrencies and real estate are not quite apart. Since the young industry has already made waves in almost every business sector, real estate is no exception. Real estate venture Propy, which trades properties in cryptocurrencies on a blockchain-powered platform, has listed an historicRenaissance-era Roman mansion on its database.  Meanwhile, a survey by a banking giant ING showed that interest in cryptocurrency is expected to more than double (although they don't know when), bringing the prices up as well, as reported.",2018-06-28
" Seeing any cryptocurrency establish any kind of positive trend comes like a lifeline in this bearish times. Bitcoin dominance rate reached a high of 2 months yesterday, to 42.74%, and stands at 42.50% as of the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap data. The Dominance Index is an indicator that tracks the percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization contributed by the leading cryptocurrency. So, a rising dominance rate might mean the demand for Bitcoin is greater than the demand for other innovations. Percentage of total market capitalization (dominance): For example, last year, Bitcoin’s dominance rate increased from 38% to 66.5% in six months, driving its value up from USD 1,760 to nearly USD 20,000. But it must be noted that it also tends to rise during risk aversion periods, when investors move out of high-risk alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin, and then possibly on to fiat currency. Possibly, it would seem that risk aversion is to blame for this dominance rate rising this time, given how much the prices have fallen. A lot of investors seem to prefer cash over any of the cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin included. However, if prices start to rise along with Bitcoin’s dominance rate, it may mean that the cryptocurrencies markets have bottomed out. But the rising of the Bitcoin dominance rate also means that we still have time until the Flippening. It is a possible future event when Ethereum overtakes Bitcoin to become the most valuable cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization. The community argues that, with the fact that Bitcoin’s strongest claim to glory is first to market dominance, the Flippening is only a matter of time.",2018-06-28
" Hotel and airline ticket booking giant Expedia has confirmed that they have removed the bitcoin payment option from their website, according to media reports. The service was deactivated on June 10, according to a spokesperson for the online booking platform. The spokesperson did not offer any further comments as to why the company chose to remove the option. Members of the crypto community immediately took to Reddit to voice their frustration, with some suggesting switching over to more crypto-friendly booking sites such as CheapAir, which has accepted bitcoin since 2013. Some also noted that many employees in the IT and blockchain industry receive their salaries in bitcoin, and that Expedia now risks losing business from this customer segment. “[…] Customer support said they stopped accepting it June 10… A lot of us in the tech industry get a portion of our salary in Bitcoin and it was really good to use Expedia for flights. I won’t be using them anymore,” a Reddit user wrote. Expedia first started accepting payments in bitcoin back in 2014 as part of a partnership with the Coinbase exchange. With the sudden suspension of the service, some now speculate that Expedia acted in response to Coinbase suspending its custodial service for businesses. Without a reliable custodial solution, merchants working with Coinbase may find difficulties in continuing to process payments in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, after the social media platform Reddit ditched bitcoin as a payment option in March due to transaction fees and an integration issue with Coinbase, the platform is considering to reintroduce cryptocurrency payments, Cheddar reported in May. .@Reddit, which hosts communities for every single cryptocurrency in the world, is hoping to bring back crypto payments to the platform, this time with Ethereum and Litecoin in addition to Bitcoin, according to CTO @KeyserSosa. pic.twitter.com/wkUniMvhex",2018-06-28
" The value of Bitcoin may be manipulated by public sentiment from social media, new research shows. A four-university team, led by professor Feng Mai of Stevens School of Business, found that not only do comments influence the price, but some commenters can even carry up to ten times the weight of others. Professor Feng Mai was working with University of Cincinnati, Dickinson College and Ivey Business School, collecting two years’ worth of posts from the Bitcointalk forum, as well as two months’ worth of data from Twitter.  “Any changes in Bitcoin's price are obviously going to affect the sentiment around it, so we needed to factor in those influences as well,” Mai was quoted as saying on the website of Stevens School of Business. The results of this research were recently published in the Journal of Management Information Systems, and show that “periods of increasingly positive social media commentary do in fact influence the rising price of Bitcoin significantly.” But the voice of those who do not regularly talk about Bitcoin, instead taking the time to comment infrequently, is what is actually moving the price. On the other hand, users who are very active did not move Bitcoin's price much at all. “This was a big finding, and it does seem to prove that people are trusting the silent majority much more, perhaps because they do not seem to have an agenda,” Mai said for the Stevens article, adding, “It's also true that, by following the infrequent posters' comments, you get a much more accurate prediction of Bitcoin's price over time, and this is useful for investors and potential investors to know.” The team hopes to investigate blockchain technology and its relationship with social media soon as well. Meanwhile, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has already urged customers to avoid buying tokens based on tips shared on social media. Moreover, anyone who promotes an initial coin offering (ICO) in exchange for compensation tied to the sale may be breaking the law if they don’t first register with the regulator, Richard Levin, Denver-based chair of fintech and regulation practice at law firm Polsinelli PC, told Bloomberg in a recent interview. Also, as reported, John McAfee, a self proclaimed “crypto visionary” and software tycoon, said he will stop recommending ICOs because of unspecified “threats” from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.",2018-06-27

BTC/USD failed to move above the mentioned resistances and it is currently at a risk of more losses below the USD 6,000 support.

Bitcoin price is currently trading near the USD 6,050 (GMT 08:45 AM) level with an immediate support at USD 6,000. Should there be a downside break below USD 6,000, there could be heavy declines during the following sessions. The next supports are USD 5,800 and USD 5,750.
Alternatively, if bitcoin buyers take a stand and push the price above USD 6,250, there are chances of an extended recovery towards the USD 6,400 level. Ethereum
Ethereum price struggled to move above the USD 450 resistance and is currently down more than 4%. An initial support is near the USD 430 level, below which, there is a risk of further losses towards the USD 420 level.
If the price starts a recovery, it could face heavy offers near USD 450. A break above USD 450 - USD 460 is needed to initiate a decent upward recovery. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash tumbled and failed to stay above the USD 720 and USD 700 support levels. It is currently down around 6% with an immediate support at USD 680. Below this, BCH/USD may perhaps decline back towards the USD 650 support area. Resistance are seen at USD 720 and USD 740.
Ripple price is holding the USD 0.45 support, but it is at a risk of more declines. A break below USD 0.45 and USD 0.44 may well clear the path for a test of USD 0.40. Resistances are at USD 0.475 and USD 0.50. Other Altcoins Market Today
Most small cap altcoins were down today, including EOS, litecoin, stellar, cardano, IOTA, tron, XMR, neo and dash. The market sentiment is currently bearish with many signs of extended losses. It seems like bitcoin and altcoins are struggling to recover above key resistance levels. If they continue to fail, there is a risk of more declines in BTC, ETH, BCH, XRP and other cryptocurrencies.",2018-06-27
" The past few sessions were mostly positive considering bitcoin price moved above the USD 5,750 resistance. BTC/USD even crawled above the USD 6,000 pivot level to move into a short-term uptrend. However, it is facing a significant resistance near USD 6,250 - USD 6,300. Similarly, major altcoins like Ethereum posted intraday gains, but they failed to gain momentum above crucial resistances. Going forward, the market must gain traction to break important barriers and accelerate upsides. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently (GMT 08:40 AM) trading flat near the USD 6,200 level with an immediate resistance at USD 6,250. However, the most important resistance awaits near USD 6,300. Above this last, BTC/USD will most likely stage further recoveries above USD 6,500.
On the flip side, if the price fails to move above USD 6,300, there could be a retest of USD 6,000. Any further declines could push the price back in a downtrend. Ethereum
Ethereum price tested the USD 465 - USD 470 resistance zone and faced a strong selling interest. ETH/USD moved down and is currently trading above the USD 450 support.
Should there be a downside break below USD 450, the price may perhaps decline back towards the USD 420 low. To the topside, resistances are seen at USD 465, USD 470 and USD 480. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price recovered above the USD 750 level and tested the USD 780 resistance. BCH/USD failed to move above USD 780 and declined back towards USD 740. An immediate support is at USD 725, followed by the all-important USD 700.
Ripple price also tested a crucial resistance near USD 0.50, which was a support earlier. XRP/USD failed to gain traction above USD 0.50 and is currently trading above the USD 0.4750 support. Supports on the downside are at USD 0.46 and USD 0.45. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins jumped during the past two sessions. A few coins like THETA, Cortex and Populous gained heavy traction and traded higher between 20%-25%. GNT and CENNZ also posted decent gains today and climbed by 13% and 9% respectively. Overall, there are a few positive signs on charts, but bitcoin price must break the USD 6,300 resistance to extend the current upside. Otherwise, there is a risk of a downside break below USD 6,000 in the near term.",2018-06-26
" Cryptocurrencies have always been the target of speculation and skepticism: from great economists expressing their disbelief in them, to Warren Buffett calling it rat poison squared, the space has not had much rest since its inception. Today, it would seem that the short-term prospects look much worse than the long-term.   While a venture capitalist predicts further drop in the crypto market, Andreessen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley investment powerhouse, has launched a USD 300 million fund focused on the nascent industry. In addition, a survey by a banking giant ING showed that interest in cryptocurrency is expected to more than double (although they don't know when), bringing the prices up as well. The bad news comes first. Spencer Bogart, a blockchain venture capitalist, a partner at Blockchain Capital, told CNBC that he’s “super-bullish on crypto right now” but also believes that the prices will go even lower. A year ago, crypto hedge funds were being formed left and right, and he believes that now, many of these funds are “hitting their one-year lock up.” This could mean people are looking to sell and get out of the space before the prices fall even lower, which would artificially bring them down anyway. And now, the good news. Andreessen Horowitz has announced that the fund is designed to include the best features of traditional venture capital, updated to the modern crypto world. Named a16z crypto, the venture fund will invest in crypto companies and protocols and will be able to hold investments for 10+ years and in all conditions, regardless of coin prices, according to Chris Dixon, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz.  ""We are long-term, patient investors. We’ve been investing in crypto assets for 5+ years. We’ve never sold any of those investments, and don’t plan to any time soon,"" he added.  The fund, co-led by a new general partner at the venture firm Katie Haun, is focused on non-speculative use case, where the value of crypto tokens is driven by the underlying, practical uses cases. ""Although the Bitcoin whitepaper is now almost 10 years old, we believe we are still early in the crypto movement. The infrastructure needs to be improved and the applications are difficult for non-early adopters to use. Many crypto applications still get dismissed as toys. We believe this will change quickly. For one, crypto is purely a software movement and doesn’t depend on a hardware buildout, in contrast to, say, the internet, which required laying cables and building cell towers. Second, the space is developing extremely rapidly, partly because the code, data, and knowledge is largely open source, and partly because of the increasing inflow of talent,"" Dixon continues.  Meanwhile, the survey by ING might support his vision. Surveying nearly 15,000 people across 13 countries the bank said that fewer than one in 10 Europeans currently own cryptocurrency, but that 16% of respondents expect to own it in the future. Most surprisingly, 15% of them said they would be open to receiving their salary in cryptocurrency. More than a third of participants believe cryptocurrency is the future of spending online. ""Cryptocurrency remains an abstract investment for many, but there may be more appetite for digital currencies than some might suggest,"" said Jessica Exton, a behavioural scientist at ING, Independent reported. If cryptocurrency stabilises there may be increased interest, she added.",2018-06-26
" Tether, the company behind the controversial, yet all-important cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar, on Monday issued USD 250 million in new USDT tokens.  New Tether tokens being issued means more money is making its way into the cryptocurrency market, which could help set the stage for a price comeback in a market that has seen heavy selling over the past two months. The 250 million new tokens released on Monday marks the first significant issuance of Tether tokens since May 18, when the company also released 250 million tokens. Back then, bitcoin rose by about USD 400 in the days that followed before it sold off heavily again a few days later. If history repeats itself, we therefore may see another bitcoin rally following this most recent issuance. Bitcoin price chart: Tether has received its share of criticism from members of the cryptocurrency community over a lack of transparency in the way it issues new Tether tokens. While the company says each token in circulation is backed by USD 1 in their bank account, they have failed to provide conclusive evidence to back up their claim. Earlier in June, Tether announced that they had passed a solvency test by law firm Freeh Sporkin & Sullivan LLP. Although the test didn’t meet the criteria of a formal audit, the law firm stated that it was “confident that Tether’s unencumbered assets exceed the balance of fully-backed USD Tethers in circulation as of June 1st, 2018.” As of press time, bitcoin traded nearly unchanged for the day, well above the USD 6,000 mark. Shortly after the release of the new tokens, Litecoin creator Charlie Lee shared his optimistic view on Twitter: Generally, this has been a precursor of price going up. Tether gets printed when people deposit USD and get USDT back. This USDT will then be used to buy crypto. This is similar to someone depositing $250MM to exchanges. Of course, that doesn't mean they will buy right away. DYOR https://t.co/zg2PEjGohv",2018-06-26
" The founder and chairman of a China's giant Alibaba Group, one of the Chinas' richest men, Jack Ma, has declared Bitcoin a bubble once again, just as his Ant Financial launched blockchain-based money transfers between Hong Kong and the Philippines today.  This service, designed to compete with banks and traditional remittance services, is currently available only for transfers between Hong Kong and the Philippines, according to Ant Financial.  The billionaire said he wants to make it possible for people to remit even 1 cent at almost no cost, compared with the high fees charged by traditional remittances services like MoneyGram, which Ant tried to buy last year. “Due to reasons from the US our deal with MoneyGram did not succeed, so I said, ‘Let’s make one better [than MoneyGram]’ that uses the most advanced technology,” Ma said at the launch in Hong Kong, adding that the impact of blockchain on people and society will be “greater than we can ever imagine,” according to the report in the South China Morning Post, which is owned by Alibaba. “Bitcoin, however, could be a bubble,” he added, Bloomberg reports. “Blockchain should not be a tech to get rich overnight […] There are still 1.7 billion people in the world who have no bank accounts, but most of them have mobile phones.”  This is not the first time Ma expressed his skepticism towards the cryptocurrency. “Blockchain is not a bubble, but Bitcoin is,” is his opinion, as he shared it multiple times. “It’s just not for me,” remains his opinion, first said in December 2017. Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba’s backed by some of the biggest names in global finance and investment, has explored blockchain technology for years.  Now, users of AlipayHK - the Hong Kong version of Ant’s Alipay wallet - should be able to transfer money within seconds to users of GCash. The first three months are a trial period during which transaction fees will be waived. The disadvantages of traditional remittance outlets include long waiting times, lack of transparency, high transaction costs, and unfavourable exchange rates.  This is among the problems for Filipinos working overseas, for whom sending money to their families’ GCash mobile wallets will “soon be the norm,” says Anthony Thomas, president of Mynt, the operator of GCash. Eric Jing, chief executive of Ant Financial, said in a statement, “This is a new starting point and significant step forward in accelerating Alipay’s pace to promote tech for good and financial inclusion globally.” A banking giant Standard Chartered will act as the settlement bank for both AlipayHK and GCash for the blockchain transactions Hong Kong financial technology company TNG Wallet already provides mobile remittances via digital wallets, but it does not use blockchain.",2018-06-25
" Bitcoin price declined further during the weekend and broke the USD 6,000 support. BTC/USD traded towards the USD 5,600 level, found support, and later started an upward correction. The price is back above the USD 6,000 level, but buyers are facing many challenges to the topside. Similarly, major altcoins like ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash are showing signs of a recovery, but are facing crucial resistances. Going forward, there could be more recoveries in bitcoin, ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash if they succeed in surpassing the USD 6,500, USD 485, USD 0.50, and USD 800 resistances respectively. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently up more than 5% to USD 6,140 (GMT 08:45 AM). BTC/USD may continue to grind higher if it manages to break the USD 6,250 barrier, which is a crucial pivot zone. Above this, the next major hurdle for more upsides is at USD 6,500.
On the other hand, if bitcoin fails to move above USD 6,250, there could be another bearish reaction. An initial support is at USD 6,000, followed by USD 6,850. Below this last, the price may perhaps trade to a new low below USD 5,600. Ethereum
Ethereum tumbled further and it almost tested the USD 400 handle. ETH/USD traded near USD 420 before recovering back above USD 440. The pair is currently facing resistances near USD 450 and USD 460.
However, the most important hurdle for buyers is at USD 485, above which, the price may stage a decent correction above the USD 500 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price struggled a lot this past week and settled below USD 800. It even broke the USD 700 support before buyers appeared. Weekly resistances are at USD 780, USD 800 and USD 850. Supports are seen near USD 720, USD 700 and USD 650.
Ripple settled below a crucial support at USD 0.50. It is currently correcting higher, but is facing resistances at USD 0.48 and USD 0.49 before USD 0.50. XRP/USD must move back above USD 0.50 to recover further. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins declined heavily during the weekend. Today, a few got traction and jumped by more than 20% like WICC, Cortex, THETA and ONT. A few other coins like LOOM, CMT, XMR, ETC and DROP also traded higher and posted gains between 8-15%. To sum up, the market is showing signs of a decent comeback, but bitcoin price must break the USD 6,500 resistance.

" Infamous, and now defunct, cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox has begun the process for a civil rehabilitation, as bankruptcy proceedings are put on hold. Announced on Friday by their trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi, the exchange has just today been awarded permission for this act by the Tokyo District Court, whereas the petition was filed in November 2017. ""Accordingly, enormous assets, which were to be distributed to Mt. Gox’s shareholders under the bankruptcy proceedings, will be returned to creditors of Mt.Gox in civil rehabilitation proceedings. This is the creditors’ victory,"" a group of claimants who had established Mt. Gox Creditors lobby group reacted to the announcement.  They add that ""However, this victory has not been realized yet. The victory will come to creditors when Mt. Gox makes payment to creditors and creditors actually receive such payment."" According to various estimations, as the process moves forward, those who lost funds in what become one of the world’s most famous hacks in history could expect to see their money sometime in the next year.  Also, according to Kobayashi, claims seeking a refund of Bitcoins will not be converted into monetary claims, meaning, that creditors who were affected and wanted to be repaid in Bitcoin may receive larger amounts of cash than those who opted for a payback in fiat. Moreover, it is estimated that Mt. Gox's bitcoin holdings will not need to be sold. Earlier this year, Kobayashi was accused of bringing down the price of the cryptocurrency in February.  However, answering to the question ""Are there future plans to sell Bitcoins and Bitcoin cash?"", Kobayashi explained that ""at present, nothing has been determined.""   Kobayashi will report on the exchange’s assets at a creditors’ meeting on September 26th in Tokyo. After that, all claimants will have until October 22nd to submit their claims. Whereas proofs of rehabilitation claims are going to be examined from January 31, 2019, to February 7, 2019, and submission deadline for proposed rehabilitation plan is February 14, 2019. Launched in July 2010, by 2013 and into 2014 Mt. Gox was handling over 70% of all bitcoin transactions worldwide, as the largest bitcoin intermediary and the world's leading bitcoin exchange, according to Wikipedia. Mt. Gox announced that approximately 850,000 bitcoins belonging to customers and the company were missing and likely stolen, an amount valued at more than USD 450 million at the time. Although 200,000 bitcoins have since been ""found"", the reason(s) for the disappearance—theft, fraud, mismanagement, or a combination of these—were initially unclear. New evidence presented in April 2015 by Tokyo security company WizSec led them to conclude that ""most or all of the missing bitcoins were stolen straight out of the Mt. Gox hot wallet over time, beginning in late 2011.""",2018-06-22
" Yesterday, we discussed that bitcoin price must break the USD 6,800 resistance and if it fails, there is a risk of a bearish reaction. BTC/USD struggled to clear the stated resistance, declined sharply, and broke important supports such as USD 6,700 and USD 6,600. Similarly, ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash declined heavily and moved into a bearish zone.  Overall, it seems like buyers struggled to hold gains in bitcoin and altcoins, suggesting more weakness in the near term. According to Bloomberg, Bitcoin is on its strongest negative trend since the sell-off earlier this year and charts are signaling more losses. Going forward, if bitcoin price fails to recover and drops below USD 6,200, it could decline to new 2018 lows.  Bitcoin
Bitcoin price faced an increased selling interest after it failed to surpass a major resistance at USD 6,800. BTC/USD declined and tested the USD 6,500 support zone, down more than 3.5%.
If it continues to move down, it could even break the USD 6,400 support and test USD 6,200. On the upside, resistances are seen at USD 6,600 and USD 6,700. Ethereum
Ethereum price dropped by more than 7% and broke the USD 515 and USD 500 support levels. On the downside, the next supports are at USD 490 and USD 485. Below this last, ETH/USD may perhaps trade towards USD 460. 
On the upside, there are many resistances, starting with USD 520 up to USD 540. Any further gains depend on the market sentiment in the near term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price declined heavily and broke the USD 860 and USD 850 support levels. BCH/USD is down more than 8% and is testing the USD 800 handle (GMT 8:30 AM). A break below this may perhaps call for a test of the USD 750 support level.
Ripple price just managed to stay above the USD 0.50 support. However, XRP/USD is at a risk of more declines if buyers fail to keep the price above USD 0.50. Other Altcoins Market Today
Most small cap altcoins declined and moved down between 5%-15%. However, two altcoins, CENNZ and GTC grabbed the market attention due to the recent developments, and gained by more than 40%. The current price action suggests that bitcoin price struggled to gain bullish momentum and moved back in a bearish zone.

" Hydro-Quebec, Canada’s biggest electricity provider, has proposed new rules, through which blockchain companies will have to go through a selection process to apply for electricity. The official press release states that these new parameters are in response to an Order-in-Council recently adopted by the government that restricts the amount of electricity sold to blockchain companies. The new regime seeks to allocate up to 500 megawatts, in addition to 120 megawatts of already existing initiatives. Reportedly, the starting rate would be CAD 0.01 (USD 0.0075) per kilowatt hour - 20% more than the industry standard price. Now it’s up to local energy regulator Regie de l’energie to approve the plan. Hydro-Quebec commented on the proposal, “The goal of this process is to both maximize economic spinoffs for Quebec and revenue for Hydro-Quebec - in turn, pushing electricity rates down for customers.” Hydro-Quebec had already temporarily suspended new requests from crypto miners after demand skyrocketed to the point where its short- and medium-term capacity to provide power to the region has been affected. Even back then, an official statement said they would ask the regulator to set aside electricity specifically for crypto miners, and also wants to propose a set rate for mining and blockchain technology-related industries. Canada, and Quebec in particular, had seen crypto migrations since the beginning of this year due to China’s suppression of cryptocurrency mining. Miners had decided to move to the next relatively cheapest region, and Hydro Quebec welcomed the surge of interest but had been unsure of its ability to supply ample energy for the growing sector.",2018-06-22
" Cryptocurrencies have, since their inception and subsequent leap into mainstream awareness, gathered opinions from opposing end of the spectrum. From those hailing the nascent industry as a game changer for the world as we know it, to those equating it to the infamous tulip bubble, everybody has an opinion. Brian Armstrong, CEO and co-founder of Coinbase, US-based cryptocurrency exchange, thinks people are needlessly worried about the current dip: “It can be scary the first time you see it, but to us who have been in the industry for many years, it feels like old news,” he said in a motivational message to his team.   “When there is hype, people are irrationally exuberant. When there is despair, people are irrationally pessimistic. Neither is true,” he continues, adding that the truth is in the middle, and that value correlates to transactions per day and not price. 1/ Shared the following message with the team @coinbase today... pic.twitter.com/XDNDZfCtOp ""I want to encourage you all to ignore the price of crypto and the headlines which will inevitably start to come up. Our job is to rise above that, finding our own intrinsic source of motivation, to come in and do our best work, regardless of what other people think,"" Armstrong said in an attempt to motivate his team. Total cryptocurrency market capitalization: Meanwhile, Chris Concannon, the president of Cboe Global Markets, owner of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, could be successful in demotivating crypto investors. He thinks they should be laying awake at night, fretting over the market movements, especially in relation to ICOs (initial coin offerings) and regulations. Should the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decide ICO tokens are unregistered securities, they would be rendered useless, he told in an interview with Business Insider. Concannon forecasts that, first, the SEC will go after ICO market participants, then, class-action lawsuits against the teams behind ICO projects will surge. ""If you sold someone an unregistered security you are liable to them if they decide to take them to court,"" Concannon said. Who is right - and whether anyone truly is - is anyone’s guess. Armstrong considers the current slump in the market a good way to clear out weak participants. “It gets rid of the people who are in it for the wrong reasons, and it gives us an opportunity to keep making progress while everyone else gets distracted,” he said. Meanwhile, Robert Hockett, a professor of financial regulation at Cornell University, told Business Insider that the cryptoverse is moving out of the ""Wild West"" phase into a ""regulatory scrutiny"" phase. In the short term we'll see the rise of funds to launch class-actions and increased litigation, but in the long term, we'll see a cleansing of the market, according to Hockett. ""It is a legal life cycle of every new asset that becomes highly popular,"" he was quoted as saying. ""It was true for tulips, junk bonds, and mortgage-backed securities, and now crypto.""",2018-06-20
" Pantera Capital’s Digital Asset Fund, one of the best-known hedge funds in the crypto space, fell 26% in May, according to an investor letter sent out by the fund on Tuesday. The loss incurred by Pantera compares with Bitcoins drop of about 15% over the same period. According to a report by Bloomberg, the Digital Asset Fund is currently down by 51% for the year. The fund’s underperformance relative to Bitcoin was mainly due to investments in cryptocurrencies Dash, Waves, Bitshares and OmiseGo, Pantera’s CEO Dan Morehead said in the letter. In the letter, the California-based fund also took aim at Warren Buffet for his negative view on crypto, pointing out that his company, Berkshire Hathaway, avoided the Internet boom in the early 2000s, and therefore missed great investment opportunities in companies like Facebook, Google, and Netflix. “If Berkshire buys Bitcoin as quickly as Apple — it will be in 2045. Buckle in,” the letter said. While 2017 saw an explosion in the number of new crypto hedge funds being set up, 2018 has so far been rather depressing for money managers in this emerging industry. Autonomous Research, an independent research provider on the financial sector, has previously estimated that up to 10 percent of all crypto hedge funds may be forced to shut down this year as they struggle to attract new capital.",2018-06-20
" Bitcoin price was able to form a base around the USD 6,400 pivot level for an upward move. BTC/USD climbed higher and broke a few hurdles such as USD 6,550 and USD 6,600. Similarly, Ethereum broke the USD 500 resistance to move into a positive zone. Many altcoins staged a comeback and moved higher between 5%-10% during the past three sessions. It seems like the market is preparing for a decent recovery and looks set for more upsides. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price climbed above the USD 6,750 level recently before correcting to USD 6,700. BTC/USD is trading higher by more than 3% with bullish moves. On the upside, the price is facing a crucial resistance just below USD 6,800.
Therefore, a successful push above the USD 6,800 hurdle is needed for an upside acceleration. The next resistances are USD 6,880 and USD 7,000. Supports on the downside are at USD 6,600 and USD 6,550. Ethereum
Ethereum price followed bitcoin and jumped above a major resistance at USD 500. It opened the doors for more gains and ETH/USD traded a few points above the USD 520 level.
At the outset, the price is trading nicely above the USD 500 - USD 510 zone. To the topside, a break above USD 530 could accelerate gains in the near term towards USD 560. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price attempted a close above the USD 900 barrier. It failed, but the current market sentiment for BCH/USD is positive with gains more than 5%. The pair may perhaps break the USD 900 resistance soon to stage a decent upward move towards USD 940 and USD 950.
Ripple price traded higher and tested the USD 0.55 resistance before retreating back to USD 0.54. XRP/USD is trading with a bullish sentiment and it will most likely surpass USD 0.55 to gain momentum.  Other Altcoins Market Today

Out of these, Ethereum Classic is performing really well and it seems like ETC/USD may perhaps trade past USD 16.00 resistance during the coming sessions. To sum up, the market is showing a lot of recovery signs. Having said that, bitcoin must break the USD 7,000 hurdle to confirm a short-term bottom.

" Despite the Chinese central government’s best efforts to drive bitcoin miners out of the country, miners in the more remote interior regions, including Sichuan and Qinghai Province, have shown a surprising resilience, according to a recent report by Nikkei Asian Review. The report also mentions that bitcoin mines in western China’s Qinghai Province are often owned and operated by a group of young people referred to as ‘fuerdai,’ a term used to describe the rich children of the new Chinese elite. With both provinces being considered relatively poor compared to the more developed coastal regions in China, bitcoin mining is seen as viable way to create jobs and generate revenues for the local government, according to the report. Additionally, Sichuan and Qinghai Province both enjoy cheap and often heavily subsidized electricity, making it an ideal location for large-scale bitcoin mining. Nikkei Asian Review further speculates that the reason why Chinese authorities have condoned the activity is due to a desire to better control the flow of money internationally, in an effort to counter the global influence the US exercises through the US dollar. It is estimated that China still controls more than 50% of global bitcoin mining capacity, a fact that just this last week prompted Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse to accuse the digital currency of being “controlled by China.”",2018-06-19
" Phillip Nunn, a high-profile blockchain consultant, online influencer and popular public speaker, said in an interview with BusinessCloud.co.uk that he stands by a bold price prediction for bitcoin that he made earlier this year. Nunn predicted back in January of this year that bitcoin would reach a low of USD 6,000 in 2018 before it will rebound to a high of around USD 60,000 by the end of the year. In the interview, Nunn said that even as the bears have dominated the bitcoin market as of late, volatility will ultimately work in favor of the bulls, and added: “I absolutely stand by my prediction.” “What you've got to remember is that the sharpest comparison to crypto in recent years is the dotcom-era, but actually crypto is a whole industry in reverse because the initial investment into it is from the crowd,” he explained. Nunn also told the newspaper that since virtually all the money in the crypto space is from the general public, prices of cryptocurrencies tend to follow investor sentiment rather than normal market fundamentals. “[…] A flood of bad news can wobble the market, stuff like regulation. The industry is so small that there's market manipulation,” Nunn added. Meanwhile, Tom Lee, Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, still thinks that bitcoin could hit USD 25,000 despite the recent drop. Lee believes that once institutional investors jump into the market, there could be solid gains in bitcoin. Following the strong sell-off last week, bitcoin prices have consolidated over the weekend and appears to have found support around USD 6,400 as of press time.",2018-06-18
" Bitcoin price was able to recover during the past three sessions above the USD 6,400 and USD 6,500 levels. However, BTC/USD was not able to gain momentum above the USD 6,700 level. Similarly, major altcoins recovered and corrected higher by around 5%, but they all faced many barriers on the upside which prevented gains. The current price action is positive, but buyers need to gather momentum to avoid a bearish reaction. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price recovered above a major resistance at USD 6,500, pushing the market sentiment into a short-term bullish zone. BTC/USD traded close to the USD 6,700 level where sellers took a stand. The price is currently (GMT 6:00 AM) up more than 1% and is trading in a positive zone.
However, buyers need to push the price above the USD 6,700 level to gain upside momentum. On the downside, supports are seen near the USD 6,500 and USD 6,400. If the price stays above the USD 6,400 support, it could continue to move higher. Ethereum
Ethereum price traded above the USD 520 level with positive signs. It is currently up more than 4% and is trading nicely above the USD 500 level. On the upside, should there be a bullish break above the USD 520 level, there could be an upside acceleration above the USD 540 level.
On the downside, a key support is at USD 500. Below this, the price may perhaps move back in a bearish zone towards the USD 480 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price failed to break the USD 900 resistance level once again. BCH/USD is currently trading above the USD 850 level with ranging moves. The price may soon make the next move either above USD 900 or below USD 850 in the near term.
Ripple price traded a few points above the USD 0.5500 resistance, which is a positive zone. The next barrier for XRP/USD is around the USD 0.5700 level where sellers are likely to appear. Other Altcoins Market Today
The market sentiment improved recently and pushed small cap altcoins in a bullish zone. Today, a few coins such as MOAC, BTCP, KCS and MITH gained momentum and climbed between 10-18%. Overall, it seems bitcoin buyers are keeping downsides in check. A close above the USD 6,700 and USD 6,800 resistance levels could boost the sentiment further in the near term.",2018-06-15
" Some of the weakness seen in bitcoin over the past week was likely caused by futures contracts reaching their expiry date, according to Tom Lee, Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors. In a report released on Thursday, Lee blames the sell-off on “significant volatility” around futures expiry dates on the CBOE and CME futures marketplaces. He further cites a theory by Justin Saslaw, cryptoasset investor at Raptor Capital Management, that says bitcoin seems to fall as the related futures are nearing their expiry date. “Bitcoin sees dramatic price changes around CBOE futures expirations... We compiled some of the data and this indeed seems to be true,” Lee wrote in the report. Furthermore, Lee explained that the inflow of new capital to the crypto market this year has been insufficient to make up for the new supply coming from initial coin offerings (ICOs), mining rewards, and outflows due to capital gains taxes. Increased volatility in the underlying markets when futures contracts expire is a well-known phenomenon from stocks and other traditional financial markets. There have been six expirations since CBOE launched their bitcoin futures, with the most recent expiry being on Wednesday June 13. Bitcoin has taken a strong hit this past week, trading down from about USD 7,500 last Sunday to a low of USD 6,135. On Thursday, bitcoin saw a strong rebound and is trading at around USD 6,600 at press time.",2018-06-15

Bitcoin price fell further after sellers managed to push the price below the USD 6,400 level. BTC/USD declined a few points below the USD 6,200 support, but later it managed to form a support base near the stated level.
The price started an upward correction and moved above the USD 6,300 level. However, there are many hurdles waiting around the USD 6,700. A break and close above the mentioned hurdle is needed for an upside break toward USD 7,000. Ethereum
Ethereum price settled below the USD 500 level and traded close to USD 450. Later, ETH/USD started an upward move and climbed above the USD 475 level. The price is currently up around 1% and is facing a tough resistance near the USD 500 level.
The price has to move above the USD 500 level to recover further in the near term. On the downside, supports are seen near the USD 460 and USD 450 levels. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price is still struggling as it settled below the USD 900 support. BCH/USD is currently up around 1%, but it is way below the USD 900 pivot level. Supports are seen on the downside around the USD 850 and USD 840 level.

" Remember that amazing crypto price surge that happened last December? Of course you do. Well, a group of researchers are claiming these prices were artificially inflated, and some of their colleagues are saying they actually might be onto something. John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas, and Amin Shams, a graduate student, published a report entitled “Is Bitcoin Really Un-Tethered?”, which claims that Bitcoin’s December prices (and alt-coins’ prices, consequently) were manipulated by someone, or a group of people, through the use of the Tether cryptocurrency, and via the Bitfinex exchange - a cryptocurrency exchange that creates and sells Tether.  Tether, or USDT, is a cryptocurrency whose price always equals to that of the US dollar and is used to mediate when trading between different cryptocurrencies. This report, which you can find on this link, isn’t linked to any ‘hard’ evidence, like emails or related documents, but it does rely on numbers. It says that half of all the price surges Bitcoin has seen in the last year happened right after Tether flowed into a few accounts on different exchanges. Usually, this transfer would happen while the price was going down. Speaking to Bloomberg, the author says Tether was used to both stabilize and manipulate the price of Bitcoin.  “Bitfinex nor Tether is, or has ever, engaged in any sort of market or price manipulation,” Bitfinex Chief Executive Officer JL van der Velde said in an emailed statement, according to Bloomberg. “Tether issuances cannot be used to prop up the price of Bitcoin or any other coin/token on Bitfinex.” However, Griffin’s and Shams’ colleagues have voiced their opinions, and they’re saying this report could hold water, if nothing else - because similar methods have been used before to spot price manipulations. According to the New York Times, the report has gotten support from Philip Gradwell, the chief economist at Chainalysis, a blockchain research company, as well as Sarah Meiklejohn, a professor at the University College London (one of the early pioneers of this type of manipulation spotting). The US Justice Department is allegedly looking into possible Bitcoin price manipulation, as well. Also, as reported, the US regulator known as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has launched an investigation into potential price manipulation at four major cryptocurrency exchanges: Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Kraken. The CFTC has subpoenaed the exchanges to hand over sensitive trading data to help in the investigation.",2018-06-13
" Top credit ratings agencies are mulling a plan to downgrade banks that clear bitcoin futures if the volumes of the contracts continues to increase, according to a report by financial news website risk.net on Wednesday. Ratings agencies, including Fitch, S&P and Moody’s, are assessing the impact of bitcoin futures on credit rating. “[The impact on ratings] is something that we think is perhaps not fully appreciated by the market and something that warrants monitoring going forward,” Nathan Flanders, Global Head of Non-Bank Financial Institutions at Fitch Ratings, was quoted as saying.  “For banks, even though they are saying they are not directly engaging in the trading of cryptocurrencies as clearing members, they have some indirect exposure to it, whether they like it or not,” Flanders added. The move came as volumes in the bitcoin futures markets have increased steadily since December last year, when the markets went live on US exchanges CME and CBOE. This has happened despite the fact that the bitcoin price has been in a strong downtrend. On a single trading session on April 26, the combined volume of bitcoin futures on CME and CBOE reached an all-time high of USD 670 million, according to CCN. Although bitcoin futures are traded on exchanges regulated by the US government, the rising volume may have alarmed ratings agencies, which apparently have grown increasingly concerned of potential risks due to the volatility of the bitcoin price. Since December, the price of bitcoin in the spot market has dropped by 66% in a four-month period.",2018-06-13
" Bitcoin price finally found a strong buying interest near the USD 6,500 and USD 6,600 levels. BTC/USD started an upside correction and is currently recovering above USD 6,800 (GTM 12:10 PM). Similarly, major altcoins are trading with a stable bias above the recent lows and are consolidating. Overall, it seems like the crypto market is currently consolidating losses and there could be further recoveries in the near term. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently trading above the USD 6,750 level with consolidation moves. BTC/USD may correct a few points in the near term toward the USD 6,900 and USD 7,000 levels, which are likely to act as resistances for buyers.
Should there be an upside break above the USD 7,000 level, the price may continue to recover in the near term. On the flip side, if recoveries are capped by the USD 7,000 level, there could be a bearish reaction back towards USD 6,600 in the near term. Ethereum
Ethereum price also corrected higher and moved above the USD 510 and USD 520 levels. However, ETH/USD is facing a strong resistance near the USD 540 - USD 550 zone. An upside break above the mentioned zone is needed for the price to recover toward USD 600.
On the other hand, if the price fails to move past USD 550, there is a risk of another downside reaction towards the USD 510 and USD 500 support levels. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price is holding the USD 900 level with consolidation moves. On the upside, resistances are seen near the USD 950 and USD 960 levels. On the downside, there are many supports around the USD 920 and USD 900 levels.
Ripple price is signaling a decent price action above the USD 0.55 level. However, ETH/USD has to move above the USD 0.60 level to gain bullish traction in the near term. Above this, the price may recover towards USD 0.62. Other Altcoins Market Today
A few small cap altcoins moved into the bullish zone such as Loom Network, Ethereum Classic, Dropil and CyberMiles.

Similarly, all major altcoins declined sharply and broke key support levels. The current market sentiment is very bearish, pointing more declines in the near term. ""A deeper analysis reveals that the media may be attributing too much of this plunge to the CoinRail hack,"" Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, said in a market commentary.

""At the moment, we know that the infrastructure is still under construction, and some very big investors stand ready to enter the market. However, they will most likely wait until an upswing to join in.

Bitcoin price failed to surpass the USD 7,800 barrier on many occasions, which resulted in a downside reaction. BTC/USD declined heavily and moved below the USD 7,000 handle. It almost traded close to the USD 6,500 support level and formed a low around USD 6,600.
At the moment, the price is currently consolidating losses above the USD 6,500 support. On the upside, there are a few important resistances around the USD 6,800 and USD 7,000 levels. Supports are near USD 6,600 and USD 6,500. Ethereum
Ethereum was rejected from the USD 620 barrier, which ignited a sharp downside move. ETH/USD tumbled and broke a few important supports such as USD 560 and USD 550. The price traded close to the USD 500 and a low was formed near USD 510.
On the upside, there are resistances near the USD 550 zone. Above this, the price will most likely face a strong resistance near the USD 580 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price also declined heavily and broke the USD 1,040 and USD 1,000 support levels. BCH/USD traded close to the USD 950 support and is currently correcting higher. On the upside, resistances are at USD 1,000, USD 1,020 and USD 1,040.
Ripple price broke a key pivot level at USD 0.65, opening the doors for more losses. XRP/USD even settled below the USD 0.60 level and moved into a bearish zone. If there is an upside correction, the price could face hurdles near the broke USD 0.60 level. Other Altcoins Market Today

" The price of bitcoin fell sharply on Sunday and early Monday morning after Coinrail, South Korea’s 7th biggest exchange said it was hacked, possibly to the tune of over USD 37.3 million. According to data from Coinbase, bitcoin dropped 10% to around USD 6,770 – the lowest level for the cryptocurrency since April 12. On Monday morning, the price was still hovering below the USD 6,800 level, after a slight increase during the early hours of the Asian trading session. The sell-off on Sunday followed news reports about a hack at Coinrail. The exchange said it was the victim of a “dawn raid” on its wallets on June 10, with hackers active on its system for up to 40 minutes, where they succeeded in accessing Pundi X (NPXS), Aston (ATX) and NPER funds. Some media reports claim Tron funds were also affected, and that the total losses may actually exceed USD 40 million, but the company has not yet issued confirmation. The company, which is the seventh biggest in the country by trading volume, says it has suspended all operations, and has safeguarded 70% of its customers’ funds. Also, Coinrail says it has successfully “frozen or recalled” some 66% of the hacked funds and stated that all of its assets are now in a cold wallet, where they will remain until the company’s network “has been stabilized.” Per a company statement, Coinrail also said it was working in close collaboration with the police. While most media sources in South Korea are claiming that over USD 37 million was taken, Coinrail is yet to confirm or deny these estimates, stating, “The exact extent of the damage is currently being calculated, and this may take some time.” The company said that it was unable to reveal many of the details of the hack as doing so “may interfere with the police investigation,” but added that it was in close talks with the coins’ developers. Joongang Ilbo points out that Coinrail had run into trouble with the Fair Trade Commission this year over clauses in its terms and conditions that appeared to absolve the company of blame in the event of “damages.” As reported previously on Cryptonews.com, a total of 12 exchanges (of which Coinrail was one) were ordered to make significant changes to “unfair” customer policies in April. The FTC claimed that exchanges’ terms “did not exempt them from liability” in the event of the loss or theft of customer funds. Exchange hackings have become a major issue for the cryptocurrency market in recent years, and continues to shake the market every time they occur. It is estimated that since 2014, hackings on exchanges have cost investors at least USD 1.4 billion. However, according to Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, a deeper analysis reveals that the media may be attributing too much of this plunge to the CoinRail hack. He stressed that the big drop came more than 15 hours after the news was fully digested by the markets: ""The industry has certainly seen much bigger hacks before and other than a technical price level, this doesn't change much for the path of the industry over the next five years.""

" Robert Sluymer of Fundstrat Global Advisors spoke for CNBC’s Fast Money on Thursday, saying that he believes Bitcoin is bottoming out at USD 7,000 and that it could start rising again as soon as within the next few days. Bitcoin has previously indeed started rising after hitting the USD 7,000 mark, and Sluymer believes this to be the first step in price recovery. “Bitcoin is stuck in purgatory,” Melissa Lee of CNBC begins, while Bob Pisani of the New York Stock Exchange says that the current narrow range of around USD 600 is unusual for Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. Bitcoin futures trading volume fell since May, with Asian markets less intimidated than the US ones. The US Securities and Exchange Commission regulatory issues are also considered one of the constraints for cryptocurrency prices recently. Growing numbers of trading desks for cryptocurrencies are also a surprising turn of events, as this may be the only area where those are rising. Guy Adami, an American trader, TV personality, and professional investor, considers this healthy, as it speaks of the marketplace maturing. Sluymer, meanwhile, points out that the long-term trend is still technically up when considering the graph of price fluctuation since 2016. All lows were a series of high lows compared to the previous ones. In his opinion, Bitcoin is currently in the bottoming phase, and now it’s at the point where it’s challenging its downtrend, but that it needs to get through USD 7,800 to prove its trend reversal. As previously reported, according to a popular crypto analyst, Willy Woo, the USD 8,000 support was bound to give up. He thinks that the next support sits near USD 7,000, which may perhaps break if sellers remain in control. Finally, there may possibly be a correction going into the July-September period, followed by an accumulation phase.",2018-06-08
" Bitcoin price did not break the USD 7,750 resistance and corrected a few points lower. There was no major downward move and the current wave can be a consolidation phase. Similarly, major altcoins such as ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and litecoin traded in a tiny range with a slight bearish angle. The current technical structure suggests that bitcoin and altcoins may correct a few points, but the overall bias is still positive. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price started a minor downside correction and traded below the USD 7,700 level. BTC/USD is currently trading flat around the USD 7,600 (GMT 09:10 AM) level with immediate supports near USD 7,580 and USD 7,550. Below this last, the price will most likely retest the USD 7,400 support.
To the topside, the recent high near USD 7,750 may perhaps prevent upsides in the short term. Should bitcoin buyers succeed in clearing the USD 7,750 resistance, there could be more gains toward the USD 8,000 level in the near term. Ethereum
Ethereum was confined in a tiny range below the USD 620 resistance. ETH/USD attempted to break the USD 615 and USD 620 resistance levels on a couple of occasions, but it failed.
The price may decline a few points, but the USD 600 and USD 590 support levels are likely to prevent declines. On the flip side, a break above the USD 620 barrier may possibly open the doors for a push toward the USD 640 - USD 650 zone. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price is down around 2.5% to USD 1,110. BCH/USD struggled to settle above the USD 1,140 level, which ignited a bearish reaction. The price must stay above the USD 1,100 support to bounce back. If not, it could decline towards the USD 1,060 support.
Ripple price is still above the USD 0.65 support level. However, XRP/USD started a minor corrective wave from the USD 0.675 resistance. The pair may correct a few points more in the short term, but it is likely to find a strong buying interest around USD 0.65.  Other Altcoins Market Today
Most small cap coins traded in a range with tiny gains. Altcoins such as BIX, HT, Siacoin, Decred and Waves performed well during the past few sessions and registered more than 5% gains.  Overall, the current price action is mostly ranging. There may be more downsides, but it could be buying opportunity.",2018-06-08
" No matter what experts might say on crypto adoption, real world examples have looked favorably upon the emerging technology. For example, one of the smallest countries in the EU, Slovenia, has announced that its largest shopping center, already named BTC City, will transform into a complete Bitcoin city. Meanwhile, farmers and small businesses in a Russian village have ditched the ruble in favor of cryptocurrency for local trade. Slovenia, the country of origin for one of the oldest crypto exchanges Bitstamp, has announced that every store in BTC City shopping mall will accept cryptocurrency and operate via blockchain technology, Bitcoin Magazine reported. The mall contains over 500 retail stores. It presently holds several travel and tourism ventures, a luxury hotel and casino, a multiplex cinema, a waterpark and the Crystal Palace office park. Representatives of BTC City said, “The development of BTC City into a Bitcoin city is an important step toward the realization of BTC’s openness-oriented strategy, providing its customers and business partners with both freedom and choices regarding their purchases with new forms of payment.” Meanwhile, farmers and small businesses in the Russian village Kolionovo, 80 miles from Moscow, chose to pay with a cryptocurrency called Kolion instead of the ruble because banks charged huge interest rates when lending, CNN reported. A banker turned farmer Mikhail Shlyapnikov created the currency by issuing paper kolions in 2014 which was banned by Russian court in 2015, which made him go for a crypto version, raising USD 500,000 in an initial coin offering. Kolions can’t be mined, but are instead either bought or “plowed” - helping the villagers with farming and construction. Shlyapnikov told CNN, “We now have about USD 2 million in kolions because its value has jumped since the ICO,” and adds that the coin is backed by a reserve of 500 Bitcoin. In his opinion, this cryptocurrency is a way for them to insulate themselves from Russia's financial system.",2018-06-07
" Bitcoin price formed a decent support base around USD 7,500 and started an upward move. It broke a major hurdle near USD 7,650 to place itself in a bullish zone. Similarly, major altcoins gained traction and are currently slowly moving higher. It seems like the crypto market is setting up for more gains in the near term considering the current sentiment remains intact. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price traded higher and cleared a couple of important resistances such as USD 7,650 and USD 7,700. BTC/USD traded close to the USD 7,800 level before retreating to USD 7,710. On the downside, supports are seen near USD 7,650 and USD 7,600, followed by the all-important USD 7,500.
On the upside, the USD 7,750 and USD 7,780 levels are short-term resistances. A push above this last could clear the path for an upside acceleration above the USD 7,800 level to test the USD 8,000 barrier. Ethereum
Ethereum remained stable above the USD 600 handle with positive signs. It seems like ETH/USD is currently consolidating above USD 600 (GMT 9:00 AM) and is preparing for the next major break.
Should the price settle above USD 620, there could be a test of the USD 650 resistance. On the flip side, a downside break below USD 600 may perhaps call for a larger bearish correction toward the USD 570 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price is slowly grinding higher and is currently up more than 1% to USD 1,150. BCH/USD is likely to continue higher towards the USD 1,180 and USD 1,200 resistance levels. On the downside, supports are seen near the USD 1,120 and USD 1,100 levels.
Ripple price is performing really well, and it might soon test the USD 0.70 resistance. A break above the stated resistance will most likely set the pace for a test of the USD 0.75 barrier. Supports on the downside are at USD 0.665 and 0.650.  Other Altcoins Market Today

" Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, remains the best-known pseudonym in the cryptoverse, and this mystery is one many people are content to leave unsolved. Still, every time something new about the mysterious creator surfaces, the community wants to know - at least to add some level of humanity to their hero. Although she/he/they vanished - not quite in a puff of smoke - there are some proverbial breadcrumbs left behind, especially in Bitcoin’s whitepaper. He also posted in some forums and exchanged emails with some early Bitcoin developers. One of them was Laszlo Hanyecz, best known for buying two pizzas using 10,000 Bitcoins, now worth USD 77 million, which brought the Bitcoin Pizza Day to life as some sort of holiday. According to Business Insider, Hanyecz had been mining bitcoins on his laptop and he expressed interest in contributing to the cryptocurrency's development online. The developer claims that over the coming year, Nakamoto sent him tasks to complete.  Hanyecz calls Nakamoto paranoid, bossy and kind of weird. “He seemed very paranoid about people breaking the software. He kept calling it ‘prerelease,’ and I was helping him get it to release,” he explains. Apparently, Nakamoto consistently gave him a weird feeling.  He says the Bitcoin creator treated him like a full-time employee, although he did the work for Bitcoin for free and as a side gig, since he had a full-time job already.  Also, Nakamoto wasn’t too thrilled with Hanyecz’s mining, either. “He said, ‘Well, I'd rather not have you do the mining too much,’” Hanyecz said. “He was trying to grow the community and get more commerce use cases. He fully recognized that mining would become a thing where a few people would get wealthy.”  Still, the developer says he has deep respect for both Nakamoto's project and the person or team behind the name.",2018-06-06
" Bitcoin found support below the USD 7,400 level and started an upward move. BTC/USD jumped above the USD 7,500 resistance to gain traction. Similarly, major altcoins recovered nicely and moved above key resistances. The best of the lot was Ethereum, breaking the USD 600 barrier. Overall, the market sentiment improved, which could lead more upsides in bitcoin and altcoins in the near term. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently trading 2.5% higher to USD 7,620 (GMT 09:30), with an immediate resistance near the USD 7,680 level. Above this, the BTC/USD pair will most likely accelerate gains towards the USD 7,800 and USD 8,000 resistance levels.
On the flip side, if the price starts a downside correction, the USD 7,500 level may act as a decent support. Below the stated USD 7,500 support, the next key support zone is near the USD 7,400 and 7,350 levels. Ethereum
Ethereum jumped back above the USD 600 barrier, which is a positive sign. However, ETH/USD is struggling to gain upside momentum above the USD 610 and USD 620 resistance levels. Once there is a break above USD 620, the price will most likely revisit the USD 650 zone.
A bearish reaction from the current levels may perhaps push the price back in a negative zone below USD 600. The next key supports on the downside are at USD 580 and USD 575. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple

" Both Bitcoin and initial coin offerings (ICOs) are showing signs of slowing down, experts claim. In the case of Bitcoin, Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, a provider of a market insight newsletter, found the correlation between the growth of the number of wallets and the cryptocurrency prices that says Bitcoin wallet growth needs to be +5% per month to see meaningful price appreciation, CNBC reported. However, wallet growth was roughly 2% percent in both April and May.  According to Colas, Bitcoin needs a new narrative in order to reestablish global attention. He added that, “This dog will have its day, but today isn't it. While we love the idea of Bitcoin (and own a little ourselves), we are not fans of buying it at current levels.”  Bitcoin price chart: Bitcoin prices have been struggling this year, especially compared to the all-time high in December. However, interest in Bitcoin is struggling too: Google searches for the term have dropped more than 75% since the beginning of this year and roughly halved over three months. Meanwhile, ICOs are struggling as well. Although the total for this year (USD 9.1 billion) already shot past the total for the entirety of 2017 (USD 6.6 billion), when removing EOS (USD 4.1 billion raised) and Telegram (USD 1.8 billion raised), the monthly trend look severely down. Research by Autonomous Next implies that this dragging is due to “continued regulatory uncertainty, tax overhang, and a lack of tangible progress in software adoption by the mainstream consumer.” However, the research firm goes on to say that we may be “entering the era of mega deals.” Japan is already moving forward with the crypto craze: from Rakuten, an e-commerce and Internet company, tokenizing USD 9 billion of loyalty points, to Mitsubishi bank talking about launching a cryptocurrency. And although last year, most of the projects were built by new teams, this year we are seeing a surge of mid-stage companies (50-250 employees) tokenizing some asset of their existing operations. This implies the possibility of late-stage companies entering the market soon as well, according to Autonomous Next. ""Just look at the Internet wave: March 2000 was the peak value share a percentage of market capitalizations. Despite the crash, the web has never been more present or important than today. Will crypto follow the same hype cycle curve?"" asks the research firm. ",2018-06-05

The price has to surpass the USD 7,500 and USD 7,600 resistance levels to start a fresh upward wave. Should there be a downside move below USD 7,400, the price may revisit the next major support at USD 7,200 in the near term. Ethereum
Ethereum struggled to hold gains above USD 600 and broke the stated support. ETH/USD declined towards USD 575, which acted as a support and prevented further slides.
Going forward, if the price crawls back above the USD 600 pivot level, it could restart an upside move. Above USD 600, resistances are seen at USD 625 and USD 630. On the flip side, supports are at USD 580 and USD 575. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash declined by more than 3% and settled below USD 1,100. An immediate support is around USD 1,060, followed by USD 1,040. On the upside, BCH/USD has to trade above USD 1,100 and USD 1,120 to move back in a positive zone towards USD 1,180.
Ripple price did not decline much and remained around the USD 0.65 support. XRP/USD is facing hurdles on the upside near the USD 0.68 and USD 0.70 levels. On the downside, a break below USD 0.65 may perhaps push the price towards the USD 0.62 support.  Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, a few small cap altcoins traded with a bullish bias, including Huobi Token, Skycoin, CENNZ, BLX, BNB, CyberMiles and RChain. Overall, the current price action indicates ranging moves in the short term.  However, the next move depends on whether bitcoin price breaks the USD 7,500 - USD 7,600 resistance area or not. A continuous failure to move higher could ignite a bearish reaction in BTC and altcoins.",2018-06-05
" There were decent gains in bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies during the past two days. The best part was a close above the USD 7,500 pivot level in BTC/USD, opening the doors for more upsides. Ethereum also broke the USD 600 barrier and traded above USD 625. At the moment, prices are correcting lower, but approaching important weekly support levels. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price broke the USD 7,500 level and traded towards USD 7,750 where sellers appeared. BTC/USD started a downside correction, but the previous resistance at USD 7,500 is now likely to act as a strong support.
Looking at the higher timeframe charts, the price is placed nicely in a bullish zone with weekly supports at USD 7,500, USD 7,400 and USD 7,250. On the upside, bitcoin buyers are facing major barriers near the USD 7,800 and USD 8,000 levels. Above this last, the price may perhaps move towards USD 8,500. Ethereum
Ethereum performed really well and broke a crucial resistance at USD 600. ETH/USD traded close to the USD 640 level before correcting 3% to USD 605. The pair must hold the USD 600 and USD 580 support levels to stay in the bullish zone. 
Below USD 580, the next major weekly support sits at USD 520. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near USD 630 - USD 640. A push above USD 640 could take the price towards the next key resistance at USD 690. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price broke the USD 1,100 resistance and even cleared the USD 1,200 level before sellers took a stand. BCH/USD corrected lower and moved below USD 1,150. It is currently down 1% to USD 1,125, with weekly supports at USD 1,100 and USD 1,040. Resistances are at USD 1,200 and USD 1,250.
Ripple also gained bullish momentum and settled above the USD 0.65 resistance. As long as the XRP/USD pair is above the USD 0.62, it remains in an uptrend towards USD 0.70 and USD 0.75. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins traded higher recently, but most of them are correcting lower today. A few altcoins to watch out this week are VeChain, Mixin, Tron, EOS, Bancor, Golem, Polymath and BNB. The overall price structure is positive and if bitcoin accelerates gain above USD 7,800, there could be further upsides above USD 8,000 during the upcoming days.",2018-06-04
" Bitcoin price stayed above the USD 7,400 support area during the past three sessions and it mostly consolidated in a range. However, BTC/USD seems to be facing a tough challenge near the USD 7,600 and USD 7,650 resistance levels. On the other hand, altcoins are slowly moving higher and many major cryptocurrencies are poised to break key resistance levels, including Ethereum and ADA. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price remained confined in a range below the USD 7,600 and USD 7,650 resistance levels (GMT 09:00). A successful break and close above USD 7,620 - USD 7,650 is needed for additional gains towards USD 8,000 in the near term.
On the downside, the USD 7,400 level is a crucial support. As long as BTC/USD is above USD 7,400, the pair remains in an uptrend. Should there be a downside break below USD 7,400, the price may move back in a bearish zone to test the USD 7,250 and USD 7,000 support levels. Ethereum
Ethereum is grinding higher and is currently up around 2.8% to USD 585. It seems like the ETH/USD pair may continue to move higher and it could accelerate gains above the USD 600 barrier.
On the flip side, if there is no upside break above USD 600, the price could correct lower. Supports on the downside are seen near USD 560 and USD 550. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is flirting with the USD 1,000 handle. The BCH/USD pair struggled to move above the USD 1,040 resistance, but at the same time, it held the USD 960 support. It seems like the pair might trade in a range for a few more hours before the next break either above USD 1,040 or below USD 960. Ripple price is gaining upside momentum and is currently up 1.5% to USD 0.615. On the upside, XRP/USD is facing resistances near USD 0.62 and USD 0.625. A break above these could push the price towards USD 0.64.  Other Altcoins Market Today
The overall altcoins market is trading in the green zone and if sentiment improves further, there could be more gains. Today, coins such as IOTA, VERI, HT, Ontology, BNB, Bitcoin Private, KNC and NAS gained bullish traction and moved higher between 8-15%. To sum up, bitcoin is placed nicely in a bullish zone, but it must break the USD 7,600 barrier to continue moving higher.",2018-06-01
" Looking at a chart and calling Bitcoin a bubble is a favorite pastime of crypto skeptics - they may even forego the chart and just call it a bubble off the top of their heads. However, economists understand that bubbles are complex things that can’t be recognized without fail before they pop.  According to US economist Hyman Minsky, a bubble has five stages: displacement, boom, euphoria, profit-taking, and panic. If Bitcoin is a bubble, it is at the profit-taking stage with the panic stage just around the corner, Joost van der Burgt, a policy adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, wrote in a recent paper called ""Making Sense of Bitcoin Price Levels"". The displacement phase was after the release of the coin’s whitepaper in 2008, according to him. Back then, very few people knew about Bitcoin, and trading volume and price were small - the first time Bitcoin broke through USD 100 was in 2013, four years after its inception. Van der Burgt writes that the next stage, the boom, was obvious: “The subsequent ‘boom’ phase is characterized by prices rising slowly at first, but then gaining momentum as more and more participants enter the market, fearful of missing out.” Euphoria comes with the hype remaining even as the prices lose their volatility: “The euphoria phase is also when people start to borrow extensively to finance their investments. According to a recent survey, 18% of active bitcoin investors have financed their investments by credit card, and 22% of this group indicated that they have not yet paid off their credit card balance,” he explains. This means now is the profit-taking stage, where savvy investors leave, preparing the ground for the panic stage which would see prices crashing. It may not come to pass after all, however: “Then again, maybe bitcoin is different than anything we have seen before, and maybe a decade from now its market capitalization will be sky-high as it attains the status of a new global currency.” Bubble stages: Bitcoin price chart: Meanwhile, Dan Morehead, founder of Pantera Capital Management, a crypto investment firm, told CNBC that ""all cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now"" and encouraged to buy now and ""participate in the rally as it goes"".",2018-06-01
" The past few sessions were mostly bullish for bitcoin and altcoins. BTC/USD corrected a few points yesterday, but the decline was well protected by buyers. Bitcoin price is now back above the USD 7,400 level and is currently trading in a bullish zone. Similarly, there was a minor correction in altcoins such as ethereum, bitcoin cash, ripple and ADA, but prices recovered from key support levels. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price corrected lower and tested the USD 7,300 support area. Later, BTC/USD bounced back and is currently trading above the USD 7,500 level (GMT 09:00 AM). On the upside, an initial resistance sits at USD 7,600, followed by USD 7,620.
A successful break above USD 7,620 will most likely open the doors for a test of USD 8,000. On the downside, the USD 7,400 level is an important support. Below this, the price may perhaps retest the USD 7,300 and USD 7,250 support levels. Ethereum
Ethereum completed a downside correction and is currently trading 1.5% higher to USD 570. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 580, above which the price could accelerate above USD 600.
On the downside, the USD 550 level is an important support levels. As long as ETH/USD is placed above the USD 550 level, it may perhaps continue to move higher. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is holding gains above the USD 1,000 level, which is a positive sign. On the upside, the USD 1,020 and USD 1,040 are key barriers for more gains before BCH/USD makes an attempt to break USD 1,080. On the downside, the USD 980 and USD 960 levels are decent supports.
Ripple price is also holding gains above an important level at USD 0.60. XRP/USD is facing hurdles near the USD 0.62 level, above which the price could move towards the USD 0.64 level.  Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, Golem and BNB gained around 14% and 12% respectively. GNT broke the USD 0.60 resistance, and BNB price surged above the USD 14 level.
The overall price structure is positive as long as bitcoin price is above USD 7,250. Additionally, if buyers succeed in pushing the price above USD 7,620, it could increase bullish pressure and BTC/USD might rally towards USD 8,000.",2018-05-31
" “Something good may come out of this,” Nobel-winning economist and Yale professor Robert Shiller said when asked about cryptocurrencies in a recent interview with CNBC.  Also, he stressed that Bitcoin is not a bad thing: “I don’t mean to be dismissive of Bitcoin. It looks like a bubble, but it’s getting people enthusiastic and they’re making different kinds of cryptocurrencies.” However, in his opinion, Bitcoin might fade away, be renamed and go through many hard forks, and might turn out to be a bubble. “Bitcoin won't look anything like it is today. It will have a different name, if it exists. There will have been many hard forks, changing it and changing it. And, it'll be a matter of dispute whether it exists or not.” When asked whether his students are interested in cryptocurrencies, he laughs and says yes. One even asked him if he could keep his laptop open during a final exam to complete a trade, and he let him as it showed true enthusiasm. At the end 2017, Shiller stated his certainty that Bitcoin will collapse: “Bitcoin, it’s just absolutely exciting ( …) You’re fast. You’re smart. You’ve figured out nobody else understands. You’re with it. And Bitcoin has this anti-government, anti-regulation feel. It’s such a wonderful story. If it were only true.”  Here is what six Nobel laureate economists have to say about crypto.",2018-05-31
" Yesterday, we discussed that bitcoin and altcoins are trading near crucial support levels. BTC/USD formed a key bottom above the USD 7,000 level and surged higher by more than USD 400. Similarly, other major cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash bounced back sharply and are currently trading in a bullish zone. The current market sentiment is positive, signaling more gains in the short term. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price surged higher and broke the USD 7,250 and USD 7,400 resistance levels. BTC/USD is currently up by 5.2% to USD 7,500 (GMT 9:00 AM), with an immediate resistance at USD 7,540. Above this, the price must break the USD 7,600 barrier for more gains in the near term.
On the downside, the broken supports at USD 7,400 and USD 7,250 are likely to act as supports if the price corrects lower. Below USD 7,250, the price could move back in the bearish zone towards USD 7,000. Ethereum
Ethereum price also formed a solid support near USD 500 and started an upward move. It traded up by more than USD 50 and tested the USD 570 resistance.
ETH/USD is currently up by 7.5% to USD 560, with an immediate resistance at USD 570. A break above this could open the doors for a push towards the all-important USD 600 resistance. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash moved back above the USD 1,000 level and it is currently up by 11.2%. If BCH/USD manages to hold the USD 1,000 level, there may well be more upsides towards the USD 1,050 level. On the downside, supports are at USD 960 and USD 940.
Ripple price rallied and moved above the USD 0.60 hurdle. XRP/USD is up by 9.5% to USD 0.609 and it looks set to extend the current rally towards the USD 0.62 and USD 0.65 in the near term.  Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap coins rallied during the past three sessions, including BCN, THETA, 0x, MITH, Augur, ICON, Kin, Golem, IOTA, Fusion and GXS. BCN performed very well and gained more than 25%.  The current price action suggests that bitcoin and many altcoins bounced back from key supports. Should BTC/USD accelerate above USD 7,550, there may perhaps be an extended rally towards USD 8,000.",2018-05-30
" In a decentralized system, where no individual or group holds the majority of power, the only way to seize control is to gain a majority of like-minded individuals. This is the origin of the 51% attack - where the system needs a majority vote to reach consensus. Although a 51% attack in a large distributed network, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum etc. is highly unlikely due to sheer size, smaller coins face a bigger risk simply because there are fewer participants, which makes it easier to manipulate. This is why the website crypto51 was made: a collection of coins and the theoretical cost of a 51% attack on each network, it is not meant to encourage attacks, but to get people talking about the problem and potential solutions. As to how it works, the website explains: “Using the prices NiceHash [a Slovenian cryptocurrency cloud mining marketplace] lists for different algorithms we are able to calculate how much it would cost to rent enough hashing power to match the current network hashing power for an hour.”  Bytecoin is an example of 51% attack potential: with a market cap of around USD 1 billion, it can be 51% attacked for only USD 557, according to the website. While hackers targeting coins such as Bata, Startcoin, Halcyon and some others would require only a few bucks to attack these networks. Since NiceHash doesn’t have the hashing power for larger coins, the website also lists the percentage of the needed hashing power that is available from Nicehash. The attack cost does not include the block rewards that the miner will receive for mining. In either case, recently there have been a number of 51% attacks including attacks on Verge and Bitcoin Gold.  Also, there was in fact a moment, in 2014, when the mining pool Ghash.io came close to obtaining 51% of the whole Bitcoin network. But then some members of the pool voluntary left, decreasing its share. Still, Bitcoin experts believe a 51% attack is very unlikely as its cost would exceed the possible benefits and it would most likely hurt the very attacker. Moreover, such an attack can’t be used to steal bitcoins or change older transactions, as the attacker would be only able to double spend his/hers funds from a recent transaction. Also, any attack would only last for a short time before being quickly fixed by the Bitcoin community.  Bitcoin evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos on 51% Bitcoin attack:",2018-05-29
" Yesterday, we discussed that bitcoin could trade to new lows below USD 7,250. BTC/USD did trade lower and almost tested the USD 7,000 support. Other major cryptocurrencies also followed bitcoin and moved further into the red zone. Looking at the charts, it seems like bitcoin, ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin and ADA are trading near important support levels. Therefore, both scenarios are possible: prices decline further and clear crucial supports or buyers jump into action and a fresh upward recovery is initiated. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently trading above the USD 7,000 (GMT 08:45 AM) support in a tight range. It seems like BTC/USD is consolidating losses and is preparing for the next move. Should there be a bearish break below USD 7,000, the price may perhaps drop to USD 6,500.
On the flip side, if buyers take the stage, bitcoin price could recover towards the USD 7,500 resistance. A successful break above the USD 7,500 resistance is needed for buyers to take control. Ethereum
Ethereum price is also trading near a key support level at USD 500. ETH/USD must hold the stated support to avoid a crash towards USD 450. 
On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 540, above which the price may perhaps make an attempt to move above the USD 580 and USD 600 resistance levels. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is currently trading near the USD 880 - USD 900 support. If BCH/USD fails to recover from the current levels, it may possibly decline further towards the USD 800 handle. Alternatively, a recovery could take the pair towards the USD 1,000 barrier.
Ripple price declined further and tested an important support at USD 0.55. Should there be a daily close below USD 0.55, XRP/USD might drop towards the USD 0.50 support in the near term.  Other Altcoins Market Today

" James Howells is the name of the man who lost a hard drive with the key to more than USD 50 million in Bitcoin. Having gotten into mining in 2009, early enough to make a fortune, he accidentally threw away the hard drive holding thousands of Bitcoins. “I mined more than 7,500 coins over one week’s time in 2009; there were just six of us doing it at the time, and it was like the early days of a gold rush,” the IT worker turned crypto investor told New York Post. “Four years later, I had two hard drives in a desk drawer. One was empty and the other contained my Bitcoin private keys. I meant to throw away the empty drive — and I accidentally threw away the one with the Bitcoin information.” He’s not the only one with such bad luck: Atlanta-based software developer Syl Turner mined two Bitcoins in 2010 and forgot about it. When the price started rising from November on, he found that old computer in the attic, but also found that he had overwritten his private key.  Meanwhile, Howells is still struggling to get his coins back. He’s even offered the town of Newport 10% of the Bitcoins’ value if they’ll let him excavate the landfill. So far, they’ve denied his requests. Still, he considers his coins to be perfectly safe there: “Nobody else can get in there and take my hard drive,” he said. “It’s like having [millions] in the bank, but you cannot get into the bank account.”",2018-05-28
" Total market capitalization this year: The crypto market remained under selling pressure during the past few days, resulting in downsides in bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, ripple and other major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin price settled below the USD 7,600 and USD 7,500 support levels, opening the doors for more losses. Looking at the current market sentiment, there are many bearish signs, which could result in fresh lows this week. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently down around 1% to USD 7,220, with an immediate support at USD 7,150. A break below the stated USD 7,150 support will most likely push the price further lower towards the all-important USD 7,000 level.
If BTC/USD sellers remain in control during the following sessions, there is a risk of a downside break below USD 7,000. On the upside, weekly resistances are at USD 7,500 and USD 7,600. Above this last, the significant hurdle is at USD 8,000. Ethereum
Ethereum tumbled by more than 8% and declined below the last low near USD 550. ETH/USD is currently under heavy selling pressure and it could even test the USD 500 support. Below USD 500, there is an open space up to USD 440.
On the flip side, if the price corrects higher, the previous supports at USD 580 and USD 600 are likely to act as resistance. A daily close above USD 600 is must for a bounce back in ETH in the near term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price settled below a crucial support at USD 1,000, clearing the path for more declines. BCH/USD is currently down 6.5% to USD 925, with an immediate support at USD 900. Weekly resistances are at USD 980 and USD 1,000.
Ripple closed below USD 0.60, which is a strong bearish signal. XRP/USD may now decline further and it could test the next weekly support at USD 0.55, which is an important level. Other Altcoins Market Today
Almost all low cap altcoins declined today, including Nano, Tron, ICON, WAN, Kin, Zcash, KNC, Steem and others. Two altcoins, Civic and All Sports performed well and traded higher by more than 20%.

To initiate a decent recovery, bitcoin must break the USD 7,600 resistance and close above USD 8,000.",2018-05-28
" Bitcoin extended declines yesterday, but buyers were able to hold losses below USD 7,250. BTC/USD formed a short-term bottom pattern with a strong bullish candle and recovered above USD 7,400. Similarly, all major altcoins including ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin and Neo corrected above key resistance levels. The current price action suggests that the market was well bid near weekly lows and prices could correct further higher during the following sessions. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently down 1.3% to USD 7,410 (GMT 8:00 AM) and is holding the USD 7,250 support. The last 4-hour chart was positive, suggesting a slight recovery above USD 7,600. However, the USD 7,600 - USD 7,700 zone is a crucial barrier for buyers. A successful close above the mentioned barrier could open the doors for a test of USD 8,000.
On the downside, price must hold the USD 7,250 support. If buyers fail to defend the stated USD 7,250, there may perhaps be a strong slide towards USD 6,900 in the near term. Ethereum
Ethereum price bounced back sharply and moved above the USD 600 level. However, ETH/USD struggled near the USD 610 - USD 615 region, and is currently down to USD 595. 
It seems like the price may move back above USD 600 during the coming sessions as long as it is above USD 575. Should there be a downside break below USD 575, the price may possibly decline further towards USD 550. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is showing a positive signs above USD 980. BCH/USD is currently up 2.2% to USD 1,010 and is moving with a bullish angle.

" The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has started a criminal probe into potential Bitcoin trading manipulation, but major players remain unfazed. Both Mike Novogratz, a billionaire investor, and Cameron Winklevoss, president and co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini, agree that they’re not surprised by such allegations and that they welcome the investigation. Novogratz, who is setting up cryptocurrency merchant bank Galaxy Digital LP, told Bloomberg, “Weeding out the bad actors is a good thing, not a bad thing for the health of the market. Plenty of exchanges have these inflated volume numbers to create some sense of excitement around coins.” Winklevoss said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg that, “We welcome any inquiry that serves to foster rules-based marketplaces and deter bad actors.” Tom Lee, of Fundstrat Global Advisors, agrees: “This is really welcome news ultimately because this means there is adult supervision coming/here.” Spencer Bogart of cryptocurrency hedge fund Blockchain Capital said he wouldn’t be surprised to find price manipulations rampant: “I don’t have any first-hand evidence of manipulation of Bitcoin prices but given that even the most highly regulated and most liquid markets in the world (e.g. Libor, FX markets, commodities) have consistently proven to be manipulated, it wouldn’t be a huge surprise.” On Thursday, Bloomberg published a report that the DOJ opened a criminal probe into potential manipulation of the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, citing four people familiar with the matter.",2018-05-25

However, according to experts the current drop won’t bother bitcoin bulls. In an email to CNBC, Fundstrat's Tom Lee, stated that the recent slide is mainly due to ""typical crypto volatility"". He still thinks that bitcoin could hit USD 25,000 despite the recent drop. Lee believes, who recently admitted he was wrong to predict the Consensus conference rally, that once institutional investors jump into the market, there could be solid gains in bitcoin.

Bitcoin price is down roughly 3.8% to USD 7,530 (GMT 8:00 AM) with an immediate support at USD 7,500. If BTC/USD accelerate declines below the stated USD 7,500 support, the next major support is near the USD 7,200 level. Below this last, the price may perhaps test the USD 7,000 support.
On the upside, the price is facing a major resistance near USD 7,850. A successful close above USD 8,000 is must for bitcoin to bounce back.  Ethereum
Ethereum price was under a lot of pressure and it almost tested the USD 550 level. ETH/USD tumbled and settled below a key support at USD 600, which can be seen as a strong bearish sign.
At the outset, the price is currently correcting towards USD 600. However, the stated level will most likely act as a resistance and prevent gains above USD 605 - USD 610. On the downside, supports are at USD 650 and USD 660. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash traded lower sharply and even broke a crucial support near USD 1,000. BCH/USD is down 6% and is currently trading near USD 980. If sellers remain in control, the price could slide further towards the USD 950 support.

Looking at the current price action, bitcoin is in a bearish zone and it could decline further. According a popular crypto analyst, Willy Woo, the USD 8,000 support was bound to give up. He thinks that the next support sits near USD 7,000, which may perhaps break if sellers remain in control. Finally, there may possibly be a correction going into the July-September period, followed by an accumulation phase. Technically, the recent break below USD 8,000 was significant. The price could test USD 7,000 as suggested in a tweet by Woo, but it has to stay above the last major low (USD 6,430) to avoid a significant collapse back to USD 5,000. Bitcoin
Today, bitcoin price is down 5.6% to USD 7,840 (GMT 9:00 AM). An immediate support is at USD 7,550, which is a crucial pivot zone. Therefore, if BTC/USD continues to move down, it might face a strong buying interest near USD 7,550. Below this last, the price will most likely head towards USD 7,000.
On the upside, the previous support at USD 8,000 is an important hurdle for buyers. A daily close above USD 8,000, followed by a push above USD 8,200 is required to decrease the current bearish pressure.  Ethereum
Ethereum price tumbled and declined below the USD 650 support. It seems like ETH/USD is heading towards the USD 600 handle, which is a key support. 
It is currently down 11.10% to USD 615. On the upside, resistances are seen near USD 640, USD 645 and USD 650. On the flip side, a break below USD 600 might clear the path for a test of USD 560. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price is down 12% and is trading near the USD 1,050 level. BCH/USD is likely to accelerate declines towards the next major support at USD 1,000. Resistances are at USD 1,080 and USD 1,100.
Ripple extended declines and is currently down 9.5% to USD 0.607. XRP/USD seems to be approaching the USD 0.60 support, below which, the price could accelerate declines to USD 0.50. Other Altcoins Market Today
Almost all altcoins are in the red zone today except ZenCash. ZEN was listed on Binance today, which sparked an upside move and the price moved above the USD 35.00 level. Overall, the current market sentiment is extremely bearish, and a daily close below USD 8,000 in bitcoin will most likely affirm a negative trend.",2018-05-23
" Have you had trouble understanding what Bitcoin really is? Did you find that you understand the basics, but hashes and blocks and mining is too much for you? Worry not, artificial intelligence (AI) is there to save the day! The video was made by Botnik Studios, an entertainment group devoted to displaying the work of the larger community*, and as they say, this is “a very basic stage training on Bitcoin, written using predictive keyboards trained on dozens of Bitcoin explainers.” What their AI came up with probably exceeded everyone’s wildest dreams - but watch for yourself to fully appreciate this work of art. The explanation sounds surreal because it is - cryptocurrency is helping us transcend the traditional sense of humor and elevate our minds to a new plane of consciousness. Or something like that. It does not take an AI to write nonsensical sentences, although they do it better. The comment section of the video features many people who have seen the light: some ask “why does this make sense?” Others write, “Thanks for this video, I was very confused before and now I know everything.﻿” There are those who are already ordering framed prints of especially great sentences, such as “Hashing that code to get some of that Bitcoin” or getting themselves counterfeit coffee. The possibilities are endless.

" Today is May 22, in the cryptoverse known as Bitcoin Pizza Day. Eight years ago, on this day in 2010, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz paid another Bitcoin talk forum user for two Papa John’s pizzas for the low, low price of 10,000 BTC (worth about USD 25 at the time.) Now, that amount would be worth around USD 80 million. Nobody is going to let him forget that. There is a Twitter account @bitcoin_pizza, that only tweets how much those pizzas are worth every day, and how it compares to the previous day. The #Bitcoin pizza is worth $83,131,600 today. (-2% from yesterday) Today is Bitcoin pizza day! Is Hanyecz sorry that he didn’t HODL? He said last year in an interview with the New York Times, “It wasn’t like Bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool. No one knew it was going to get so big.” And today, the whole crypto world celebrates. Searching “Bitcoin Pizza Day” on Facebook returns a long list of events all over the globe, marking this momentous occasion. Also, some people tweet their own Bitcoin pizzas, like Huobi, a cryptocurrency exchange, did. Of course, we’d wager that these are worth significantly less than USD 80 million, but they sport the Bitcoin logo, so it’s close enough. Across #HUOBI offices in the 🌏, we celebrate with bitcoiners the anniversary of the MOST expensive pizzas in history 🍕2 Papa John's pizzas for 10,000 BTC on 22nd May 2010.Watch what's #BitcoinPizzaDay at https://t.co/hvCleQJOTD#BTCPizzaDay #BitcoinPizza #Bitcoin #BTC pic.twitter.com/QPcTYdPoY6 Some companies are using this day to introduce and advertise new products. Ledger, a cryptocurrency hardware wallet producer, announced that it has ""designed a limited edition of our Nano S [wallet] to celebrate Laszlo's historic moment."" Others tell you, “Don’t be so hard on yourself the next time you make a bad purchase!” In either case, you can look at it from another point of view as well: as Twitter user @marckenigsberg would put it, “8 years later and the price is exactly the same - 10,000 btc. It's just fiat that's devalued.” But don’t forget about the altcoins either. Ethereum community in Berlin, ETHBerlin is celebrating Döner Kebab ETHBerlin day, presumably not to be outdone by a pizza.

" Bitcoin buyers struggled to gain traction above the USD 8,500 resistance, resulting in a downward reaction. However, declines in BTC/USD were contained and it seems like the price is currently consolidating above the USD 8,200 support. There are a few negative signs emerging on charts, but none of them are convincing. This indicates that there could be more ranging moves before bitcoin buyers’ jump into action.  Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently down 2.3% to USD 8,315 (GMT 9:00 AM), with an immediate support at USD 8,250. However, the most important support sits near USD 8,200. Should buyers fail to keep the price above the USD 8,200 support, BTC/USD could tumble below USD 8,000. 
To the topside, an initial resistance is near USD 8,400. To gain upside momentum, the price has to move above USD 8,500, which is a key pivot zone.  Ethereum
Ethereum price failed to stay above the USD 710 and USD 700 support levels. ETH/USD is down roughly 2.5% and is currently trading near USD 694. A close above the USD 700 resistance is required for a decent bounce towards the next resistance at USD 720.
On the downside, the USD 680 is a short-term range support. A break below this may perhaps clear the path for ETH sellers to take control. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price once again declined below USD 1,200 and is currently down 5.5%. It seems like BCH/USD is trading in a broad range of USD 1,150 - USD 1,240. A proper daily close above USD 1,240 and 1,250 is needed for further gains towards USD 1,300.
Ripple is struggling to move above the USD 0.70 barrier. XRP/USD is currently down 3.7% to USD 0.672, with an immediate support at USD 0.665. On the upside, resistances are at USD 0.68 and USD 0.70. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, many altcoins corrected lower including ONT, bitcoin private, nano, lisk, DGB, golem, litecoin, tron and veChain. It seems like the current market sentiment is slightly bearish, suggesting chances of more downsides in the short term. However, if bitcoin price stays above USD 8,200 and buyers succeed in pushing the price above USD 8,500, the market could turn green once again.",2018-05-22
" This past week, we saw a bearish reaction in bitcoin and altcoins. BTC/USD broke the USD 8,500 and USD 8,250 support levels and moved towards USD 8,000. However, downsides were limited and bitcoin price consolidated above USD 8,000 to stage a solid recovery. It bounced back and moved above the broken USD 8,250 support level. Other major cryptocurrencies followed bitcoin and gained bullish traction. Going forward, if bitcoin breaks the USD 8,700 resistance, prices may continue to move higher. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently up roughly 2.5% at USD 8,520 (GMT 9:10 AM) and is showing positive signs. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 8,550. However, weekly hurdles for buyers are at USD 8,700 and USD 9,000. Above this last, BTC/USD may well zoom towards the USD 10,000 resistance.
On the downside, an initial support is at USD 8,250, which is also a pivot level. Should there be a break below USD 8,250, the price may accelerate declines towards the next weekly supports at USD 8,000 and USD 7,600. Ethereum
Ethereum formed a strong base near USD 650 and started an upward move. ETH/USD climbed higher and moved above the USD 680 and USD 700 resistance levels, opening the doors for more upsides.
The pair is currently up 1% to USD 718 and it seems like buyers are in control. Resistances on the upside are at USD 725 and USD 738. A push above the last barrier at USD 738 will most likely call for a test of USD 800 this week. Bitcoin Cash and RippleBitcoin cash price declined heavily this past week and almost tested the USD 1,100 level. However, buyers protected losses below USD 1,125 and the price recovered above USD 1,200. BCH/USD is up 3% today to USD 1,270, with weekly resistances at USD 1,300 and USD 1,360.
Ripple declined below the USD 0.70 support this past week, and it is currently still above the stated level. However, the current price action suggests that XRP/USD could break USD 0.70 and rise further towards the next weekly resistances at USD 0.72 and USD 0.75. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, TRON caught the market attention and TRX price climbed around 15% to break the USD 0.08 resistance. It seems like Tron’s mainnet launch on May 31st (GMT +8) is the main driver for the current bullish wave. If the current momentum stays intact, the price may well test the USD 0.10 level. A few other altcoins to watch out this week are XRP, Neo, RChain, DigiByte, WTC, WAN and Loom Network. Overall, the crypto market opened in the green zone this week, and further gains depend on whether bitcoin succeeds in clearing the USD 8,700 hurdle or not.",2018-05-21
" The past few sessions were most bearish as bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies struggled to recover. As a result, there was a bearish reaction and prices dropped sharply. BTC/USD declined below the USD 8,250 support and ETH/USD settled below USD 700. The overall market sentiment is currently negative, and technical indicators are pointing more downsides in the near term.  Bitcoin
Bitcoin price struggled to move above the USD 8,450 and USD 8,500 resistance levels. BTC/USD moved down and broke many supports such as USD 8,300 and USD 8,250. It declined close to USD 7,900 before recovering. 
The price is currently down 1.8% to USD 8,100 (GMT 8:45 AM), with an initial support at USD 8,000. Below this last, the price could retest the recent low of USD 7,910 and it might even break USD 7,900. On the upside, resistances are seen near USD 8,250 and USD 8,300. A break above USD 8,300 will most likely push the price towards the USD 8,500 hurdle. Ethereum
Ethereum declined sharply, settled below the USD 700 support, and traded towards USD 650. ETH/USD found buyers just above USD 650 and started an upside correction.
It is currently down 2.8% to USD 678 and it seems like any further recoveries are likely to face sellers on the topside around USD 690 and USD 700. On the downside, supports are at USD 660, USD 655 and USD 650. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash trimmed most of its gains and declined by more than 6% to USD 1,200. BCH/USD is currently at a risk of more losses below USD 1,200. The next support is at USD 1,150 - USD 1,160. On the upside, resistances are at USD 1,220, USD 1,240 and USD 1,250.
Ripple traded towards USD 0.65 and is currently down 3%. XRP/USD is finding it really hard to attract buyers and it remains at a risk of more losses below USD 0.65. Other Altcoins Market Today
Almost all small cap coins traded in the red zone today, except Syscoin. SYS coin price gained by more than 15% to move above the USD 0.40 resistance. Syscoin was added to the masternodes.online platform, which was the main driving force for the current upside.
To sum up, the crypto market is likely to end the week on a negative note unless bitcoin price jumps and trades above the USD 8,500 resistance.",2018-05-18
" The Consensus 2018, the largest conference in the crypto world, ended yesterday and many investors and traders are disappointed. Many experts estimated that the conference in New York could spark a much needed rally in bitcoin. However, there was no major upward move in bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies.  According to Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, the prior Consensus rallies have yielded gains between 10% and 70%. Before the conference, he expected the Consensus rally to be even larger this year as ""attendance this year is up dramatically and it’s coming at a time when Bitcoin/Crypto is down YTD [year-to-date]."" Instead, bitcoin, ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash were seen trading with a negative bias. A few probable reasons for no bullish strength could be lack of volumes, over diversification by investors in small cap coins for quick returns, and low liquidity.  Bitcoin
Bitcoin price corrected higher during the past two sessions, but gains were limited by the USD 8,450 and USD 8,500 resistance levels. BTC/USD is currently trading flat near USD 8,250 (GMT 9:00 AM).
It seems like the price is trading in a broad range between USD 8,200 and USD 8,500. It may continue to consolidate before making the next move either towards USD 9,000 or below USD 8,000. Ethereum
Ethereum seems to be struggling to hold gains above USD 700. ETH/USD traded towards the USD 720 resistance, which prevented gains. It is currently up around 1.6% to USD 698, with an immediate resistance at USD 710 and USD 720. 
A push above USD 720 may well open the gates for a run towards USD 750. On the flip side, a break below USD 690 could ignite a fresh bearish wave towards USD 665. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash was able to stay above the USD 1,200 support and recovered more than 2% to USD 1,280. BCH/USD is currently struggling to move above USD 1,300, which is a major barrier for buyers. On the downside, supports are at USD 1,250 and USD 1,240.
Ripple is still capped near the USD 0.70 resistance. XRP/USD is currently up 2.4% to USD 0.687, but buyers are facing tough challenge near USD 0.70. Above this, the price may move towards USD 0.75. Other Altcoins Market Today
Recently, two altcoins, RLC and VERI gained traction and moved up by 39% and 12% respectively. The altcoin market is currently slightly in the green zone with gains between 2-8%. However, there is clearly a lack of strength and buying sentiment.",2018-05-17
" The past two sessions changed the game for bitcoin and altcoins. Bitcoin price was rejected from the USD 8,750 - USD 8,800 resistance area, resulting in a major bearish move. BTC/USD tumbled by more than USD 500 and tested the USD 8,100 support area. Altcoins market was also dragged lower as most major cryptocurrencies, including ethereum, bitcoin cash, ripple, ADA and neo posted declines between 5%-10%. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price formed a short-term top near USD 8,800 and declined sharply. BTC/USD broke many important support levels, including USD 8,500 to move into a bearish zone. The recent decline was protected by the USD 8,100 support, which acted as a barrier for sellers on many occasions. 
However, it seems like the price may not stay above the stated support for a long time. If buyers fail to hold the USD 8,100 support, bitcoin could decline below USD 8,000. On the other hand, if the price corrects higher, the previous supports at USD 8,400 and USD 8,500 are likely to prevent upsides. Ethereum
Ethereum followed bitcoin’s decline and dropped more than USD 50. More importantly, ETH/USD broke the USD 700 support and traded close to USD 670. The price is currently down 6.1% to USD 685 and it remains at a risk of more losses (GMT 9:00 AM).
An immediate support on the downside is at USD 670. Should there be a break below USD 670, the price may perhaps retest the USD 650 support. On the upside, the price has to move above USD 700 to recover in the short term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash declined sharply and broke the USD 1,300 support. BCH/USD is currently down 12.2% to USD 1,245 with a lot of bearish signs. On the downside, the USD 1,200 support awaits to protect the current decline. Resistances on the upside are at USD 1,280 and USD 1,300.
Ripple trimmed most of its gains and declined below the USD 0.70 support. It is down 8.5% to USD 0.67, with an immediate support at USD 0.65. XRP/USD may correct higher in the short term, but upsides could be capped by USD 0.70. Other Altcoins Market Today
Almost all altcoins registered losses during the past two sessions. A few coins such as Loopring, WAX, GTO, Power Ledger and Zcash remained stable with gains between 2%-8%. The overall market sentiment turned bearish after bitcoin settled below the USD 8,500 support.

" The Seminole County of Florida announced on May 14th that starting this summer they will begin accepting cryptocurrency as payment for various services offered by the county, in an attempt to eliminate high fees and improve payment accuracy and efficiency.  According to the official press release, the payment will include services such as property taxes, driver license and ID card fees, as well as tags and titles, and will be done in either Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash. The Seminole County’s tax collector Joel M. Greenberg adds, “We live in a world where technology has made access to services on demand, with same-day delivery and the expectation of highly efficient customer service and we should expect the same from our government. The aim of my tenure in office is to make our customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st century and one way is the addition of cryptocurrency to our payment options.” The county will employ BitPay’s (a bitcoin payment service provider) services, which will allow them to receive settlement the next business day directly to its bank account in US dollars. The county aims to eliminate risks connected to credit card usage, such as fraud and identity theft, through this service.

The price is currently (GMT 8:45 AM) up around 3.5% and is placed nicely above the USD 8,600 support. It may well resume its uptrend above the USD 8,700 resistance. However, a proper break and close above the USD 9,000 resistance is required for further upsides. On the downside, USD 8,600, USD 8,500 and USD 8,450 are key support levels. Ethereum
Ethereum moved with a lot of bullish strength and surpassed a crucial hurdle at USD 700. It even traded above the USD 720 resistance and is currently up 3% to USD 730.
It seems like ETH/USD is currently consolidating above the USD 700 level and it is preparing for the next leg above USD 750. If ETH buyers succeed in pushing the price above USD 750, the next barrier awaits near USD 780. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is stable above USD 1,400, but it lacks upward momentum. BCH/USD has to stay above the USD 1,400 support, else it could decline towards USD 1,360. On the upside, it is facing resistances near the USD 1,440 and USD 1,460 levels.
Ripple moved back above the USD 0.70 support, which is a positive sign. XRP/USD is up 2% to USD 0.737 and it may continue to move higher towards the USD 0.75 resistance. Supports are at USD 0.72 and USD 0.70.  Other Altcoins Market Today

" This past week, there was a strong downward move in bitcoin, ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin and other major cryptocurrencies. BTC/USD pair even broke the USD 9,000 support and tested the next support at USD 8,250. Later, it formed a base and is currently consolidating losses below USD 9,000.

Bitcoin price is currently (GMT 9:00 AM)  trading flat near USD 8,400, with an immediate support at USD 8,320 followed by the all-important USD 8,250 support. BTC/USD recently traded higher, but it could not surpass a key resistance zone near USD 8,650 - USD 8,700.
The price may continue to trade in a range above USD 8,250 in the short term before the decisive move. There could be two scenarios – first, the price breaks the USD 8,250 support, drops below USD 8,000 and starts a fresh upside wave. Alternatively, the price could move higher and break the USD 8,650 - USD 8,700 resistance.

The pair recovered and is currently up 4.10% to USD 708. It must stay above the USD 700 pivot level to continue moving higher. If buyers fail to keep the price above USD 700, it could retest the USD 650 support during the coming sessions. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash price moved into a bearish zone below USD 1,500 this past week. BCH/USD is currently flirting with the USD 1,400 level and is down roughly 2.2%. It may rise in the short term towards USD 1,440, but a break above USD 1,500 is required for a substantial recovery this week.

" Investment research firm Fundstrat revealed very optimistic predictions yesterday: according to them, by the end of 2019, average price of Bitcoin could reach USD 36,000, with a USD 20,000 - USD 64,000 range. This explosion in price could happen due to crypto mining, as Fundstrat predicts a growth of 350% in hash power (the processing power of the Bitcoin network) through 2019. Sam Doctor, head of data science research at Fundstrat, said in a report that the current path of hash power growth supports the forecast. According to CNBC, during a conference call, Doctor said that the economics of Bitcoin mining likely create a support level for the cryptocurrency, as Bitcoin miners are more likely to hold as the price falls to make up for operating costs, so they sell when the price rises for greater profits: “The primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors.” “The release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex [capital expenditure] as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC price appreciates,” Doctor said. Meanwhile, American technology company Nvidia revealed for the first time how much revenue it generated from sales to miners, and said it expects much smaller figures in the second quarter. According to Bloomberg, Nvidia shares declined as much as 3.8% in extended trading after its earnings were announced. The company adds that crypto miners bought most of their GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), which drove prices up, in turn causing gamers to miss out on the new GeForce GPU.",2018-05-11
" Chinese smartphone giant Huawei has made BTC.com’s Bitcoin wallet app available in its AppGallery, a smartphone marketplace that will come preinstalled on its newest devices – and made available to users of older handsets in “coming months.” Bloomberg quotes Alejandro de la Torre, BTC.com’s vice president of business operations, as saying, “It’s a good opportunity to tap into the Chinese market. The use of cashless payments with apps is very big [in China] and the traditional banking system is lacking, so there’s a good use case for crypto payments to grow there.” The vice president of Huawei’s mobile services, Jaime Gonzalo, said, “From our leadership position in China, the tip of the spear of mobile payments, we expect to see massive growth in global cryptocurrency adoption habits in the near future.” Chinese investors currently have limited access to crytpocurrency apps, as the Google's Play Store is banned in mainland China, and Apple’s App Store is also heavily filtered by the government. Interest in cryptocurrencies remains high in China, despite last year’s initial coin offering (ICO) and exchange platform ban – and mining regulations introduced this year.

The International Organization of Securities Commissions met this week in the Hungarian capital, with cryptocurrencies high on the agenda. In a Facebook post, Timur Khromaev, the chairman of Ukraine’s National Securities and Stock Market Commission, and the head of the Committee on Development Strategy and Economic Analysis of Stock Markets, said he and his international counterparts had been discussing “cryptocurrencies and ICOs,” with “several conclusions already being drawn.” “We have passed the point of no return. Cryptocurrencies’ status […] must be adopted by the law and standardized by [Ukrainian] financial regulators,” Khromaev wrote, noting that he now intends to raise the matter with the central bank’s Financial Stability Council. Khromaev also stated, “International standards are still a way off, so cryptocurrency rules and regulations need to first be developed at the national level.”",2018-05-11
" When you amass a fortune in digital currency, you still have to keep it somewhere. Imagine becoming a Bitcoin billionaire - how would you guard your hoard? In your old apartment? Or in vaults behind guards, reinforced concrete and blast doors? Xapo, a startup founded by Argentine entrepreneur Wences Casares, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.  Xapo's global bitcoin storage network Two Xapo clients say his startup is the home to approximately USD 10 billion in Bitcoin, according to Bloomberg. The company, of course, does not store Bitcoin itself, but rather the private keys of their clients. Inside the Xapo Swiss vault  The cache would amount to around 7% of the global Bitcoin supply, which places the startup above 98% of the US banks by deposit amount. The company has vaults on five continents and guarding it is not an easy desk job where you can watch movies when nothing is happening: Xapo's head of security, Carlos Rienzi, said for Quartz last year that the situation is: “under attack 24/7. This is not a race. It is a chess game. You have to think about the opponent’s next movement. You can never relax.” CoinShares, a crypto investment company, for example, has more than USD 500 million at Xapo, and their CEO Ryan Radloff says, “You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.” As the level of security for smaller-scale wallets, both software and hardware, rises, hackers find themselves unable to apply their usual methods of stealing funds, so they have to resort to more traditional ways: the number of crypto robberies at gunpoint is increasing.",2018-05-10
" In an effort to show prospective Lightning Network users how the experience should look in the not-too-distant future, Lightning Labs, a developer of the network, in a blog post introduced Carol, a new Lightning user, and through her example show their vision and some projects they are working on. The idea of the network is that transacting and settling would be done off-blockchain, so the fees are low and thanks to the implementation of smart contracts for security, the payments can be instant - no waiting time for block confirmation. Also, another important factor is its scalability, which is supposed to make it possible for millions to billions of transactions per second to take place across the network.  Once the initial infrastructure components are complete, a Day in the life of Carol, or a new user of Lightning, would start with installing the Lightning app on her phone. Then Carol sets it up like she would a Bitcoin wallet, writing down a backup seed password that will allow her to retrieve her money should she lose her phone. Then, she sends herself some Bitcoin from an exchange using a QR code from the app. As she waits for the initial deposit to clear, her app is synchronizing with the Neutrino protocol that allows low-power devices, in our case smartphones, to use Bitcoin with a high degree of privacy and security. Afterwards, Autopilot system moves Carol’s money to the Lightning network - another waiting time of about an hour, that happens only the first time. The blog post goes on to explain how she uses her app’s integrated point-of-sale system to buy anything she needs with a transaction fee of less than one cent, to buying “Devout Shoulders” in her favorite video game, all the way to adding new funds from an exchange. The Lightning Network is still away from this future, however. As their goal is simplifying the user experience so that Carol doesn’t need to know about cryptography or game theory to use cryptocurrency, the team is working on various components that will make up the Lightning Network, that they promise to be writing more on.",2018-05-09
" Yesterday, there was a decent upward move in bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. However, buyers failed to gain bullish momentum, resulting in a fresh round of selling. BTC/USD failed to move above the USD 9,600 resistance and declined back towards USD 9,000. Similarly, Ethereum failed to hold the USD 750 support and retested the USD 700-710 support zone. At the outset, both bitcoin and Ethereum are now trading near crucial supports, which must hold to avoid further declines. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently down 2.8% to USD 9,130 (GMT 9:00) and is struggling to move above the USD 9,200 resistance. Above the USD 9,200 resistance, the next immediate resistance is at USD 9,250. An hourly close above USD 9,250 may perhaps decrease the current bearish pressure and the price might recover towards USD 9,500.
On the downside, the USD 9,000 level is a crucial support. Should buyers fail to hold bitcoin price above USD 9,000, there could be another round of heavy selling in the short term. Ethereum
Ethereum trimmed most of its gains and declined by more than 4% to USD 725. ETH/USD just managed to hold the USD 700 support, which is also the last line of defense. 
On the upside, the price is facing hurdles near USD 740. Therefore, a convincing push above USD 740 may open the doors for further upsides towards the USD 760 and USD 780 levels. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash moved below the USD 1,600 support to post more than 7% losses. BCH/USD is currently trading near the USD 1,520 level, with an immediate support at USD 1,500. On the upside, the previous support at USD 1,580 may perhaps act as a resistance.
Ripple declined sharply and broke the USD 0.82 and USD 0.80 support levels. XRP/USD is currently down 6.5% to USD 0.77 and is trading in a bearish zone. The previous supports at USD 0.80 and USD 0.82 will most likely act as hurdles for an upside recovery. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, a few small cap altcoins such as Pundi X, Augur, Nexo, Ethos and ZIL posted more than 10% gains. Other than these, most altcoins struggled and posted losses.  The overall market sentiment is slightly bearish, and if bitcoin price fails to stay above USD 9,000, there could be more declines in the near term.",2018-05-09
" Bill Gates says he would short Bitcoin “if there was an easy way to do it” on CNBC’s Squawk Box and of course the community doesn’t stay silent. Tyler Winklevoss, early Bitcoin investor and co-founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, did not pass up the opportunity to tell him how to do it exactly. “Dear @BillGates there is an easy way to short bitcoin. You can short #XBT, the @CBOE Bitcoin (USD) Futures contract, and put your money where your mouth is!” tweeted the young entrepreneur on Monday afternoon. Futures let traders bet on the price of an asset, in this case Bitcoin, at a point months later. A trader who sells a futures contract in anticipation of a decline in Bitcoin price makes money if the price does drop. Trading to benefit from a decline is known as shorting. The rest of the community spoke out as well. To his “greater fool theory” comment, Reddit user billbacon commented, “At least that’s a step up from tulips,” referencing how analysts often compare Bitcoin to the infamous tulip bubble.  Another user, tldrtldrtldr says that Gates actually shorting Bitcoin may not be a bad thing either: “Shorting is great for true price discovery. By all means he should short it. If Bitcoin has legs it will rise. If it fails, it was a bubble all along. Let the market settle this.”",2018-05-08
" Bitcoin’s fall from almost USD 20,000 is directly tied to the launch of a futures market, according to research from the San Francisco Federal Reserve published on Monday.  “The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence. It is consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the introduction of futures markets for an asset,” four researchers wrote in the bank's most recent Economic Letter. They add that until futures existed it was extremely difficult, if not impossible, to bet on the decline of Bitcoin prices. The cryptocurrency rose more than 1,300% in 2017 as optimistic investors continued to bid up. “The pessimists, however, had no mechanism available to put money behind their belief that the bitcoin price would collapse. So they were left to wait for their “I told you so” moment,” the researchers explain. As for why it was a gradual fall rather than an overnight collapse, researchers said it could be a lack of attention or willingness to enter the market on the first week of trading. Future prices and demand could be helped by any traditional financial institutions becoming more willing to accept Bitcoin, and official recognition and regulatory acceptance of Bitcoin as a means of payments, they wrote. Once speculative demand by optimists and pessimists balances out, the research offers some insights into where the fundamental price of Bitcoin could go. “Given that there is no actual asset that backs the value of Bitcoin [...] what will eventually determine the “fundamental” price of Bitcoin is transactional demand relative to supply,” explains the text. Until then, the price is most likely to remain its old volatile self. Futures contracts, also referred to as futures, are standardized exchange-traded financial derivatives that provide an agreement between a buyer and a seller to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a predefined date. Each futures contract represents a specific amount of the underlying asset and futures can be either cash settled or come with physical delivery. In the case of bitcoin futures, the underlying asset is the digital currency bitcoin.",2018-05-08
" After a substantial downside correction, bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies found support. BTC/USD buyers successfully defended the USD 9,200 support, and ethereum stayed above the USD 700 handle. Later, the crypto market sentiment improved and prices recovered above key resistance levels. Technically, it seems like a correction wave is complete and prices may resume its uptrend. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently trading 0.45% up to USD 9,400 (around GMT 9:00 AM). To gain upside momentum, BTC/USD has to move above the USD 9,600 resistance level. Should buyers succeed in clearing the USD 9,600 resistance, the next stop could be the all-important USD 10,000.
On the flip side, if the price moves down once again, the USD 9,200 support may perhaps prevent losses. Below this the price might test the USD 9,000 level.
In the short-term, the price may trade in a range below USD 9,600 before making the next move. Ethereum
Ethereum bounced back sharply from the USD 700 barrier. ETH/USD traded above the USD 750 resistance and is currently trading 1.78% higher to USD 758. 
The price is facing resistance near the USD 770 level. A successful break above the stated resistance will most likely push the price above USD 800. On the downside, supports are visible near USD 750 and USD 740. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash was well bid around the USD 1,550 support. BCH/USD recovered nicely and moved above the USD 1,600 resistance. On the upside, a break above the USD 1,680 resistance is required for a push towards the USD 1,750 level.
Ripple stayed above the USD 0.82 support and is currently up 1% to USD 0.8320. XRP/USD is facing a tough resistance at USD 0.85, which prevented gains on many occasions earlier. Above USD 0.85, the price could retest the USD 0.90 level. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, Bytecoin got heavily bid after it was listed on one of the major cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. BCN price jumped by more than 100% and traded above USD 0.014.  A few other small cap altcoins such as 0x, ZIL, Ethos, Loom Network, Holo, Pundi X and Cortex gained more than 10% today.

" Following the announcement about opening a Bitcoin trading unit made by Goldman Sachs, some of the biggest names on Wall Street seem to be warming up to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general, The New York Times reports. According to people who wished to remain anonymous due to the plans still being confidential, as well as documents and emails seen by NYT, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been working on an online trading platform for large investors to buy and hold (or HODL) Bitcoin. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE, the parent company of the NY Stock Exchange) and Goldman mark the first foray into the as of yet unregulated world of cryptocurrency. Since details of the ICE platform are still not finalized, there is a chance that the project could fall apart, given the reluctance usually shown by the Wall Street in terms of crypto. The New York Times further reports ICE having had conversations with financial institutions about implementing so-called swaps, which mean banks buying contracts that end with a customer owning Bitcoin the next day, citing people familiar with the matter. Although the swap is slightly more complicated than simply buying crypto for an amount of USD, it would allow the trading to come under the regulation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, operating under existing laws. The possible move would fall in line with the general trend of increasing warmth towards the crypto industry: only recently, the CEO of Nasdaq said the company could become a crypto exchange as well as soon as the industry matures. However, not everyone is as thrilled: Warren Buffett is steadfast on his negative opinion and the only thing that changes is how he expresses his distaste.",2018-05-08
" Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates told CNBC’s Squawk Box program that he would short Bitcoin if there was an easy way to do it. “As an asset class, you're not producing anything and so you shouldn't expect it to go up. It's kind of a pure 'greater fool theory' type of investment,” he said. He apparently used to HODL Bitcoin for a few years, having been gifted a certain amount for his birthday, but that he sold it. He explains, “Bitcoin and ICOs [initial coin offerings], I believe completely [they're some] of the crazier, speculative things.” Of course, he’s not too far off from most negative opinions regarding Bitcoin, and similarly, he believes in blockchain as a technology and can see how it could be implemented. Gates is on the board of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and was speaking from Omaha, Nebraska, where the conglomerate held its annual shareholders meeting over the weekend. Interestingly, it was only recently that Buffett called Bitcoin “rat poison,” while cryptocurrency enthusiasts gathered on the social media website Reddit to pitch the idea that his opinion probably stems from fear, due to most of his fortune coming out of more traditional venues. This is also not the first time Gates has offered his negative opinion on crypto: his past foray into crypto-commenting was deemed unimaginative and uninformed, as he had gone for the old adage that crypto is only used by criminals.",2018-05-07
" This past week, there was a solid bullish trend established in bitcoin and altcoins. BTC/USD traded above the USD 9,500 resistance and even broke the USD 10,000 level. However, buyers could not hold the momentum above the USD 10,000 level, resulting in a downside reaction. At the outset, the current price action suggests that buyers are losing grip. Therefore, there could be more declines in bitcoin and altcoins before the start of a fresh upside wave. Bitcoin
Today’s technical indicators are pointing a bearish price action in Bitcoin. BTC/USD has trimmed more than USD 500 and is currently trading near USD 9,400 (GMT 9:00 AM). On the upside, resistances are at USD 9,500 and USD 9,600.
A successful close above the USD 9,600 resistance may perhaps push the price towards the all-important USD 10,000. Finally, a proper close above USD 10,000 is a must for bullish continuation.
On the downside, the previous resistance near USD 9,250 is a key support. If the price fails to hold the USD 9,250 support, there could be more losses. Weekly supports below USD 9,250 are USD 9,000 and 8,450. Ethereum
Ethereum trimmed more than 10% of its last week gains. ETH/USD declined from well above USD 830 to USD 730. At present, the price is down 4.9% to USD 740 with bearish signs. Weekly supports on the downside are at USD 720 and USD 700. 
On the flip side, if the price moves higher, it could face sellers near USD 760. Above this last, the main weekly resistances are at USD 800 and USD 830. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash declined more than USD 200 from the USD 1,850 high. BCH/USD is currently under a bearish pressure and is trading above the USD 1,600 support. A break below the USD 1,600 support may perhaps push the price towards USD 1,500.
Ripple trimmed most of its last week gains and settled below USD 0.90 and USD 0.85. XRP/USD is now approaching the USD 0.80 support where buyers are likely to appear.  Other Altcoins Market Today
Most small cap altcoins enjoyed solid gains this past week. However, it seems like they are losing momentum and are at risk of more declines. Today’s best performer is BitcoinDark, which surged by more than 40% and traded towards USD 175.

" After an investor and one of the richest man in the world Warren Buffett once again offered his ever-constant insight into crypto, this time calling Bitcoin “probably rat poison squared,” theories abound on why he is so dead-set on proving to the world that crypto is evil personified. The time, the Oracle of Omaha was speaking at the annual Berkshire Hathaway, an American multinational conglomerate holding company, run by Buffett, shareholder meeting on Saturday. One of the theories that seems to hold most merit is that Buffett’s obvious distaste for all things related to cryptocurrency is based in fear: among Berkshire Hathaway's biggest holdings are traditional financial institutions such as Wells Fargo (the largest by far), Goldman Sachs or Bank of New York Mellon. As the Redditor et-nad who first pointed this out puts it, “His firm will collapse if he started supporting crypto. Not surprised.” Buffett’s words should not be taken as scripture in the cryptoverse, and his support, or lack thereof, is not hindering the adoption of crypto all that much, according to other Redditors who had joined the discussion. “Buffet likes slow, steady, stable, proven industries that produce small but consistent returns. Crypto definitely doesn't fit into any of the above categories,” says one. Another points out that his loud hatred is perhaps unwarranted: “I like red sauce pasta. It doesn't mean I should go bashing white sauce pasta,” comparing it to Buffett’s general reactions. Another replied, “Go take your reasonable, well-adjusted outlook on life elsewhere. Your kind isn't welcomed here.” Buffett has a history of being wrong about new technologies: only recently, he admitted he was wrong about both Google and Amazon, having expressed his disbelief in the companies when they first emerged. In either case, Berkshire Hathaway keeps growing. Its revenues stood at USD 242 billion last year, or 8% more than in 2016. While it assets increased by 13%, to USD 702.1 billion, in the same period, according to the annual report of the company.",2018-05-07
" After announcing their intent to file a lawsuit for fraud against Bitcoin.com for labeling Bitcoin Cash “Bitcoin” and the real Bitcoin “Bitcoin Core,” the pro-BTC community has reversed this plan on their Telegram channel on May 3rd, citing lack of funds. However, Bitcoin.com has since corrected their mistake, adding the “Cash” part to BCH, while still naming BTC as ""Bitcoin Core"". Twitter user MoneyTrigz, who originally launched the idea of the lawsuit, tweeted, “We appreciate the 31 people that donated to the initiative. But USD 3,700 won't be enough to do much, so we decided to cancel the initiative and refund the 31 transactions (total 0.39BTC). I’m happy were able to at least get bitcoin.com make 90% changes on its fraud and disinformation.” Charlie Lee, founder of Litecoin cryptocurrency, called the lawsuit “stupid” at first, but retracted his statement in a tweet, saying that the lawsuit has obviously “done some good” by making Roger Ver, the creator of bitcoin.com, correct the erroneous claims made on his website. The group’s response to the decision to pull the lawsuit has been largely positive, with one user saying it was “the first time Roger [Ver] scaled back on his fraudulent practices.” The civil war between BTC and BCH will presumably keep raging, although it often boils down to fans of both picking petty fights. However, this move should not be seen as a loss for BCH: if anything, it is a help to crypto rookies to not make mistakes because of Bitcoin confusion. As a certain videogame would say, “War. War never changes.”",2018-05-04
" Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies traded higher during the past few sessions and registered solid gains. BTC/USD cleared a major resistance at USD 9,500 to move further in the bullish zone. Similarly, Ethereum cleared the USD 780 - USD 800 barrier to register more than 10% gains. Overall, the current technical structure is bullish, which could result in more upsides in bitcoin and altcoins. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is rising steadily and is up around 6.4% to USD 9,820 (~GMT 9:00 AM). BTC/USD settled above a major resistance at USD 9,500, opening the doors for a test of USD 10,000. Should buyers succeed in clearing the USD 10,000 hurdle, the price could accelerate gains in the near term. The next resistance is close to the USD 10,800 level.
If there is a correction from the current or higher levels, the previous resistance at USD 9,500 is likely to act as a support. Below the stated USD 9,500, the next major support is at USD 9,200. Ethereum
Ethereum gained more than 10% today and is currently flirting with the USD 800 resistance. A successful close above the stated resistance may perhaps call for further upsides towards the USD 840 level.
On the downside, there are many support for ETH/USD, starting with USD 780 and up to USD 750. The pair remains well supported on dips and it seems like buyers are in control above USD 780. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is struggling to catch up and is currently up around 2.8% to USD 1,520. BCH/USD broke the USD 1,500 resistance, which is a positive sign. However, the price has to gain momentum to continue towards USD 1,540. On the downside, the USD 1,500 and USD 1,480 are support levels.

" A Wednesday panel at the Milken Institute Global Conference was billed as a sober discussion to a ballroom where every seat was filled, but soon turned to shouting, crosstalk and what seems like the perfect opportunity to see it as a superhero vs supervillain fight a la Marvel. Nouriel Roubini is the famously bearish New York University economist, who predicted the 2008 financial crisis which earned him the nickname Dr Doom. He called Bitcoin fanatics as “suckers” and said repeatedly that its underlying technology was “bulls**t,” Bloomberg reported. In his opinion, the blockchain is a “glorified Excel spreadsheet” since “cryptocurrency holders still go through centralized exchanges to clear their transactions.” Alex Mashinsky, a blockchain entrepreneur, told him, “Everything you just said is irrelevant.” Voicing the general confusion, Bill Barhydt, who worked on cryptography for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) said, “I don’t even know where to begin.” Mashinsky stepped up to the Captain Crypto role to defend the valiant cryptoverse, saying crypto assets will let people bypass banks, to which Dr Doom replied, “You’re just making stuff up.” It would seem Dr Doom was not informed that sticking your fingers in your ears and shouting lalala does not change reality when you’re above six years old. Mashinsky wasn’t backing down. “Why don’t you buy one coin, then you can tell us how it works,” he slammed the “evil” Dr Doom down. According to New York Post, Barhydt said of Roubini that this is, “like a horse salesman saying we don’t need combustion engines.” Although many in the crypto space may seem younglings compared to all panelists, we feel compelled to tell you: this is not how grownups talk.

" Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs is moving ahead with plans to set up the first Bitcoin trading operation at a Wall Street bank, The New York Times reported. While the exact launch date of the new trading operation is not yet set, the move came after the bank's board of directors signed off on the initiative. Although Goldman will not immediately be buying and selling Bitcoin, a team at the bank is reported to be willing to go into that direction following regulatory approval, as well as having a plan on how to deal with the associated risks. One of the Goldman executives overseeing the creation of the trading operation, Rana Yared, said the decision resulted from a growing number of inquiries from clients who expressed their interest in holding (or HODLing) Bitcoin. “It resonates with us when a client says, ‘I want to hold Bitcoin or Bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate store of value,’” she told the Times. She adds that Goldman had concluded that Bitcoin is not a fraud and does not have the characteristics of a currency. They also intend on creating their own future, described as more flexible, known as a non-deliverable forward, which they will offer to clients. They have also hired their own first “digital asset” trader, Justin Schmidt, to handle the daily operation. Schmidt previously worked as a trader at hedge fund Seven Eight Capital before leaving last year to trade cryptocurrencies.

" The crypto market has recovered slowly and steady during the past five weeks. Bitcoin price broke the USD 8,000 and USD 8,500 resistance levels to settle above USD 9,000. However, volatility dipped sharply during the past few months. Per Bloomberg, Bitcoin’s daily trading range fell from USD 4,700 in December 2017 to USD 124 in April 2018. Such narrow ranges were seen during mid-2017 before BTC/USD jumped from USD 2,000 towards USD 20,000. The current technical structure, narrow range trading, candlestick patterns on the daily chart and multiple rejection patterns from the lows indicates that bitcoin price is heading towards a major break. It could surge higher if buyers succeed in pushing the price above the USD 10,000 resistance level. Therefore, the next few weeks may perhaps play a crucial role. Bitcoin
Considering intraday price action, bitcoin price was successful in surpassing the USD 9,250 resistance. It has opened the doors for more gains, which means BTC/USD could accelerate higher towards USD 9,500 and USD 9,600 during the following sessions.
On the downside, supports are seen at USD 9,100, USD 9,050 and USD 9,000. Any further declines could be limited considering the current positive bias. Ethereum
Ethereum once again performed well and broke the USD 700 resistance. ETH/USD traded to a new monthly high above USD 730, and it seems like the pair is likely to continue its upside move.
If there is a downside correction, the broken resistance levels at USD 700 and USD 690 are likely to act as supports in the near term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash broke a crucial resistance at USD 1,400, which opened the doors for a push above USD 1,500. BCH/USD traded as high as USD 1,540 today before correcting to USD 1,480. On the downside, supports are at USD 1,450 and USD 1,400.

Bitcoin price recovered and traded above the USD 9,000 pivot level. BTC/USD is currently trading 0.5% up to USD 9,090 and it seems like the price may accelerate higher. 
On the upside, there are two important resistances – USD 9,200 and USD 9,250. A close above the USD 9,250 resistance could open the doors for a push towards the USD 9,500 level in the near term.
If there is a downside correction, the price may find bids near USD 9,000, followed by the USD 8,800 swing low. Ethereum
Ethereum performed really well and recovered above the USD 650 and USD 670 resistance levels. More importantly, the ETH/USD pair formed a solid bullish pattern on the daily chart, signaling a rejection from the USD 625 level.
On the upside, the price is facing resistance near USD 680. Should the price clear the stated USD 780, it could accelerate above the USD 700 level.  Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is up around 2.1% to USD 1,352. BCH/USD is showing positive signs above the USD 1,320 support, but it has to break the USD 1,380 and USD 1,400 resistance levels to remain in a positive zone. A proper close above USD 1,400 may perhaps push the price towards USD 1,500.

" The Bitcoin (BTC)-supporting community from the everlasting war between BTC and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is furious because they claim that sites like bitcoin.com are misleading buyers into purchasing BCH instead of Bitcoin. The problem lies in the site using the name Bitcoin for BCH and Bitcoin Core for BTC. The outraged users have now launched a site, bitcoincomlawsuit.info, which will soon be accepting Bitcoin donations in support of leveling a promised lawsuit against Bitcoin.com. Blurring the distinction between BCH and BTC has caused people to purchase BCH instead of BTC like they wanted, users claim, calling this a “fraud” and naming that as the basis for the lawsuit. Notably, the creator of bitcoin.com is Roger Ver, a long-standing proponent of Bitcoin Cash, who is well-known and often controversial for his stance that Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin. As previously written in our short primer on this war, some skeptics see this battle as a harbinger of the 'crash' that everyone who has not bought into crypto yet is waiting for. This war, shortly summarized as Roger Ver against the world, is nothing new: a while ago, he offered social media site Reddit USD 100,000 if they appoint a new moderator to the popular subreddit r/Bitcoin “who supports free speech.” But as a user pointed out, “Speech isn’t free if you pay USD 100,000 for it.” His antics have even forced Erik Voorhees, CEO of ShapeShift, a digital assets trading company, to come forward with his opinion on this feud, tweeting: Roger - please stop referencing me to back up your opinion that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. It isn't. Bitcoin is the chain originating from the genesis block with the highest accumulated proof of work. The Bitcoin Cash fork failed to gain majority, thus it is not Bitcoin.",2018-04-30
" Several analysts have predicted widespread cryptocurrency market volatility after Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee of defunct exchange Mt. Gox, moved BTC 16,000 (USD 147m) and a similar amount in Bitcoin Cash to an unknown address. Should Mt. Gox trustees move to sell more of the company’s huge cryptocurrency holdings, markets everywhere could be in for a tumultuous end to the week. Last time Mt. Gox sold some USD 400-500 million in Bitcoin, to cover the exchange’s yen debts, trustees were criticized as markets in multiple currencies nosedived. News outlet The Next Web quotes cryptocurrency analyst Ivo Jonkers as saying, “It appears that the Mt. Gox trustees have moved the funds to a wallet belonging to an exchange desk. The last time this happened, Mt. Gox proceeded to sell the funds at market rate, practically sending the entire market in the red. I wouldn't be surprised if this happens again.” South Korean media outlet Blockinpress claims it is “highly likely that [Kobayashi] will seek to sell the currency through exchanges with over-the-counter (OTC) transactions.” A court ruling that would appear to preventing the further sale of Mt. Gox’s crypto assets until September this year is in place, but it is unclear as to whether this would actually prevent Kobayashi from making a sale. Kobayashi claimed in March that the trustee’s previous asset sales have been measured, saying, “Following consultation with cryptocurrency experts, I sold BTC and Bitcoin Cash, not in an ordinary sale through a BTC or BCH exchange, but in a manner that would avoid affecting the market price, while ensuring the security of the transaction to the [greatest possible extent].”",2018-04-27
" ""Spirits told me,"" joked Tim Draper, famous early investor in groundbreaking projects such as the internet, Tesla, Skype and Hotmail among others, answering to a question about his recent bitcoin price forecast.  He was on a Skype call with participants of Crypto Capital World, a crypto investments conference, currently taking place in Vilnius, Lithuania. Earlier in April, Draper estimated that bitcoin will hit USD 250,000 within four years. Now he explained why.  According to the investor, there are trillions of US dollars worth of fiat currencies and in a few years cryptocurrency share will reach at least 20%, while bitcoin's share of the crypto universe's market value will stand at 20%-25%. Also, Draper added that the ""greatest engineers"" are now working on cryptocurrencies, while ""not many engineers"" are working on improvements of US Dollar or Japanese Yen. In 2014, he correctly predicted that bitcoin would pass USD 10,000 mark in 2017. Now the investor explains that back then he estimated that bitcoin would become recognizable by many people, while growing number of available trading platforms would encourage newcomers to buy bitcoin. “This [Bitcoin] is bigger than the internet. It's bigger than the Iron Age, the Renaissance. It's bigger than the Industrial Revolution. This affects the entire world and it's going to be affected in a faster and more prevalent way than you ever imagined,” Draper stated earlier this week and repeated his previous forecast that “In five years you are going to try to go buy coffee with fiat currency and they are going to laugh at you because you're not using crypto."" Meanwhile, Draper is not only one giving bold price target for Bitcoin. This week, John Pfeffer, a partner at Pfeffer Capital, put 1% odds that bitcoin price will reach USD 700,000. However, Pfeffer did not elaborate, when it may happen. The forecast is based on an idea that Bitcoin may become ""the dominant non-sovereign store of value, it could be the new gold, or new reserve currency"". ***

" After the local power grid operator reported abnormal electricity usage in the north China city of Tianjin, police confiscated a total of 600 computers used to mine cryptocurrency, Xinhua news agency reported. Quoting the local police, Xinhua said that eight high-power fans were seized as well, and that this was the “largest power theft case in recent years.” The report does not note the time that the confiscation took place. The power company monitored sudden increases in line loss on one electricity line, up to 28% at the peak. The phenomenon is usually closely related with increased load current. An investigation found that the junction box of the suspected power user’s electricity meter had been short-circuited - a typical way to avoid billing. This follows China’s many regulatory crackdowns on crypto in general, from banning initial coin offerings to closing down all exchanges in the country, which led to many startups moving abroad to be able to raise funds and people finding new and more dangerous ways of obtaining cryptocurrency, such as using “crypto mules.”  After China closed their crypto exchanges for good, an underground system of “mules” and peer-to-peer networks sprung up to fill in the void left by the strict measures against them. An underground trader would buy cryptocurrencies in other markets and sell them at a premium to investors in China, who are ready to pay more since they have no other choice.  When January saw the height of demand after the sky-high prices of December, underground traders were able to sell Bitcoin for 30% to 40% more than its price elsewhere.",2018-04-25
" Nine years after Satoshi Nakamoto came up with Bitcoin, it is by far the biggest cryptocurrency we have. But since success breeds competition, Bitcoin could well be made redundant by copycats in three scenarios brought to us by TechnologyReview. The first option would be a government takeover. Not too unlikely to happen, given that many government officials, especially in the West, recognize the merits of the blockchain technology, but are wary of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to their decentralized and pseudonymous nature.  This option was described by David Andolfatto, a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and later refined by Sahil Gupta, an undergraduate at Yale University. Gupta created a system where everything works just like Bitcoin does, except the ledger is managed by institutions certified by the Federal Reserve.  Option two would be Facebook pulling a Telegram. Just like Telegram, a messaging app, that is trying to make its own coin that users could send each other or use to pay for services within the network and raised USD 1.7 billion in its pre-ICO, the same thing could happen with Facebook, given that they claim to have around two billion active users around the globe. They wouldn’t even have to make a new coin: they could just fork Bitcoin into a corporate version - or take it over completely. According to TechnologyReview, this would include building a user-friendly Facebook-hosted Bitcoin wallet, integrating it into every profile on the platform, and voila: the whole wallet-alphanumeric-string thing would be much less confusing to your average Joe. They could let users watch ads or write posts to earn coins, or even let the platform mine on their computers. After having 2.2 billion users hooked onto Bitcoin through their own platform, seizing it and making it centralized would only be a step away. Option three is quaintly named: go forth and multiply, in light of what’s already happening. There would be coins for everything, from specific services to groceries, even coins that are exclusive to stores. “My vision of the future is that there would be thousands if not millions of ways to pay for stuff,” Campbell Harvey, a professor of finance at Duke University, was quoted as saying. This is not a new idea: for example, Kodak announced a KodakCOIN, that people could use to license the rights to their photography on their platform. Although evocative of gift cards and coupons, blockchain would now make them easily and securely transferable. In the article by TechnologyReview Harvey suggests to think of this as a barter system: “If you have a network and you tokenize the goods and services and enable it with a blockchain, it can become very efficient.” This would then include moving tokens from one chain to another - an idea similar to exchanging fiat from one currency to another when traveling to another country. A broker would facilitate these exchanges and help you find the coin you need, in exchange for one you already have. The seven billion people not yet using Bitcoin might not care about the freedom of Bitcoin. As TechnologyReview puts it, convenience would always win: “If cryptocurrencies are to be widely used, it will be the habits of the masses, not the wishes of Bitcoin’s early adopters, that determine what becomes of Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision.”",2018-04-24
" Tim Draper, famous early investor in groundbreaking projects such as the internet, Tesla, Skype and Hotmail among others, remains a fan of Bitcoin. He reiterated his bullish call for bitcoin to hit USD 250,000 within four years at Intelligence Squared U.S. debate presented in partnership with Manhattan Institute's Adam Smith Society on Saturday. When asked how Bitcoin compares with his other famous investments, he said, “This is bigger than the internet. It's bigger than the Iron Age, the Renaissance. It's bigger than the Industrial Revolution. This affects the entire world and it's going to be affected in a faster and more prevalent way than you ever imagined.” “In five years you are going to try to go buy coffee with fiat currency and they are going to laugh at you because you're not using crypto. I believe that there will be a point at which you will no longer really want any of the fiat currency,” he repeated his previous forecast. But the debate didn’t go completely in the favor of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Most of the other participants echoed the old story of anonymous and pseudonymous cryptocurrencies being attractive only to criminals, and expressed their disbelief in a decentralized system. In spite of Draper’s vivacious and to the point approach, the debate ended with 68% of the votes going towards those who think that Bitcoin is a bubble and not really here to stay. In comparison, in the pre-debate vote, Bitcoin believers actually made up the majority, but it would seem that they were swayed by the arguments of the opposing faction.",2018-04-24
" There was a decent uptrend initiated this past week as bitcoin gained traction and moved above a major resistance at USD 8,300. Other major cryptocurrencies also gained bullish momentum, but bitcoin cash outperformed ethereum, ripple, bitcoin, ADA and EOS. Other altcoins (small cap) remained in the green zone and the market sentiment is likely to improve further this week. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price jumped recently and moved above the USD 8,300 and USD 8,500 resistance levels. BTC/USD even spiked above USD 9,000 and traded as high as USD 9,020 before starting a downside correction.
The price is currently trading flat near the USD 8,920 level, with resistances on the upside at USD 8,980 and USD 9,000. A successful close above this could open the doors for a push towards the next major pivot level at USD 10,000.
On the downside, weekly supports are at USD 8,800, USD 8,500 and USD 8,250. A push below the USD 8,250 support may clear the path for an extended correction towards USD 7,500. Ethereum
Ethereum settled above the USD 600 level. ETH/USD traded as high as USD 643 and it currently trading 3.2% higher. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 650. A successful break above USD 650 may perhaps call for a test of USD 700.
On the downside, supports are at USD 600 and USD 580. A daily close below USD 580 might ignite a trend reversal in the near term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash enjoyed an amazing week and traded above the USD 1,000 level. BCH/USD opened this week on a much better note and traded above USD 1,400. It is currently trading 19% higher to USD 1,391. Resistances are at USD 1,450 and USD 1,500.
Ripple is stable above the USD 0.85 level. It seems like XRP/USD is facing a strong resistance near 0.90. Therefore, once there is a close above USD 0.90, the price may reach USD 1.00. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, Bytom, Golem and VERI climbed by more than 20% and traded with a lot of strength. The current market sentiment is very positive, suggesting more gains in altcoins this week. To sum up, this could be another green week. However, it would be interesting to see how bitcoin price reacts if it reaches the USD 10,000 barrier.",2018-04-23
" With all manner of mining-related costs rising and crypto prices not recovering from their slump following December 2017, mining profitability is often brought into question. Morgan Stanley, an American investment bank, analysts say that if Bitcoin can't recover USD 8,600 soon, miners will likely find it unprofitable to keep creating the cryptocurrency. In a note on Thursday, equity analyst Charlie Chan and his team told CNBC, “We estimate the break-even point for big mining pools should be USD 8,600, even if we assume a very low electricity cost (USD 0.03 kW/h).” Companies selling mining chips are better off, as the Morgan Stanley model estimates an asic (application-specific integrated circuit) would break even over two years if Bitcoin traded near USD 5,000. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC, is not so sure. Morgan Stanley estimates that about 10% of TSMC revenue now depends on cryptocurrency mining demand. The company has already been forced to cut its revenue forecast from 10%-15% to only 10%, “due to the smartphone weakness and the uncertainty in cryptocurrency mining demand.” Meanwhile, some people have decided to sell their mining rigs and are tweeting offers - but not for this reason. As economist and investor Tuur Demeester points out in a tweet, profitability has dropped, but the original seller in this case disagrees - he’s only selling because his hosting contract hasn’t been renewed.  Yet still as profitable as they were when I originally invested in them...months before profitability exceeded my wildest dreams.  I’m selling because my hosting contract isn’t being renewed. In a Bloomberg tweet, the discussion turns even more interesting. “It’s self-stabilizing,” claims one side of the debate - the majority, really - accusing the news outlet of spreading FUD and bad journalism. Even with the price back above $8,000Even with the price back above $9,000Even with the price back above $10,000Even with the price back above $15,000Even with the price back above $20,000Even with the price back above $30,000Same thing will be said again & again In the end, the decision whether to stop mining comes down to the miners themselves and the question of whether profitability is coming down will resolve itself.",2018-04-20
" Yesterday, we discussed about a possible bullish breakout in bitcoin above the USD 8,250 resistance. The price did move higher and cleared the USD 8,250 and USD 8,300 resistance levels. It boosted the market sentiment and many cryptocurrencies extended gains, including ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin, Neo, ADA and QTUM. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price traded as high as USD 8,398 recently before correcting lower. BTC/USD is currently (GMT 9:30 AM) up 1.45% to USD 8,300, with an immediate support on the downside at USD 8,250, followed by the USD 8,200 pivot level. 
On the upside, the price may perhaps face resistance near USD 8,360 - USD 8,380. If buyers succeed in pushing the price above USD 8,380, there could be an upward acceleration towards the USD 8,500 level. 
The technical structure is bullish above the USD 8,000 support, and there are chances of further upsides in the near term. Ethereum
Ethereum extended gains above the USD 540 and USD 550 resistance levels. ETH/USD traded towards the USD 590 level before correcting lower. It is currently trading 7.5% higher from the USD 530 low.
On the upside, there are many hurdles below the USD 600 level, starting with USD 580. On the downside, supports are at USD 550 and USD 540. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash continued to outperform most major cryptocurrencies. It is currently trading 9.7% higher to USD 975. Recently, it traded close to the USD 1,000 level before it faced a strong selling interest. BCH/USD remains in a bullish zone, but an upward break above the USD 1,000 resistance won’t be easy.
Ripple blasted higher today and broke many resistances such as USD 0.75, USD 0.80 and USD 0.85. XRP/USD is now in a solid uptrend and it could continue to move higher towards the USD 1.00 level. On the downside, supports are at USD 0.80 and USD 0.78. Other Altcoins Market Today
Almost all altcoins are trading in the green zone. It seems like the crypto market is poised to extend gains since the total market cap is now above the USD 350 billion. The next target for buyer could the USD 500 billion. Overall, there are many bullish signs, but traders should not discard possibilities of a short-term correction from the current or a bit higher levels.",2018-04-20
" Passionate and somewhat controversial Bitcoin Cash supporter Roger Ver is stirring the proverbial pot once again through his Twitter account. This time, he is offering USD 100,000 to Reddit, a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website, if they appoint a new moderator to the popular subreddit r/Bitcoin. Ver, who owns Bitcoin.com and has signed on to the “Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin” movement, is now calling Reddit out for not being “a profitable company” lately, and is offering to help them out of this predicament by paying them USD 100,000 if they “simply appoint a moderator to /r/Bitcoin who supports free speech.”  The two most popular subreddits dedicated to Bitcoin are r/Bitcoin and r/BTC, and the two are in a tense relationship that’s only been worsening over the years. r/Bitcoin has often been accused of censorship its moderation of posts related to the years-long Bitcoin scaling debate. r/BTC, however, is more of a Bitcoin Cash subreddit, regardless of the name - and Roger Ver himself is one of the moderators.  Although Ver has his number of supporters cheering him on in the replies to his tweet, some of the answers, especially the contrary ones, are genuinely funny. For example, one user replied: Speech isn't free if you pay $100k for it :) Others have gone much further. A user tweeted: I really like dogs. I will pay @reddit $100,000 to appoint a dog-friendly moderator on r/cats. Dogs are the real cats. This unjust censorship has gone on too long! BABIES R DYIIIINNNNGGGG!!!! But of course, Reddit does not really need the money. Last year, the company raised USD 200 million in funding, placing its total valuation at USD 1.8 billion.",2018-04-20
" Mark Karpeles, ex-CEO of the Mt. Gox exchange and often vying for the spot of least favorite person in the crypto community, has found that it’s not very easy to find and/or keep a job when you’re considered a villain after losing 850,000 Bitcoins. Although 200,000 of those Bitcoins ended up surfacing somehow and the rest is believed to be stolen by hackers, this didn’t help Karpeles with the fact that he’s still in the middle of a lawsuit for charges of embezzlement, manipulation of electronic data, and breach of trust. Job prospects would seem grim for anyone else. However, Karpeles’s LinkedIn profile now lists the position of new chief technology officer of London Trust Media, a Denver-based company that boasts the world’s largest paid virtual private network (VPN) service and is investing in cryptocurrency projects. Karpeles confirmed this to Fortune in a written message, after a bit of nudging. His new employer hasn’t been so shy with broadcasting the news. Andrew Lee, co-founder, chairman and chief of lab division at London Trust Media, said for Fortune, “Mark fought and fell. And although he fell, his skills, experience and know-how unarguably continue to exist. <...> I am more than willing to give a second chance to Mark in this fight’s critical hour.” Lee doesn’t mind Karpeles’s past. “I wouldn’t dare say that the person who architected the Titanic should never again architect another ship,” he said. How this will turn out remains to be seen, although Karpeles is only too happy to wash his hands of crypto, citing his lack of belief in the purpose of Bitcoin.  Given that Mt. Gox was created as an exchange for Magic: The Gathering Online card game players, perhaps Karpeles’s problem with Bitcoin is that it exceeded this purpose.",2018-04-19
" If you’re not much of a chart analyst and really just look at the Bitcoin price and maybe at its percentage of change within the past 24 hours, you probably haven’t heard of the Vomiting Camel. It’s actually a thing in the stock market, too. Best of all, it’s a joke that’s gone too far. Some chart analysts like to find pictures in charts that remind them of something, presumably because just looking at charts does not seem like the most interesting pastime in the world. These patterns are also a handy tool for surmising what sort of behavior can be anticipated next. Katie Martin of the Financial Times got the idea of a vomiting camel on the internet and made a whole gag out of it. It comes down to a technique similar to recognizing constellations: quite a bit of imagination. She thought it was an obvious joke - but not many caught on, really. She explains the whole thing in a post, showing how she just drew camels wherever, and tried to make them throw up. In the case of Bitcoin, last November she was completely right, though.  Except, in 2014, CNBC ran a segment on the vomiting camel that was tongue-in-cheek, but was taken too seriously. And this April, TradingView, for example, had a piece called “The Dreaded Vomiting Camel of Bitcoin.” ""The pattern speaks for itself of how the camel is drawn over the lifespan of the stock/coin. The end of this pattern is the actual vomit which show the 3 red arrows of the drop that may be impending,"" the piece said. Taking it seriously is just not thinking it through. It’s a badly drawn picture of a sick mammal, how predictive can it be for any market? Still, if you can find a pattern in market behavior through MS Paint pictures of animals, godspeed. She concludes her explaining post by saying, “If you buy or sell anything based on the camels, then the very best of luck to you. You'll need it. On the plus side, I guess it's no sillier than any other form of technical analysis. Cut me into any profits.”",2018-04-19
" The past few hours were very bullish as most altcoins rallied sharply and gained between 15-50%. This indicates that the market sentiment is bullish and there could be more upsides in the near term. On the other hand, bitcoin, ethereum and ripple consolidated in a tight range above key supports in the bullish zone. Once these major cryptocurrencies stage an upside breakout, the market could accelerate higher. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is slowly gaining momentum above the USD 8,000 support. However, BTC/USD must clear a strong sell wall near the USD 8,250 - USD 8,300 zone. 
A successful close above the USD 8,300 resistance may perhaps start a fresh bullish wave toward the USD 8,700 and USD 9,000 levels. The price is waiting for a catalyst for a bullish breakout. 
On the downside, supports are near the USD 8,000 and USD 7,800 levels. Ethereum
Ethereum is showing signs of an upside break above the USD 530 level. ETH/USD may soon extend gains above the USD 535 and 540 levels. If buyers gain momentum, the price could even break the USD 550 level.
If there is a downside correction, the USD 520 and USD 510 levels are likely to act as decent supports. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash once again performed really well among the top five cryptocurrencies. BCH/USD tested the USD 900 level and is currently trading 6.1% higher at USD 888. Above the USD 900 resistance, the price could make an attempt to test the USD 1,000 level.
Ripple is trading nicely above the USD 0.70 level. XRP/USD traded close to the USD 0.74 level before starting a downside correction. It seems like the price may continue to grind higher toward the USD 0.78 level in the near term. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many small cap altcoins rallied sharply today, including Monaco, Pundi X, BAT, Mithril, WAX, Augur, ReddCoin, TenX, Bitcoin Private and SmartCash. The current market sentiment is super bullish, suggesting further gains during the upcoming sessions. Bitcoin traders should keep a close watch on the USD 8,300 resistance for an upside break towards the USD 9,000 level.",2018-04-19
" Cryptocurrency trade monitoring site VeneBloc has reported a massive spike in Bitcoin buying in Venezuela, with a record USD 1 million worth of bolivar to BTC purchases made on April 17 alone. Bloomberg reports that Venezuelans are increasingly turning to the cryptocurrency market as a means of buying dollars and other foreign currencies, with BTC-to-dollar trades also on the rise in the country – while the bolivar tumbles in value. The government imposed laws restricting foreign exchange trading in 2003, although many businesses in the country only accept payment in dollars and a thriving black market for foreign currencies has also developed. The country has recently unveiled its own state cryptocurrency, the Petro, which is backed by Venezuela’s huge oil reserves. Earlier this week, the Petro (which is banned in the United States), received an award from Russia’s leading crypto association, the Russian Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Association, who praised the Petro’s “outstanding contribution to the development of the blockchain industry.” Some experts have claimed the Petro was developed with Russian support, with government officials playing a key role – a charge denied by the country’s finance ministry. Earlier this month, the Venezuelan government issued a decree stating that all state-owned businesses must accept payment in Petro, while the president created two cabinet posts to deal with cryptocurrency-related matters.",2018-04-19
" Back in 2015, a Chinese entrepreneur and his partner spent USD 2.35 million bidding on a private lunch with an investor and one of the richest man in the world Warren Buffett, whom he considers his idol. Back then, they were hoping to get some investment advice from the legendary investor. Today, the 31-year-old businessman still uses his photo with Buffett as his phone's wallpaper. However, he is far from thrilled with the opinion his hero has on the sticky subject of cryptocurrency. Out of all the things he’s learned from Buffett, Sam Ling has kept an appreciation for index funds closest to his heart - but he’d now like to apply that outlook to crypto. He told CNBC, “Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are too volatile, and that's why we are launching cryptocurrency indexes. Over the past six months, our index has a lower decline than bitcoin during corrections, but has outperformed bitcoin by 50 to 80 percent during upsurges.” Out of all the advice he’s received at this USD 2.35 million lunch, Ling recalls, “Buffett touched on lots of issues during that lunch, but in the end, he said, ‘Focus on what you are doing and you are already successful.’ This quote really left me with a deep impression and I followed his advice.” But Ling is not that starstruck: he believes in the power of crypto. “Warren Buffett just won a 10-year bet that an index fund would outperform a collection of hedge funds over that time. And I want to make a bet with him that my cryptocurrency index will outperform his portfolio over the same period.” Buffett has not yet commented on the situation, but the world waits to see whether he accepts the bet or not.",2018-04-18
" With the none too anticipated Tax Day looming in the US on April 17 and nobody really knowing how to file their crypto assets, many traders think this is exactly what’s holding Bitcoin and other coins back this year. Spencer Bogart, partner at Blockchain Capital, told CNBC, “Tax-selling has been a significant factor in downward crypto prices over the past few weeks. I would expect this downward pressure to abate after tax day.” The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) views Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as property, meaning profits from transactions are subject to capital gains tax. The problem with that is that, while this is clear in principle, nobody really knows how to apply it to their crypto gains, many of which people didn’t document in time. Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told CNBC that US traders owe a total of USD 25 billion in taxes for digital currency holdings due to the prices rising more than 1,300% last year in the case of Bitcoin. Lee is also the only major Wall Street strategist to issue crypto price targets, and in his opinion, Bitcoin may be hitting a similar bottom to where it was a month before it hit USD 20,000 in 2017 (it was USD 7,000 - USD 8,000 at the time). Pantera Capital Founder and CEO Dan Morehead said in an investor letter published last week that bitcoin is ""highly likely to have exceeded USD 20,000 within a year."" An investor Tim Draper, famous for how bullish he is in Bitcoin, also predicted a price jump: by 2022, the cryptocurrency could hit USD 250,000.",2018-04-17
" Out of the 69 Bitcoin forks to date, just 10 are tradable on exchanges, according to Forkdrop.io data. Combined, these have a value of USD 941, or around 0.12 BTC, news.bitcoin.com reported. Additionally, without Bitcoin Cash, only USD 206 or 0.026 BTC remains - a possible proof of the futility and triviality of Bitcoin forking. Following the launch of Bitcoin Cash last August, subsequent forks have been rapidly deteriorating, quality-wise. Forkdrop.io has a handy list that shows most of these forks are not tradable. The website’s resources include guides to claiming these forked coins and sections on passive and active airdrops. If you hold (or HODL) BTC, you can claim these forks for free. But with these numbers, claiming them may just not be worth it. Bitcoin Candy, Bitcoin Cloud or even Bitcoin Holocaust are names that hardly could inspire any confidence.  Forked altcoins, although fewer in number, are just as useless - forkdrop.io lists 18 altcoin forks, although many more have forked by cloning the code and then adding their own twist. A well-known example is Verge, a fork of Dogecoin that was never made available on a 1:1 basis to Doge holders. A total of six Ethereum forks, three Litecoin forks, and six Monero forks are listed on the website, along with a couple of others. And out of all the altcoin forks, three of them are tradeable - with a combined value of USD 20. Interestingly, there is one fork not listed on the website is Bitcoin Private, as it simultaneously forked from Zclassic and Bitcoin. It started trading at around USD 80, but has dropped four-fold in under a month. In short, forking may be destined for failure no matter what the resulting coin is like after Bitcoin Cash - or at least that’s what all the other examples are telling us. The cost of creating a hard fork is essentially zero, so we will continue to see more and more hard forks that attempt to create a user base via forking coins to an already established community, as reported by Cryptonews.com. According to experts, in order to evaluate a hard fork and its potential it's always good to ask three questions: 1) Does the fork solve a real problem? 2) Is the team behind the fork credible and competent? 3) Is there a healthy community and open discussion surrounding the fork? If the answer to any of these three questions is a ""no"", it should raise a red flag for an investor.",2018-04-16
" This past week, there was a solid bullish wave in bitcoin and altcoins. The crypto market turned green and prices soared between 10-25%. More importantly, BTC/USD broke two important resistances at USD 7,500 and USD 8,000, opening the doors for more gains this week. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price cleared a major hurdle at USD 8,000 this past week and moved towards the USD 8,400-8,500 zone. On the upside, BTC/USD is facing a crucial resistance near USD 8,500, which must be cleared for further gains.
On the downside, there are many supports such as USD 8,000, USD 7,800 and USD 7,500. If the pair drops below the last mentioned USD 7,500 support, there could be a change in the trend.
In the short term, the price may trade in a small range before it makes an attempt to overcome sellers near USD 8,250 and USD 8,500. Ethereum
Ethereum also followed bitcoin and registered around 20% gains this past week. ETH/USD settled above a major barrier at USD 500, and it is currently consolidating gains above the stated level.
Weekly resistances on the upside are at USD 530 and 550. A push above the USD 550 level could clear the path for a bullish acceleration toward USD 600. On the downside, supports are at USD 500, USD 480 and USD 465. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash had a good run and its price moved past the USD 700 and 750 resistance levels. BCH/USD is now positioned nicely above USD 750 and it seems to be preparing for a break above the USD 800 resistance.
Ripple finally broke to the upside and settled above the USD 0.60 resistance. If the current momentum stays intact, XRP/USD could move above USD 0.70 and test the USD 0.75 level in the near term. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, ICON and Cardano are performing really well. ICX price is up 10.8% to USD 2.77, and ADA price broke the USD 0.22 resistance.

" Media outlet Chosun Biz reports that according to a survey of 800 South Korean adults, one in three citizens aged 18 and above has invested in cryptocurrencies. The survey was conducted by exchange platform Bithumb, who said that traders’ average holdings were worth some USD 5,050. Per the survey, 35% of respondents said they had used a cryptocurrency exchange platform, while 40% of cryptocurrency investors said “curiosity” had driven them to buy tokens. The survey also found that older investors tended to make much bigger investments, with respondents in their fifties investing an average of over three times as much in cryptocurrencies as people in their twenties. There is also a huge discrepancy between the average high among investors, which stands at some USD 21,000 per the survey, and the average low investment - which is a mere USD 215. Respondents also said that security systems and system stability were the most important factors to consider when choosing which exchange platform to use. April has been a mixed bag for South Korean exchange platforms, with a trading information leak suspected at Bithumb last week, the arrest of two rival exchange CEOs the week before – and a range of new partnership deals announced at the start of the month.",2018-04-16
" Yesterday, we discussed how there was a sharp rise in altcoins, but bitcoin was struggling. Later, BTC joined the party, broke a crucial resistance at USD 7,000, which resulted in a sharp upside move of more than USD 1,000. It seems like the crypto market consolidation phase completed, resulting in increase in trading volumes.  Fundamentally, a key development was from the Islamic community. There was a declaration by an Islamic scholar that bitcoin is compatible by Sharia Law. More importantly, bitcoin and ethereum charts were heading towards a technical breakout during the past few weeks. The recent upside drift suggests that the breakout was bullish and prices are likely to continue higher. There was a solid short liquidation and unwinding of short (sell) BTC trades, resulting in a short squeeze from well below USD 6,800 to well above USD 8,000. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price rocketed above yesterday’s mentioned USD 7,000 resistance. BTC/USD gained around 20% and traded above the USD 8,000 level. The pair is now trading at USD 8,106 and it may perhaps continue to rise towards the USD 8,500 level.
If there is a downside correction, the price may find support near the USD 8,000 level. Below the stated USD 8,000, the price could test the USD 7,800 support.
On the upside, before the USD 8,500 barrier, the price may find selling interest near the USD 8,250 level. However, the current trend is super bullish and bulls are completely in control for a run towards USD 8,500. Ethereum
Ethereum also followed bitcoin and rocketed above the USD 500 level. ETH/USD is currently trading 22% higher at USD 515. On the upside, the next major hurdle for buyers is at USD 540.
On the downside, the broken resistances at USD 500 and 480 are likely to act as supports in the short term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash moved sharply above the USD 700 level and is currently up 15% to USD 760. BCH/USD pair is now seems to be heading towards the USD 800 level, which is a key resistance.
Ripple soared higher and moved past the USD 0.60 resistance, which is a bullish signal. XRP/USD is now in a positive zone and the price may continue to move higher towards USD 0.70. Other Altcoins Market Today
Almost all coins are trading in the green zone with gains between 10-25%. A few coins such as MITH, BTCP, Steem, OMG, IOTA and WAN outperformed and registered heavy gains today.

" In the past 24 hours as of the time of writing, the whole cryptocurrency market is in green, and the only red ones - Tether and aelf - among the 100 biggest coins by market cap are falling by small margins.  Thomas Lee, head of research of Fundstrat Global Advisors LLC, cited a combination of Santander’s plan for a blockchain-based payment application, tax-related selling almost over and speculative short investors being squeezed out of the market for the surge, Bloomberg reported. Given that this is perhaps the most bullish shift in the market in this year, following the bloodbath in winter and the subsequent bearish atmosphere, how is the community reacting? People are not as enthusiastic as before, actually. However, the community is showing more maturity than ever before, perhaps: as one user of Reddit points out, if this jump had come a few months earlier, “pеople would have shouted end of bear market moon lambo and so on,” but now, the discussion has turned to “leveraged shorts, manipulation, scepticism towards the pump and overall constructive thinking” in a big step away from the usual bright-eyed optimism. A commenter on the same thread thinks that, “The moon/lambo types have already forgotten about crypto and moved on to the next shiny thing.” In another thread, user u/florian_ehrbar says, “I’ve been watching this [market jump] and my jaw just keeps dropping!” as proof that nobody is quite indifferent. Twitter is also silent, as the only people celebrating seem to be fans of mostly controversial altcoins such as TRON. The community is showing more restraint than ever before. This does not mean people are not overjoyed, however. Anyone who has invested in almost any coin in the crypto space is gaining, but what’s conspicuously lacking are the memes and the “when moon” and “when lambo” comments. Although benign and not unfunny (when not overused), they did cause the rest of the world to see the crypto space as a childish place, not yet a force to be reckoned with. This may just be a step in the right direction for the building and development of a serious new market that could change the nature of the game. *** Top 10 coins in the past 24 hours (8 AM GMT, Friday):",2018-04-13
" The past few sessions were mostly green for altcoins, whereas bitcoin struggled to gain upside momentum. It is still well below the USD 7,000 resistance, which is a bearish sign. Technically, altcoins are showing many bullish signals, but if bitcoin joins the party, there could be a sharp upside move in the crypto market. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price attempted an upside move, but it could not move above the USD 7,000 resistance. BTC/USD traded near USD 6,990 before starting a downside move.
The price is currently down 0.3% and is trading near the USD 6,830 level. The next supports on the downside are at USD 6,750 and 6,600. 
To initiate an upside move, bitcoin buyers need to break the USD 7,000 barrier. It is an important resistance, therefore, a successful break above the stated level could open the doors for a solid bullish wave in the near term towards USD 7,500. Ethereum
Ethereum traded nicely and made a new weekly high above the USD 435 level. ETH/USD is currently up 1.3% to USD 422, with an immediate support at USD 415. Below the mentioned USD 415 support, the price could retest the USD 400 level.
On the upside, the price faces a short-term resistance at USD 435, followed by the USD 440 hurdle. Above the stated USD 440, the price may attempt a break above USD 450. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is showing positive signs above the USD 650 level. BCH/USD is currently trading 1.55% higher to USD 661. The pair needs to gain momentum above USD 680 to gain strength. On the downside, supports are at USD 650 and USD 640.
Ripple bounced back sharply and moved above USD 0.50. There are a few positive signs emerging, but XRP/USD must hold gains above the USD 0.50 level to remain in a bullish zone. Other Altcoins Market Today
Altcoins market is mostly green today lead by coins such as EOS, ZIL and ADA. EOS was one of the leaders since it jumped more than 30% and is currently trading above the USD 8.0 level. More importantly, EOS is now ranked fifth in terms of the total market capitalization. The current market sentiment is very positive, but bitcoin’s struggle to gain strength could lead to a downfall.",2018-04-12
" Paying in crypto now comes at a 50% premium, it would seem. Hedge fund manager Claudio Guazzoni de Zanett has decided to sell his 12,380 square feet (1,150 sq m), 7 bed, 14 bath home in New York for a measly USD 30 million. He will also accept crypto, says the ad - but then it’s worth the equivalent of USD 45 million. Aside from BTC, he will also accept Ethereum and Ripple. This increase is to offset the volatility in crypto price, he said to Wall Street Journal: “I’m a true believer in these networks, but it’s very volatile. They could be down 60% in two weeks.” And he does seem to believe: according to his LinkedIn profile, he has founded Zanett Cryptocurrency Group in 2016, and appears to have been investing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain since at least 2015. The 22-foot-wide, marble-and-limestone house at East 76th Street near Fifth Avenue has served as Mr. Zanett’s family compound since 1994. The house dates back to 1904 and includes an original vault in the basement area that extends under the street. “Fabulously situated,” as the ad says, on a block of the Upper East Side's Gold Coast between Fifth and Madison Avenues, the question remains - is it really worth USD 45 million in BTC? Interestingly, this is the same man who was slapped with USD 8,000 in summonses for advertising this very same home as a short-term rental only a year ago, according to New York Post. State laws forbid to even advertise short-term rentals in multiple-unit buildings for fewer than 30 days unless the owner is also living in the rented unit. Perhaps your early investing portfolio in crypto has already gone to the moon, but let’s face it - you’d much rather buy yourself a garage of lambos for this amount. But if you're still interested in the townhouse, here is how it looks:",2018-04-12
" A JPMorgan Chase credit card customer is suing the financial services provider for slapping what he labels “sky-high” interest rates and fees on the bills of cryptocurrency investors. Brady Tucker, of Idaho in the United States, says the credit card provider began charging him interest rates of as much as 30% per year – as well as additional fees – on cryptocurrency purchases made through Coinbase exchange in January this year. Tucker says the fees are disproportionate and unprecedented, and lodged a class-action suit at a federal court in Manhattan, New York. Tucker says he wants a full refund of the fees he has been charged – as well as damages of USD 1 million. Tucker made reference to a quote made last year by JPMorgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, who has denounced Bitcoin in the past. Last year Dimon said he would “fire” any of his staff whom he found trading cryptocurrencies for ""stupidity."" Tucker wrote, “It appears that in addition to firing its ’stupid’ employees, Chase has elected to start fining its ‘stupid’ customers: unilaterally.” JPMorgan has recently announced it will not allow cryptocurrency purchases, saying that account holders might dispute charges if they bought coins from what they later discovered were fake initial coin offering (ICO) issuers. In February, JPMorgan said Bitcoin’s design might contain a fatal flaw whereby its decentralized nature could prevent it from being able to handle liquidity shocks.",2018-04-12
" In another attempt to value Bitcoin and predict prices, analysts at Barclays, a British bank, score points for originality, likening it to an infectious disease, and saying that it might be over very soon. In a note to clients on Tuesday, Barclays analyst Joseph Abate writes, “Like infection, transmission - especially to those with ‘fear of missing out’ - is by word-of-mouth, via blogs, news reports and personal anecdotes. However, once full adoption is approached, the price decline is sustained and rapid.” This model suggests that crypto awareness is universal at this point, so only a tiny group of the population could catch speculative interest, and current holders are also developing “immunity” to more investment. “We believe the speculative froth phase of cryptocurrency investment – and perhaps peak prices – may have passed,” Abate says. The Barclays model splits the population into three sectors: the susceptible ones, the vulnerable and the immune people. The infected make up 0.1% of the population who first bought crypto with an unknown long-term fundamental value, while the susceptibles make up 25% due to FOMO (fear of missing out), mostly. A number of people are “immune” and not likely to ever buy. Still, according to the analyst, crypto may see an increase in demand from weaker economies with little to no investment opportunities. Abate explains, “Cryptocurrencies may have a home in low-trust corners of the global economy. Broader adoption of crypto technologies faces critical challenges and strong incumbents.” The total cryptocurrency market capitalization, according to Barclays, has a “generous upper bound” between USD 660 billion and USD 780 billion - an amount near the total at the end of January.",2018-04-11
" BitFlyer, Japan's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, has partnered with SBC Medical Group for a deal that will allow the latter’s customers to settle their bills in bitcoin. SBC operates the Shonan Beauty Clinic chain, Japan’s largest network of cosmetic surgery, dermatology, acupuncture and dentistry clinics. In total, some 74 clinics nationwide will now accept bitcoin payment via BitFlyer’s blockchain-powered payment platform. The maximum transaction amount is 2 million yen (around USD 18,700). BitFlyer has already enabled bitcoin pay at over 10,000 Japanese outlets, including electronics retailer BIC Camera, the Marui Group’s department stores and fashion and accessories outlets, the HIS tour operator and restaurant booking site Gurunavi. BitFlyer yesterday announced it was working on an open blockchain query language that it hopes to have available “within a year.” In related news, per media outlet Okinawa Times, the Japanese Cryptocurrency Exchange Association has claimed that Japanese cryptocurrency trading and transactions in FY2017 totaled some USD 645 billion, 20 times higher than FY2016 figures – with over 90% of crypto trade conducted in BTC.",2018-04-11
" There was a solid start to the week yesterday as bitcoin climbed above the USD 7,000 level. Other major cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, bitcoin cash and ripple also gained traction. However, they all failed to hold gains and started a fresh bearish wave. It seems like a technical rejection in bitcoin and altcoins coupled with a new round of selling. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price declined 5.6% and is currently trading at USD 6,750. If BTC/USD continues to move down, the next support is near USD 6,600. However, the most important support is around the last low at USD 6,400. 
Should the price fail to stay above USD 6,400, there are chances of a downside reaction towards USD 6,000 in the near term.  On the flip side, the price has to trade above the USD 7,000 level to overcome an increase in selling pressure.
Above USD 7,000, the next resistance awaits at USD 7,200 and 7,250. Ethereum
Ethereum was rejected from the USD 430 region and is currently down 7.1% to USD 395. ETH/USD is back in the red zone and if sellers remain in control, it could decline towards the all-important USD 360 support.
To start a recovery, the price must settle above the USD 400-405 area. Above the mentioned USD 405, the price may perhaps retest the USD 430 resistance. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash failed to stay above the USD 650 level and declined sharply. BCH/USD is down 6.3% to USD 635 and it seems like the pair may continue to move down. Immediate supports on the downside are at USD 620 and USD 600.
Ripple is back below the USD 0.50 support. XRP/USD failed on many occasions to settle above the mentioned USD 0.50, which puts it at a risk of further declines in the near term. Other Altcoins Market Today
Many altcoins followed bitcoin today and declined, but Verge remained in the green zone. XVG is up 15% to USD 0.082 and it may continue to gain upside momentum. The company was successful in completing a fork, which increased buying sentiment during the past three days. To sum up, it seems like bitcoin and altcoins failed to capitalize and started a fresh bearish wave. Having said that, if BTC/USD moves back above USD 7,000, there could be a decent recovery.",2018-04-10
" In another effort to find ways to mine crypto as cheaply as possible, from combining the excess heat from your mining rig to grow tomatoes or heat your own room to moving to small towns where electricity is cheaper, using Google may just take the prize for most original idea. Uri Shaked is an Israeli “Google Developer Expert for Web Technologies, Maker and Public Speaker”, according to his Medium profile. He  managed to find a way to use Google’s BigQuery, a big data analytics web service, for crypto mining. Although his Medium post goes deep into the technical details, from explaining how mining works in the first place to deep into how and why this is actually free, the gist is this: his approach is technically just generating a large amount of random data using pre-existing tables, as mining basically involves guessing the right number. Although BigQuery only allows up to 1 terabyte of data analysis per month and then charges per analyzed byte above that amount, as far as they are concerned, he’s analyzing zero bytes per hash. In other words - for free. He also points out that while this works in theory, it is not an actual process that could generate him any sort of income: “even if such a miner was built, when competing with all the dedicated mining hardware running around the world, it would make me roughly USD 5 a year,” his post explains, going on to clarify that although not viable, knowing that crypto can be mined this way is “priceless.”",2018-04-10
" The “blockchain vs Bitcoin” narrative is an old one, and the stance among the more traditional audience such as regulators, bankers and investors was very often blockchain over Bitcoin - in that the cryptocurrency is the much-touted bubble, while the underlying technology offers exciting new opportunities. But is this still the case, or has the time for cryptocurrency come at last? Checking the prices of crypto shows us that the bear market continues and shows no signs of slowing - all the biggest coins have taken a nosedive this year. For Brian Kelly, founder and CEO at BKCM LLC, an investment firm focused on cryptocurrencies, this means more screen time for blockchain. “Last year was all about the froth, and the promise of, 'Hey, this guy's building the new Facebook.' I think this year is going to be about building the Ciscos [an American multinational technology conglomerate],” he said to CNBC. In his opinion, “2018 is going to be the year of infrastructure and also the year of Ethereum competitors.” Adding to this, he says there are many risk rewards to using a platform like Cardano that runs the blockchain technology for its coin ADA: “It's relatively new. You can do smart contracts on it. You can do blockchain 3.0. It's an Ethereum competitor in the year of Ethereum competitors.” But the perspective could have shifted from blockchain back to crypto in the opinion of Elizabeth Stark, the CEO of Lightning Labs. She told a never-before told story for Yahoo Finance about the overpowering narrative of the superiority of blockchain and how it impacted Lightning Labs:  
“When we first pitched my company Lightning Labs, we actually took the word ‘Bitcoin’ out of our deck and our marketing material because it was so much about blockchain. Now, I feel like we’ve entered into a ‘Bitcoin, not blockchain’ world, where people understand the value of cryptocurrency technology and what these can bring.” “When we first pitched my company Lightning Labs, we actually took the word ‘Bitcoin’ out of our deck and our marketing material because it was so much about blockchain. Now, I feel like we’ve entered into a ‘Bitcoin, not blockchain’ world, where people understand the value of cryptocurrency technology and what these can bring.” This could mean better business for her: since Lightning is a second layer built on top of the Bitcoin protocol that can facilitate faster and cheaper transactions, because the payments happen off-blockchain, Bitcoin could become more viable as a payment option. She goes on to explain, “We’re talking many thousands of transactions per second, one day maybe even millions per second… Bitcoin at its base layer can’t do that. But Lightning, because it’s this layer on top of it, can.” Not everyone agrees: in the “Bitcoin is a bubble” corner that the industry seems to have gotten used to, Bank of America Corp says Bitcoin, “the biggest bubble in history,” is popping. As reported by Bloomberg, Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett wrote that Bitcoin is tracking the downfalls of the other massive asset-price bubbles in history less than one year out from its record, comparing it, for example, to the famed tulip mania of the Dutch. So, to answer the titular question of focus: it depends on whom you ask. The more time goes on, the more obvious it becomes that not every crypto-skeptic can be won over, and that many will remain bearish on crypto and bullish on blockchain. Luckily, however, people such as Ms Stark are working on solutions that will bring crypto closer to the general public without separating it from its roots and the much-loved blockchain technology. It is in the best interest of the industry as a whole to believe that, while both sides have hard-working believers, the technological advancements of society may well move beyond our wildest dreams.",2018-04-10
" The past few sessions were mostly bearish on cryptocurrencies as bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, ripple and litecoin failed to make an upside move. Yesterday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a notice and banned all regulated entities to deal with any individual or business dealing in virtual currencies such as bitcoin. The market sentiment remains bearish and if sellers step up the momentum, there could be more losses. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price declined further after settling below the USD 7,000 support. BTC/USD even broke the USD 6,800 pivot level and is currently down 4.4% to USD 6,580. An immediate support awaits near USD 6,500, followed by a key support at USD 6,200.
If the price fails to stay above the USD 6,200 support, it may perhaps test a crucial support at USD 6,000 in the near term. 
To start a recovery, the price has to break the USD 6,800 pivot level and surpass the USD 7,000 barrier. Above USD 7,000, the price may move in a positive zone with the next hurdle at USD 7,200. Ethereum
Ethereum is now trading well below the USD 400 level. ETH/USD is even finding it hard to hold a crucial support at USD 360. If sellers succeed in breaking the USD 360 support, the pair may even clear the USD 350 level.
On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 380, followed by the all-important USD 400. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is slowly grinding lower towards the USD 600 support. BCH/USD is under a lot of pressure and it could even break the USD 600 support. A break below USD 600 may perhaps put the pair on a bearish path towards USD 500.
Ripple is in a declining mode towards the USD 0.45 level. XRP/USD failed to stay above the USD 0.50 level and is now gaining bearish momentum towards the USD 0.42 support. Other Altcoins Market Today
Most altcoins are down today and remain at a risk of more downsides. The market sentiment has turned further negative since RBI’s announcement.

" Yesterday, we discussed whether bitcoin price can stay above a major support at USD 7,000 or not. It failed to hold gains above the stated level and declined towards USD 6,600. Similarly, major cryptocurrencies such as ethereum, bitcoin cash, ripple and litecoin also traded lower and declined 5-8%. It seems like the last recovery wave was not convincing and prices are now back to where they started the week. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price broke the USD 7,000 support and traded as low as USD 6,560. BTC/USD is currently down 6.5% to USD 6,830 and is showing a few bearish signs.
The pair must stay above the USD 6,600 support to avoid any further declines. Below the stated USD 6,600 support, there is a risk of a downside break towards the USD 6,000 level. An intermediate support is at USD 6,200. 
On the upside, the broken support at USD 7,000 may once again act as a resistance. Above this last, the USD 7,200 is the next resistance. Ethereum
Ethereum failed to hold gains above a crucial support at USD 400 and declined towards USD 365. ETH/USD is currently struggling near the USD 380 level and is trading 5.5% lower from the USD 404 high.
If the price has to recover in the short term, it has to settle above USD 400. On the downside, supports are at USD 365, 360 and 350. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash continued to weaken and is currently trading well below the USD 700 pivot level. It is down 7.3% to USD 638 with an immediate support at USD 620. Below USD 620, the price may even break the USD 600 level.
Ripple is down 7.2% and is trading below USD 0.50. There was no upside break above the USD 0.55 level yesterday, which increased selling pressure on XRP/USD. Other Altcoins Market Today

To sum up, the market sentiment has turned bearish again. However, it seems like bears are lacking momentum, which could result in a fresh upside wave in the near term.",2018-04-05
" Yesterday, a decent upside recovery was initiated in the cryptocurrency market. Most coins staged a decent recovery, but later they failed to gain upside momentum. At the moment, prices are correcting lower and trading near crucial support levels. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price traded towards the USD 7,400 and USD 7,500 resistance levels where it faced strong offers. BTC/USD failed to move past the mentioned resistances and started a downside correction.
It is down 0.8% to USD 7,280 with an immediate support at USD 7,200. The next major support on the downside awaits at USD 7,000, which must holds losses. If the price fails to stay above USD 7,000, the price may move back in a bearish zone.
On the other hand, bitcoin buyers must push the price above the USD 7,400 and USD 7,500 resistance levels to accelerate gains. Ethereum
Ethereum traded above the USD 400 level, but it could not break the USD 415 - USD 420 resistance zone. ETH/USD must stay above the USD 400 support to avoid a downside reaction.
Should there be a downside break below USD 400, the price could decline back towards the previous swing low at USD 560. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash failed to hold gains near the USD 700 and is currently down 0.85% to USD 680. BCH/USD must settle above the USD 700 to continue trading higher. On the downside, supports are near USD 660 and USD 650.

" “Buy the dip and HODL,” said Bitcoin bull Thomas Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisor, on CNBC’s post-market show ""Fast Money"" on Wednesday. “The mood in crypto is terrible right now,” the esteemed Wall Street analyst said. “Long-time holders are worried because they have big gains and they're worried about falling prices. But Bitcoin is a great store of value. It works really well. It's kind of boring, because it's not the latest and most exciting project. But it also is one of the most liquid ways to get exposure to crypto.” In a Wednesday note, Lee wrote about the 10 best days for Bitcoin each year, comparing them to the traditional market: “Market timing is generally discouraged in traditional equity investing. If an investor missed out on the 10 best days (for S&P 500 [an American stock market index]) each year, the annualized return drops to 5.4% (ex-10 best), from 9.2%. In other words, the case for buy and hold in equities is the opportunity cost of missing out on the 10 best days.” So if an investor was to miss out on the 10 best days for Bitcoin, the annualized return drops 25% annually, Lee writes. On average, Bitcoin was down every year with the exclusion of the top 10 day gains, according to Fundstrat data. 2017, for instance, had a total of 12 days representing the full-year return of BTC. But the analysis for the S&P 500's performance goes back to 1954, while the nine-day average for the full-year gains of Bitcoin only goes back to 2013. This means it is unclear whether historical analysis on the decades-old stock market is appropriate for the far more volatile cryptocurrency that's only 9 years old. Bitcoin is trading at the breakeven cost of mining, at about USD 8,000, based on a model by Fundstrat, Bloomberg added. ""We see positive catalysts for Bitcoin later in 2018, including the clarification of regulatory hurdles,"" Fundstrat analysts wrote in the note. In addition, Bitcoin's current low selling price, gives investors who aren't familiar with cryptocurrency a chance to study the industry, rather than jumping in feet first, CNBC reported citing Lee. ""As bad as it feels right now, Bitcoin has a lot more upside,"" he said.",2018-03-29

Bitcoin price traded towards the USD 7,720 level before starting an upside correction. BTC/USD is currently up around 0.7% to USD 7,950. 
On the upside, the pair may soon break the USD 8,000 resistance. However, there are many barriers on the upside such as USD 8,200 and USD 8,500. Only a close above the USD 8,500 level could clear the path for more gains.
On the downside, the USD 7,800 level is an initial support, followed by the last swing low of USD 7,720. Ethereum
Ethereum tumbled below the USD 450 level and tested the USD 440 level. It is currently trading flat near the USD 455 level. ETH/USD must gain upside momentum above USD 475 to start a decent recovery.
Above USD 475, the price may perhaps test the next major resistance at USD 500. On the downside, the USD 440-450 region is a crucial support in the near term. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash failed to follow BTC and remains in a bearish zone below the USD 890 level. BCH/USD is down 2.66% to USD 884 and it remains at a risk of more declines. On the upside, the USD 900 and USD 920 levels are important resistances.
Ripple is slowly recovering and is currently trading 0.32% higher to USD 0.58. XRP/USD must succeed in breaking the USD 0.60 and USD 0.62 resistance levels for more recoveries towards USD 0.65. Other Altcoins Market Today
As mentioned, there were many small altcoins such as ONT, MITH, SYS, BTM, PIVX and EOS, which posted decent gains between 10-20%. Out of these, Ontology (ONT) was the best performer. Its price is currently up around 50% to USD 2.69. There were interoperability rumors, which pushed ONT price higher. In short, it seems like there are signs of a short term recovery in the crypto market. However, bitcoin price must move above USD 8,200 and USD 8,500 to confirm recovery signs.",2018-03-28
" The Spanish police have arrested a cybercrime gang hailing from both Russia and Ukraine, reported to have been involved in stealing USD 1.24 billion and laundering them using Bitcoin, Associated Press reported. More than a 100 financial institutions were targeted over a period of 5 years; the criminals managed to get away with as much as EUR 10 million in each heist. According to Interpol and Spanish police statements, the leader of the gang is an Ukrainian called “Denis K.” who was arrested along with three suspected accomplices from Russia and Ukraine in the Spanish city of Alicante.  The group would gain access to the affected banking networks by sending phishing emails with malicious attachments to bank officials. The malware would then let the gang members gain control over affected hardware, allowing them to break into ATMs and use the machines to withdraw unlimited sums of money. According to the authorities, although the attacks happened to financial institutions worldwide, almost all Russian banks were affected and about 50 of them did lose money in the attacks. The AP also reports that the criminals did not spend their ill-gained money, instead opting for changing it into bitcoin, which was then used for buying different assets, including real estate and vehicles in Spain. Back in February, the Thai police arrested Sergey Medvedev, said to be the number two person in an international cybercrime organization and administrator of the Dark Web site Infraud, who, at the time of arrest, was in possession of over 100,000 Bitcoins (USD 799 million).",2018-03-27
" Puzzles have always been a popular pastime with many, in all their different iterations. Now fans of both crypto and puzzles get the best of both worlds with crypto puzzles. Solving the puzzle gives you the key to the wallet with the reward, to be claimed by the fastest brain in the race. On Friday, Gizmodo reported the story of an artist, Andy Bauch, with his abstract artwork in which he hid the private key to a crypto-wallet with various types and amounts of cryptocurrency. He bought amounts of bitcoin, litecoin, and other altcoins in 2016 and put them in different digital wallets. Each wallet is encrypted with a private key, consisting of letters and numbers, which are visually represented in his works. Buying a piece of his art does not mean that you own the private key, as anyone who figures out the code will be able to take the money for themselves. However, Bauch told Gizmodo that he will give the purchaser of any painting “a hint.” He added, “A lot of the work that I’m doing is trying to span this gap that often exists between new technology and humanity.” As of right now, all of the crypto appears to still be in each wallet, meaning that either no one has cracked any of the codes, or just not taken the money yet. Another visual puzzle, perhaps the best-known of them, was The Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto, a visual puzzle associated with the Bitcoin address 1FLAMEN6 that was created in 2015 with 5 BTC locked in. It was finally solved three years later, having previously been dubbed “fiendishly difficult”, by a programmer who hadn’t even heard of it until a month before finally cracking it. There are still more Bitcoin puzzles for aficionados to solve. For example, a tiny community on Reddit, with only 199 subscribers, offers a place for anyone who wants to share their puzzle with the world, or solve someone else’s. The challenges range from trivia games to scavenger hunts, with every title pointing out the difficulty level of the challenge and the reward. Another example is a video game called MonteCrypto: The Bitcoin Enigma, released in February. Described as “a maze filled with 24 mind-bending puzzles”, it promises one Bitcoin for the person who completes it first. It offers the possibility of working either alone or with others, as well as leading others to dead ends to slow them down. The Steam page of this game asks simply, “How much will players be willing to share, how much will they be able to compromise and who will claim access to the final vault of Montecrypto?” The game’s mysterious development team, Gem Rose Accent, hasn’t produced any other games, and they have said they wouldn’t reveal their identities until the prize is claimed. It would seem that the prize has either still not been claimed or simply not moved yet from the address. Whichever of these tickles your fancy, go for it - the possibilities are endless. Good luck!",2018-03-26
" There were swing moves this past week in all major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Ethereum, bitcoin cash, ripple and litecoin. Prices recovered after heavy losses, but upsides remained capped which resulted in a fresh downtrend. Bitcoin and Ethereum are currently trading near important support levels. If they fail to recover today, there could be further declines this week.  Bitcoin
Bitcoin price failed to settle above the USD 9,000 level this past week and declined. Recently, BTC/USD even broke a crucial support at USD 8,500 and USD 8,400.
The pair is currently trading below the USD 8,400 support and it remains at a risk of more losses this week. Weekly supports are at USD 8,000 and USD 7,800. Below USD 7,800, the price may accelerate declines towards USD 7,200.
If there is a recovery back above the USD 8,500 level, the price could retest the USD 9,000 pivot level this week. Ethereum
Ethereum remained in a bearish zone this past week and is currently trading below the USD 540 support level. ETH/USD is flirting with the USD 500 support and it could decline further.
If sellers succeed in a daily close below USD 500, the price will most likely retest the last low near USD 450. Weekly resistance levels are at USD 530, USD 540 and USD 550. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash recovered this past week from the USD 850 support, but it could not hold gains above USD 1,000. BCH/USD opened this week below the USD 1,000 level and is currently down 2.6%. On the downside, important weekly supports are at USD 900 and USD 850.
Ripple’s struggle to recover continued this past week. There was a short-term recovery above USD 0.65 in XRP/USD, but the pair was not able to gain momentum and is currently down to USD 0.61. It may perhaps decline further towards the USD 0.55 this week. Other Altcoins Market Today
There were a few altcoins which posted gains today such as Ontology and Request Network. Ontology (ONT) performed better and rose by more than 25% to climb above USD 1.70.  Overall, the market sentiment is slightly bearish this week. If bitcoin price fails to hold the USD 8,000 support, there could be further increase in bearish pressure on BTC and altcoins.",2018-03-26
" Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and payment company Square, has spoken of his strong belief in the future potential of Bitcoin in an interview with The Times, published on Wednesday. Dorsey, who himself is a noted Bitcoin investor, thinks Bitcoin will overtake the dollar in importance as it becomes the single global currency of the internet within a decade. He was revealed as a funder of Lightning Labs, which specialises in a technology that can potentially make Bitcoin cheaper and faster to use. He helped raise around USD 2.5 million for the startup that promises scalability, low fees and faster transaction times in a bid for Bitcoin adoption. He does admit that Bitcoin “does not have the capabilities right now to become an effective currency,” due to scaling issues. But he does believe that, with new technologies and innovations, those problems will soon fade: “It’s slow and it’s costly, but as more and more people have it, those things go away. There are newer technologies that build off of blockchain and make it more approachable.” Dorsey has been a vocal supporter for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general for a while now. His payment company Square introduced Bitcoin trading earlier this year. He also said in a conference call with Market Watch, “Bitcoin, for us, is not stopping at buying and selling. We do believe that this is a transformational technology for our industry, and we want to learn as quickly as possible.” However, Twitter may prohibit advertisements for initial coin offerings (ICOs), token sales, and cryptocurrency wallets globally in two weeks, as previously reported. The company may also ban all ads for cryptocurrency exchanges, with some limited exceptions.",2018-03-22
" Yesterday, a decent upward recovery was initiated in bitcoin, ether, ripple, bitcoin cash and other major cryptocurrencies. However, the mentioned recovery was capped as coins faced sellers near key resistance levels. The current technical structure is neutral to bearish until buyers succeed in pushing prices further higher. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price succeeded in settling above the USD 8,000 resistance. BTC/USD traded close to the USD 8,500 resistance, which acted as a key hurdle for more upsides. 
The pair is currently trading below the USD 8,500 resistance with a few negative signs. If buyers overcome selling pressure and succeeds in pushing the price above USD 8,500, there could be more gains toward USD 9,000.
On the other hand, a downside move may perhaps find support near USD 8,200 and USD 8,000. Ethereum
Ethereum could not gain strength above the USD 850 level, which resulted in a downside reaction. ETH/USD is currently trading 4.8% down to USD 518. 
An immediate support is at USD 500. If the pair fails to hold the stated USD 500 support, there could be an increase in selling pressure. The next important support is at USD 460. On the upside, the USD 540 and 550 levels remain key barriers for further recoveries. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is stable and is trading above the USD 940 and 950 support levels. BCH/USD has to move past the USD 1,000 resistance to gains strength. A failure to hold the USD 940 support may perhaps push the price toward USD 900.
Ripple is finally showing a few positive signs with a close above the USD 0.65 level. However, a break and close above the USD 0.70 and USD 0.75 resistance levels is must for further upsides. Other Altcoins Market Today
Qtum is doing well today and is currently trading above the USD 19.00 level. Recently, the Binance exchange added QTUM/USDT and QTUM/BNB trading pairs, which boosted the market sentiment. However, it is facing a significant resistance near USD 20.0. To sum up, it seems like the market recovered positively, but it could not maintain strength. If bitcoin price moves above USD 8,500 and ETH/USD breaks USD 850, the market may move into a bullish zone.",2018-03-20
" This past week was mostly bearish since all major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Ethereum, bitcoin cash, ripple, litecoin, Neo and ADA declined sharply. However, the G20 Summit was a positive event for the crypto world as the Financial Stability Board (FSB) hinted that cryptocurrencies do not pose any threats to global financial stability at this moment. Prices recovered and most coins opened this week on a positive note. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price was under a lot of pressure this past week and every upward correction faced sellers. BTC/USD settled below the USD 9,000 pivot level and even declined toward USD 7,000.
A low was formed near USD 7,320 before a major upward correction was initiated. The price has recovered by roughly USD 800 and is currently trading 6.8% higher to USD 8,200.
Weekly supports on the downside are at USD 8,000 and USD 7,300. If the price fails to move past USD 8,500 and USD 9,000 resistance levels this week, it could resume its decline toward USD 7,300. Ethereum
Ethereum was one of the worst performers among the top five cryptocurrencies. It tumbled below the USD 620 and USD 500 support levels and traded toward USD 450.
Later, the market sentiment improved and ETH/USD started a decent recovery. It is currently trading above the USD 500 level with weekly resistances on the upside at USD 550 and USD 600. Above USD 600, the price may move back in a positive zone. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash was comparatively stable this past week, but buyers failed to contain losses below the USD 1,000 support. BCH/USD tested the USD 850 support before recovering. It is currently trading 3% higher to USD 925, with resistances at USD 950 and 1,000. 
Ripple tumbled and tested the USD 0.50 support zone. It is currently correcting higher with major resistances at USD 0.65 and USD 0.70. Weekly supports are at USD 0.55 and USD 0.50. Other Altcoins Market Today
Altcoins are staging a substantial recovery after a bearish past week. Many coins are in the green zone (Status, Electroneum, Nucleus Vision and QTUM) with gains between 25-30%. The best performer is Status (SNT) with 32% gains. Overall, this could be a crucial week for bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies.

" Thursday, March 15th will go down in history as the day Lightning Network’s software lnd 0.4-beta version rolled out for the very first time. What does it mean? And is it already for everyone? Bitcoin has seen its share of problems throughout its relatively brief history, but mostly in the way it was simply not viable as an actual currency due to its high transaction fees and long confirmation times.  Lightning Network worked tirelessly to change that. The idea is that transacting and settling would be done off-blockchain, so the fees are low and thanks to the implementation of smart contracts for security, the payments can be instant - no waiting time for block confirmation. Other than these two, another important factor is its scalability, which is supposed to make it possible for millions to billions of transactions per second to take place across the network.  The beta release now makes available what investors and project leads say is the first thoroughly tested version of the tech to date. This now means that users can leverage lnd to send and receive Bitcoin and Litecoin off-blockchain.  Not for everyone “Bitcoin enthusiasts have gotten excited about this, merchants are excited about this. It feels like we’re right on the edge of mass cryptocurrency adoption,” Elizabeth Stark, Lightning Labs CEO, told Bloomberg.  However, she urges caution because a beta is far from a finished product. “This is still an early beta version aimed at developers and advanced users. As with any early software there will still be bugs. Users shouldn't be putting more money on Lightning right now than they are willing to lose,” Stark told Bitcoin Magazine. The target demographic for the release is developers and ""advanced users"" who are able to run a full node and use lnd’s command-line interface. The safety measures for the beta include limitations of how much people can send: this is now capped at around USD 1,400 worth per channel, or around USD 400 per payment. Spirits are high and excitement for reaching this milestone is not showing signs of retreating in the too-near future. Ben Davenport, CTO at BitGo and Lightning Network's investor, said to Coindesk, “It's something the entire community has been focused on and working towards for the better part of two years now. It's really the culmination of a lot of work by many people, not just Lightning Labs. ... We see it as a very important piece of the scaling solution for Bitcoin, and perhaps other digital currencies as well.” It was also revealed that Lightning Labs has raised USD 2.5 million from nearly a dozen investors, many of them big names in the industry such as Litecoin creator Charlie Lee; BitGo CTO Ben Davenport; Square and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey; former PayPal COO and Yammer founder David Sacks; Tesla and SpaceX angel investor Bill Lee; head of Square Capital and Square’s People Lead Jacqueline Reses; Eventbrite co-founder Kevin Hartz; Robinhood co-founder Vlad Tenev; and The Hive, Digital Currency Group and others. Lightning Network is not the only one working on ways to make Bitcoin more accessible as a payment system. SegWit, short for Segregated Witness, is also gaining traction as the number of transactions using it doubled to more than 30% of the total in the past month. Bitcoin transaction fees have plummeted in part thanks to this, but the total number of transactions has also declined. Both lnd and SegWit may become the main reasons for all-time lows in terms of fees, other than leading the crypto industry into a whole new era.",2018-03-16
" Yesterday’s decline in bitcoin price found support at USD 7,500. The price recovered by more than USD 500, but it seems like buyers are lacking momentum. Similarly, there was a decent recovery in all major altcoins such as ethereum, bitcoin cash and ripple. However, they seem to be facing many resistances on the upside, which are capping further recoveries. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price started an upward correction from the USD 7,650 low. BTC/USD broke the USD 8,000 resistance and traded towards the USD 8,400 level. The stated USD 8,400 level was a support earlier and this time it prevented the current upside move.
The pair retreated and is currently trading around 0.8% down to USD 8,100. An initial support on the downside is at USD 8,000. If the price fails to stay above USD 8,000, there could a retest of the last low of USD 7,650.
On the upside, the price has to move past the USD 8,400 and USD 8,500 resistance levels to recover further. Ethereum
Ethereum recovered from the USD 570 low, but it is struggling a great deal to stay above the USD 600-610 zone. ETH/USD traded as high as USD 621 and is currently down 2.1% to USD 595.
If the price has to recover towards USD 700, it must surpass the USD 625 and USD 630 resistance levels. On the downside, the last low near USD 570 is a short-term support followed by USD 560. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is under pressure since it failed to break the USD 950 resistance. BCH/USD is down 3.3% to USD 903 and it may continue to move down if it fails to stay above USD 900.
Ripple recovered a few points and moved above USD 0.70. However, the XRP/USD pair could not hold gains above USD 0.70 and is currently trading down 1.7% to USD 0.691. It may continue to decline towards the USD 0.68 level. Other Altcoins Market Today
Nexus coin did well today so far as the NXS price registered more than 20% gains to move above USD 2.15. A few other coins such as Aion, Dentacoin, DigixDAO and Lisk also did well and posted between 14-20% gains. Overall, the current market sentiment is still bearish. In order to start a fresh upside move, bitcoin price must move past the USD 8,500 resistance.",2018-03-16
" Yesterday, Google officially announced it is banning all ads related to cryptocurrencies starting June 2018. This greatly impacted the market since bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, ripple and almost all cryptocurrencies declined sharply. The market sentiment turned bearish and prices moved into a bearish region. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price tumbled and broke a couple of important support levels such as USD 9,000 and USD 8,600. The decline in BTC/USD was nasty as the pair even surpassed the USD 8,000 level.
The pair traded as low as USD 7,650 and it is currently down 9.2% to USD 8,180. It seems like the price is in a recovery mode, but it could face resistances on the upside such as USD 8,400 and USD 8,500.
Above USD 8,500, the broken supports at USD 8,800 and USD 9,000 are major barriers. On the downside, a decent support is forming around USD 8,000. If the price breaks down below USD 8,000, it could retest the recent low of USD 7,650. Ethereum
Ethereum declined heavily and broke the USD 650 and 600 support levels. The ETH/USD pair traded as low as USD 570 and it is currently correcting higher.
The pair is still trading 11% lower from the USD 687 high. Supports on the downside are seen as USD 600 and USD 570, and resistance are at USD 640 and 650. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is now trading well below the USD 1,000 support. BCH/USD traded towards the USD 850 support, recovered and is currently down 11% to USD 930.
Ripple extended declines and traded below the USD 0.65 support. XRP/USD seems to be under a lot of pressure and it could even test the USD 0.60 support level. Resistances are at USD 0.70 and USD 0.75. Other Altcoins Market Today
All other altcoins are under selling pressure and following the current slide. However, it seems like there is a short-term support base forming, considering the oversold levels. In order to recover substantially, bitcoin price must hold the USD 8,000 support. If BTC/USD fails to stay above the mentioned support, there are chances of further downsides toward USD 7500 and USD 7200. On the flip side, a break above the USD 8,500 resistance may perhaps improve the market sentiment.",2018-03-15
" There was no substantial move in major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin cash and Litecoin. It seems like prices are consolidating above key support levels. On the other hand, a few low market cap coins were able to attract investors and traded higher. Bitcoin
The past three sessions were mostly quiet since bitcoin price traded in a tiny range and did not make an upside move above USD 9,500 resistance. 
On the positive note, there was no downside break below the USD 9,000 and USD 8,800 support levels. As long as the pair is above the stated USD 8,800 support, it could slowly rise to USD 9,500.
Above USD 9,500, the USD 9,600 is a key resistance on the way to USD 10,000. On the flip side, a break below the USD 8,800 support may perhaps kick start a fresh downside wave towards USD 8,200. Ethereum
Ethereum seems to be struggling and it is currently trading below the USD 700 support. The current price action in ETH/USD points an increase in selling pressure from the USD 705-710 resistance region.
If the pair fails to stay above an important support at USD 680, there can be a sharp downside move. A recovery could start if ETH buyers succeed in pushing the price back above the USD 710 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash is trading slightly higher towards USD 1,050 and is currently gaining 1%. On the downside, the USD 1,020 support is acting as a major buy zone. To the topside, the USD 1,050 and 1,080 are key resistances.
Ripple remained below the USD 0.80 pivot level. It seems like the XRP/USD is consolidating below USD 0.80, and it is preparing for the next major move. Other Altcoins Market Today
Binance Coin (BNB) rose sharply today and gained more than 25%. BNB price traded above the USD 10 resistance, which is a positive sign. The main driving force behind the current rally was ‘Binance Chain’ announcement by the company. “As a public blockchain, Binance Chain will mainly focus on the transfer and trading of blockchain assets, as well as provide new possibilities for the future flow of blockchain assets,” according to Binance. Overall, the current market sentiment is neutral to bearish. Bitcoin price must stay above the USD 9,000 and 8,800 support levels to avoid further losses.",2018-03-14
" The recent Mt. Gox dump by Nobuaki Kobayashi, a Tokyo attorney and bankruptcy trustee for Mt Gox, is what some people believe brought the cryptocurrency market down recently - and he’s not even done yet. Kobayashi reportedly has another USD 1.9 billion to offload. But the next court hearing for the Mt. Gox bankruptcy is scheduled for September 18th, 2018, so it is likely that the attorney will not be able to get rid of the remaining coins until then - which could be a good thing for the Bitcoin price. Disclosures in Kobayashi's report on the Mt. Gox website suggest his Bitcoin sales since September fetched the equivalent of USD 10,105 on average. But the part that’s got everyone red-faced with rage is when Bitcoin investor Alistair Milne pointed out on Twitter that over half of the Bitcoin the attorney sold was transferred to an exchange on February 5. It was the day before Bitcoin hit a three-month low of close to USD 6,000 - so traders are concerned that he was effectively the one who brought it down. Exactly how unhappy users were with this situation is best seen on social media. People were venting on Reddit, with ideas what could have been done instead - like auctioning bitcoin off like it is often done in these cases, or release the same number of coins every day at a rate the market can absorb. In other threads, the top comments were on par with, “Just give the people their money in BTC and let them decide what to do with it. This is horsesh*t.” Any proceeds left after Mt. Gox's creditors are paid will go to Mark Karpeles, the founder of the infamous bitcoin exchange. This is another issue for the community, as it believes that Karpeles, facing charges of embezzlement and data manipulation and currently on bail from prison, should not reap any benefits from Mt. Gox’s fall. However, Chuck Jones, a contributor at Forbes, argues that blaming the Mt. Gox offload for the recent price drops makes no sense, saying that it seems “highly unlikely that this selling would have had much impact on the market.” He says that, “Since the sales were spread out over more than a month and at most represented 1.2% of a days trading volume, I find it hard to believe that Mt Gox created the decline in Bitcoin’s price.” He further added that the reason for the price drops could have been Bitcoin’s price “getting ahead of itself” or the fact that some countries went against crypto, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission coming out with statements in January. In short - his opinion is that everything except for this offload is the reason for the price drop. Meanwhile, Jim Edwards, an editor-in-chief of Business Insider UK, agrees: “That anger is misplaced, however. All they are complaining about is the fundamental condition of Bitcoin itself. They are complaining about the clearing price of supply and demand. They are ridiculous.” The truth, however, may just be in the middle of these warring opinions. Rare are the instances where there is a single, obvious reason for price fluctuations. It is usually a combination of common themes, such as public perception, panic selling and security breaches. In this case, it is highly unlikely that Mt Gox was the sole reason for the price drop - but arguing that it did not contribute to it doesn’t seem quite right either.",2018-03-13
" The crypto community never ceases to amaze with the number of ways they can find to laugh at Bitcoin Cash. Exactly why we’re mocking them this time remains unknown, but the Lil Windex song may have seemed proof that BCH is as much a joke as its theme song. So the newest topic is the claim that it has less transactions than Dogecoin. Twitter user @Whalepool points this out in a controversial tweet. Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency introduced as a “joke currency” to prove people would buy anything. While there are few mainstream commercial applications, it has gained traction as an Internet tipping system, in which social media users grant Dogecoin tips to other users for providing interesting or noteworthy content. Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, has been called the “real Bitcoin” by its endorsers in the community, being the result of a prolonged disagreement on how to handle the Bitcoin scalability problem. Bitcoin Cash fans argue that it is superior to the original Bitcoin because of its greater transaction speed, thus more likely to be used by merchants and for transactions. This has been dubbed the crypto “civil war”, where both sides claim that “this is what Satoshi would have wanted!”, despite nobody really knowing anything about Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. Their superiority doesn’t really show right now. The numbers at Bitinfocharts.com do not lie: in the past two months, only rarely did the number of Bitcoin Cash transactions exceed that of Dogecoin transactions, and the two cannot even compete with Litecoin most of the time. But before that, BCH traded at five times the number of Dogecoin transactions - a number that cannot be overseen, as the graph in the tweet was heavily taken out of full context. This could arguably be because Bitcoin Cash is significantly younger than the two - but its merit in transaction speed may be lost on traders as they obviously go for even the jokester’s Dogecoin more often than BCH. How Bitcoin’s “younger brother” will mark its comeback remains to be seen, as well as whether it will ever get out of its older brother’s shadow.",2018-03-13
" There was a downside correction initiated in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin cash and other major cryptocurrencies. Prices are down roughly 4.6% and are showing a few negative signs. It seems like there could be an extended downside correction before prices start an upward move. Bitcoin
Yesterday, bitcoin price failed to move above the USD 9,800 and 10,000 resistance levels. As a result, the BTC/USD pair started a downward move and trade below the USD 9,500 and 9,200 support levels.
It even traded below USD 9,000, but later recovered and is currently trading around 5.8% lower to USD 9,240. On the upside, the broken support levels at USD 9,300 and 9,500 may perhaps as resistances.
On the downside, the USD 9,000 level remains a major support. If the price closes below USD 9,000, there could be more declines towards USD 8,500. Ethereum
Ethereum was under pressure as it struggled to hold the USD 720 support. It declined and is currently finding it difficult to remain above the USD 700 support.
ETH/USD is trading 4.5% lower to USD 703. It may trade in a range above USD 675 for a few hours before it makes the next move. Below USD 700, the price may trade back towards USD 675. On the upside, a break above USD 725 is needed for a push towards USD 750. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash struggled a lot and declined 6.5% to USD 1,035. It failed not hold gains above the USD 1,100 and 1,080 supports and declined. Going forward, BCH/USD has to stay above USD 1,000 to avoid further losses.

" This past week, we saw a major decline in almost all major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin cash, Litecoin and Neo. Later, the market stabilized and started recovering. Bitcoin corrected higher after forming a base above USD 8,400. Similarly, altcoins recovered sharply as the market sentiment improved during the past few hours. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is currently trading 13.8% higher from the USD 8,532 low. More importantly, the BTC/USD pair is now trading above the USD 9,500 support, which could ignite more upsides.
On the upside, the price is facing an immediate resistance at USD 10,000. A push above the mentioned resistance may perhaps boost the bullish market sentiment and the price could trade towards USD 10,500. 
On the downside, the USD 9,500 level is a major support. A break below USD 9,500 will most likely push the price back towards USD 9,000. Ethereum
Ethereum gained traction after forming a base above the USD 650 level. ETH/USD recovered and traded above the USD 700 resistance. It is currently up 7.8% to USD 738. 
It seems to be struggling to break the USD 750 resistance. A break above the USD 750 level may call for further gains towards the USD 800 level. On the downside, supports are at USD 700 and 680. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash was one of the best performers as it recovered by around 14% today and it is currently trading at USD 1,130. It has to clear a strong resistance at USD 1,150 to continue its recovery.
Ripple failed to capitalize and it seems to be struggling to move past USD 0.85. XRP/USD is currently trading around 3.8% higher to USD 0.829 and is facing a major resistance at USD 0.85. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today, IOStoken,  a decentralized internet of services platform, gained heavy bids and surged by around 22.6%. IOST price broke the USD 0.020 resistance and is currently trading in a positive zone.

" Out of all the rappers named after cleaning products, Lil Windex is perhaps the most successful one. The inscrutable rapper is believed to hail from British Columbia, although very little is truly known about him, other than that he once said, “I idolize birds.” He is the one to thank for the Bitcoin Ca$h song that seems to have the makings of a viral hit, if only because of how strange it is. Over three verses, Bitcoin Ca$h tells the story of a young Lil Windex, probably fictionalized, who goes from a dead-end job cleaning windows, to being hard-sold by a guy in a cafe who explains the details (and we mean absolute details!) of crypto mining, to obtaining ludicrous personal wealth. Since showing his crypto stash off would not look too great in a music video, he is throwing around fiat currency, we’re guessing after he cashed his BCH out. His portfolio remains a mystery, but he does take a hard stance on Bitcoin core - the BCH community’s nickname for the original Bitcoin - saying that, “Hey f*ck Bitcoin core. You’re just a buncha names. We the BCH gang. We run this game.” The only thing that’s telling us is that he certainly doesn’t own any BTC. If you’re wondering whether it’s a joke or serious, or was it sponsored by BCH supporters - we don’t know either. Nobody does, and we’re not even sure Lil Windex knows. Take it as you will - serious or not, you’ll probably find yourself humming it throughout the day. You wouldn’t be the only one.",2018-03-09
" Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin cash, Litecoin, Neo and all other major altcoins tumbled during the past few sessions. There was hardly any recovery in the market following yesterday’s decline. At present, sellers are still in control and there are no signs of a short-term recovery. The current move is mostly a technical breakdown, which could extend in the near term. Bitcoin
Bitcoin price is about to register one of the worst weeks of 2018. It is down around 25% this week and it recently broke a couple of important support levels such as USD 10,000 and 9,000.
BTC/USD pair is currently down 13.5% to USD 8,643. Today’s low was USD 8,329 and the current correction wave is struggling to gain momentum. It seems like the price may resume its downside in the near term and it could even break the recent low of USD 8,329.
On the downside, the next major support is at USD 8,000. On the upside, resistances are at USD 8,880 and 9,000. Ethereum
Ethereum followed bitcoin and declined sharply below the USD 650 level. ETH/USD traded towards USD 640 before starting a recovery. The pair is currently losing 12.7% and is struggling near the USD 666 level.
On the downside supports are at USD 650 and 640. A break below the USD 640 support may perhaps push the price towards the USD 600 level. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash traded close to the USD 900 level and is currently trading well below the USD 1,000 level. BCH/USD declined 13.2% to USD 956. It remains in a bearish zone as long as it is below USD 1,000.
Ripple tumbled and moved below the USD 0.80 level. XRP/USD’s struggle to move higher continues and the current market decline has increased bearish pressures. Other Altcoins Market Today
No cryptocurrency registered gains today. All altcoins are trading in the red zone and they remain at a risk of more losses.

" Bitcoin and almost all altcoins saw an increase in selling pressure during the past few sessions. The main reason was phishing and attempted stealing incident on a major cryptocurrency exchange – Binance. However, the exchange released a statement mentioning that all funds are safe. Later, the company resumed withdrawals as well.   Bitcoin
Bitcoin price dropped heavily and broke a major support area at USD 10,000. It even surpassed the USD 9,600 support and traded towards the USD 9,400 level. 
Later, the market calmed down and BTC/USD recovered. However, the pair is still down around 5.3% to USD 9,920. It has to move back above the USD 10,000 level to recover further.
If the pair fails to move above USD 10,000, it could retest the USD 9,600 support. On the upside, above USD 10,000, the price may perhaps move towards USD 10,500. Ethereum
Ethereum traded sharply lower and broke the USD 750 support. It traded close to the USD 700 level before starting an upside correction.
ETH/USD is currently trading 3.4% down to USD 758. It may continue to move higher, but it will most likely find a strong selling interest near a major resistance at USD 800 (previous support). On the downside, the USD 740 and 720 levels are decent supports. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash fell below the USD 1,110 support and traded towards USD 1,030. However, BCH/USD also recovered recently like bitcoin, and it is currently down 5.1% to USD 1,090. It must settle back above USD 1,110 to start a fresh upside wave.
Ripple remained in a bearish zone and it settled below USD 0.90. XRP/USD could resume it downside in the short term towards the USD 0.80 and 0.75 levels. Other Altcoins Market Today
There was hardly any major mover today so far. The only coin in the green zone is NEM, a smart asset blockchain. XEM price is currently trading around 9.4% higher and is placed above the USD 0.3250 resistance. To sum up, Binance phishing and attempted stealing incident sparked heavy selling. However, the market is now stable, but damage is already done. It will take a lot of strength from bitcoin buyers to push the price back in the green zone.",2018-03-08
" Having seen the prices go close to USD 20,000 and back down again, many have decided that Bitcoin mining may be a more lucrative business than trading. However, mining is expensive and as more people set up rigs and more coins are mined, it only gets harder and pricier. Exactly how pricy, EliteFixtures.com found out by doing a worldwide study. The subsidiary of Crescent Electric Supply Company, an American distributor of electrical hardware, looked at the cost to mine one Bitcoin in 115 different countries based on average electricity rates according to government data, utility company data, and/or reports. On another interesting note, it depends on the rig exactly how quickly a single coin can be mined. According to their calculations, this ranges from 548.56 days to 2194.22 days. The most expensive country by far is South Korea. For mining a single coin, you would need to cash out USD 26,170 - hardly a good trade-off. Niue, an island country in the South Pacific Ocean, comes in second, with a significantly cheaper rate of “only” USD 17,566. In third place is Bahrain, where you would need USD 16,773, fourth place belongs to the Solomon Islands standing at USD 16,209, and number five are the Cook Islands with USD 15,861 - still not worth its value on the current market. After these staggering numbers, the cheapest countries look like a delight to live in: the cheapest by far is Venezuela, with only USD 531 needed for that one coin. But, as EliteFixtures.com explains, “Their electricity rates are heavily subsidized by the government, leading to incredibly low prices.” Second cheapest are Trinidad and Tobago at USD 1,190, followed by Uzbekistan and its USD 1,788. Europe’s only truly cheap country is Ukraine, where mining a single coin costs USD 1,852, and then it’s back to Asia with Myanmar, where it costs USD 1,983 to quench your FOMO (fear of missing out). Whether you decide to mine or trade may depend on your country of residence. If you’re from South Korea, you would need a miracle on the market to ever break even. But if you’re from Venezuela, go for it - unless you’re already into petro.",2018-03-07
" Bitcoin saw an increase in the bearish pressure, which pushed the price below a crucial support at USD 11,000. It sparked a bearish wave in altcoins as well, and cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin cash, Litecoin and Neo registered healthy declines. There was no particular fundamental reason and it mostly seems to be a technical breakdown below USD 11,000 in BTC/USD.  Bitcoin
Yesterday, we discussed how bitcoin price was consolidating above a key support at USD 11,000. Later, BTC/USD faced an increased selling pressure and the pair broke the mentioned support.
As a result, the pair is down 6.3% to USD 10,550. It even broke the USD 10,600 support, which is a bearish sign. The next major support on the downside is at USD 10,200, followed by USD 10,000.
On the upside, the broken support at USD 11,000 may perhaps act as a strong resistance if the price corrects higher during the coming sessions. Ethereum
Ethereum also followed bitcoin and tumbled by around 6.9% to USD 787. It broke a major support area at USD 800, which ignited further losses.
An immediate support on the downside is at USD 780. Below the mentioned USD 780, the next target for sellers could be USD 750. On the upside, the USD 800 and 820 levels have turned into resistances. Bitcoin Cash and Ripple
Bitcoin cash tumbled 7.10% to USD 1,150. It seems like bitcoin dragged a few major altcoins along with it, and it may extend further. The next major support on the downside is at USD 1,100.
Ripple also declined by around 7% and moved back below USD 0.9500. XRP/USD could extend losses toward the USD 0.85 and 0.80. Other Altcoins Market Today
Today’s best performer so far is Iconomi, a digital asset management platform. ICN price moved up by more than 25% to USD 2.15. The main reason was the announcement to support fourteen new countries for Tier 2 Verification - Angola, Australia, Bolivia, Dominican Republic, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Namibia, Pakistan, Philippines, Senegal, Taiwan and Thailand.  Overall, the current market sentiment is slightly negative and if bitcoin price fails to recover from USD 10,500, there can be more downsides in the near term.",2018-03-07
" On August 24, 2017, the much awaited SegWit upgrade to the Bitcoin network was activated and with it came the promise of lower transaction fees and faster confirmation times. Now, six months after the activation, SegWit adoption is on the rise and the benefits of this network upgrade are finally being felt by active bitcoin users.  Currently, over a quarter of bitcoin transactions are SegWit transactions. This is more than twice as many as in October 2017 and the number is on the rise according to data compiled by SegWit.Party. This is translating into much lower transaction fees and a substantial increase in transaction speeds than we witnessed in the second half of 2017.  The increase in adoption is thanks to the growing number of bitcoin service providers who are implemented the network upgrade.  Moreover, version 0.16.0 of Bitcoin Core, the standard software client of the bitcoin network, was released on February 26 to provide full support for SegWit in the wallet and user interfaces, which has helped to boost SegWit adoption.  As a result of the increasing SegWit adoption, the number of unconfirmed transactions has dropped dramatically for first time in four months. Furthermore, average bitcoin transaction fees dropped from a high of over USD 50 in December to a current price of around USD 3.  It has to be said though, that the number of confirmed transaction did not solely drop due to the increase in SegWit adoption but also because outstanding bitcoin buy orders were clogging the network at the end of 2017 when bitcoin was close to its USD 20,000 all-time high and because of bitcoin’s price drop, fewer people are buying bitcoin now than in late 2017.  Nonetheless, in light of the slow transactions times and high fees we witnessed in November and December of last year, this is a welcome sight to the active bitcoin community who actually use bitcoin as a spending currency and to send money abroad.  Furthermore, the rise in SegWit adoption is giving a clear signal that the bitcoin community wants to see bitcoin succeed, not only as a digital-gold like investment asset but as the world’s leading alternative currency.  *** Background Segregated Witness, more commonly referred to as SegWit, is an upgrade to the Bitcoin network that has been activated in August 2017 to provide a solution to bitcoin’s scalability challenges and to eliminate the issue of transaction malleability. 
SegWit aids bitcoin’s scalability by increasing the effective block size without increasing the block size limit. Instead, SegWit removes signature data in each block to increase the number of bitcoin transactions that can be put into each block. This leads to the Bitcoin blockchain being able to process more transactions per second that before. 
Prior to February, dozens of bitcoin wallets and exchanges - including Electrum, Ledger, LocalBitcoins, and Wirex - have already implemented SegWit much to the appreciation of their customers. 
Bitcoin wallet and exchange Luno’s SegWit announced SegWit support on February 14 and popular digital currency exchange Bitfinex made its announcement on February 20. 
On February 23, Coinbase announced that it is implementing SegWit on both its Coinbase wallet and its GDAX exchange.

" Curtis Jackson just went from alleged Bitcoin millionaire to zero, reported celebrity news site The Blast. Known by his stage name 50 Cent and affectionately called Fiddy, the rapper filed documents in his bankruptcy case admitting that “recent media reports have falsely stated” that he failed to disclose alleged interests in Bitcoin to his Bankruptcy Court, but in reality he has “never owned, and does not own, a Bitcoin account or any Bitcoins, and to the best of his knowledge, none of his companies had a Bitcoin account from 2014 to the present.” Last month, TMZ reported that the rapper “discovered” he had made millions thanks to letting people buy his 2014 album Animal Ambition using Bitcoin. Not only did he not correct the reports, he also encouraged them through a now-deleted photo on his Instagram account where he said he was feeling “proud of himself” in the caption. As to why, in the court documents obtained by The Blast, Fiddy explains: “As a general matter, so long as a press story is not irreparably damaging to my image or brand, I usually do not feel the need to publicly deny the reporting. This is particular true when I feel the press report in question is favorable to my image or brand, even if the report is based on a misunderstanding of the facts or contains outright falsehoods.” This is not the first time he claimed to have more money than he does:  in 2016, he told a judge that the cash in one of his Instagram photos was ""prop money.""",2018-02-27
" Bitcoin fees are down from USD 26 to USD 3 on average, to a collective sigh of relief from the entire community. It fell on USD 0.79 on Sunday, having peaked at USD 34 on December 23. Once, Bitcoin’s very low transaction fees were one of its selling points - until they soared in December 2017, showing that the prices are not the only volatile thing about Bitcoin. The climb of fees in late 2017 had many shying away from Bitcoin as a payment system; for example, Valve, an American video game developer and digital distribution company, stopped accepting Bitcoin on Steam. Bitpay, a bitcoin payment service provider, set a minimum transaction size to USD 100 - before promptly lowering it to USD 5 due to customer uproar - and Stripe, a payment processor, stopped accepting Bitcoin payments for customers in January due to the fact that thanks to high fees, there were “fewer and fewer use cases” for it. Some other companies switched to other cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin Cash, which was mostly created in the first place to keep fees lower. So the simplest answer to decreasing fees would be the decreasing number of transactions. A handy chart from Bitinfocharts.com shows the average fees: While another from Blockchain.info shows the number of transactions:  When compared, it seems that the fees and the prices shot up simultaneously, but also fell together. This is easily explained by people being willing to pay top dollar to get their Bitcoins into exchanges to sell them at the high prices of December. As the prices fell, so did people’s interest, and transaction fees simply followed suit. The decrease in transactions, however, is another matter entirely. There is a realistic possibility that exorbitant fee prices have forced large transaction processors to implement a technology called “batching”. It means including many payments to many different recipients into a single Bitcoin transaction - thus leaving more space on the blockchain. That is exactly what crypto exchange ShapeShift did, according to their announcement.  Mike Belshe, BitGo, a Blockchain security company, engineer, said to Coindesk that, “even if just one large exchange started batching transactions, it could have a huge impact on the overall transaction load.” Another solution to this problem that has already occurred to some was to simply raise the block size in Bitcoin - which produced Bitcoin Cash after the group did not get their way. Since the forking, what remained behind was the “small block” faction, which will fight tooth and claw to find a way around the problem without raising the block size. So they’ve focused on a technological upgrade called Segregated Witness (known as SegWit in the industry) that separates cryptographic signatures from the rest of the blockchain data, thus effectively increasing block size. Rolling out the necessary changes for SegWit takes time, though -  six months after the upgrade went into effect, only about 14% of Bitcoin transactions use the new format. There hasn't been much of a recent increase in SegWit use either. For the past several months, only about 10-14% of transactions, according to SegWit tracking site SegWit Party. Resurgence of Bitcoin fees is a real possibility. If the current trend continues, a new rise in the price might bring higher fees as well - so low prices right now may be a blessing in disguise. But for now, lower fees might set a new standard, thus restricting them from rising to previous heights.",2018-02-23
" Following new guidelines from Finland’s Treasury published on Tuesday, Finnish authorities are now trying to devise a means to store 2,000 Bitcoins confiscated since 2016. According to Bloomberg, the Treasury guidelines prohibit authorities from storing the stash - currently worth around USD 22.8 million - on virtual exchanges or services. Instead, they are to be kept off the internet, in a cold storage. Finnish authorities have declined to comment on how the confiscated coins have been kept up to now.  According to the customs office in Helsinki, most of the coins have been confiscated in dozens of raids conducted since 2016. In this case, the Finnish government prohibits authorities from considering any crypto asset as currency; rather, it is defined as “an asset that, as a rule, can’t be used or accepted as a means of payment or as an investment,” according to the Treasury document. After a binding court ruling on the confiscation of these Bitcoins, the Finnish state will convert the assets into euros at public auctions, since commercial exchanges can be “untrustworthy and opaque,” says the Treasury. Confiscated cryptocurrency being auctioned off by the state is not without precedent. In December 2017, during an undercover bust of an underground crime network, Bulgaria has seized enough Bitcoin to pay off a fifth of its national debt - a stunning 213,519 Bitcoins, at the time valued at USD 3.5 billion.  Following this case, on January 22nd, the US Marshal’s Office auctioned off 3,813 Bitcoins seized in criminal investigations, the sum of which amounted to nearly USD 50 million on commercial exchanges.",2018-02-21
" Calvin Ayre, a Bitcoin and gambling multimillionaire, is building a USD 100 million five-star resort on Antigua funded by his own crypto-profits made from the rise in value of Bitcoin in which he was an early investor. “This resort will attract a totally new market segment of tourism on the island — successful wellness-seekers who also want to have fun. The property will not be an all-inclusive destination. Instead, its amenities will be available to residents of Antigua and Barbuda and visitors alike,” according to the press release.  Ayre is a Bitcoin Cash (BCH) supporter, and this cryptocurrency will be accepted at the resort, at point of sale terminals on the property and through its online booking engine. His crypto-related involvement does not end here by any measure. In January 2018, he revealed he has dedicated significant amounts of his investment funds towards creating a BCH mining operation. The mining facility will dedicate its power to the Bitcoin Cash blockchain only. Ayre is a Canadian-Antiguan entrepreneur based in Antigua and Barbuda, and the founder of the Ayre Group and Bodog entertainment brand.

" Bitcoin’s design might have a fatal flaw in that it could not handle a liquidity shock due to its decentralized nature, JPMorgan said in a recent note, Business Insider reported. In a liquidity crisis, central banks simply print more money to make up for a decline in lending and spending in the private sector. Since there is no institution which sets the rate for Bitcoin creation, such a solution would be impossible. JPMorgan states in their note: “The ability to provide adequate liquidity is a hallmark of a well-functioning market, but more so during times of crisis. One benefit of fiat money is that it can be used to provide emergency liquidity from the outside. This is the role central banks play as the lender-of-last resort.” In the other corner of the ring, Bitcoin fans argue that JPMorgan assumes that this way of patching up the economy is actually good.  Aaron Lasher, the chief marketing officer at Breadwallet, a bitcoin wallet company, asks why there is any need for emergency liquidity in the first place. In his opinion, it all comes down to the fact that fiat currencies are centralized and thus printable at the whim of a certain group of people - central bankers. These bankers face no risks for themselves - they can always print more money to back themselves up, with the consequence of inflation. Arthur Hayes, the chief executive at BitMEX, a P2P bitcoin trading platform, points out that money printing is hardly the best solution for economies at the brink of collapse - as Zimbabwe and Venezuela can testify. He adds, “Money printing delays the inevitable. Without the ability to print base money at all, any institutional that extended credit would be evaluated by the market on its ability to responsibly originate loans.” Although printing money as a last reserve is a viable solution in a controlled environment, like the US did after the recent financial crisis, Zimbabwe and Venezuela are examples of how it can go wrong for everyone else.",2018-02-16
" The market sentiment improved further and it seems like buyers are slowly taking charge. There was no negative news or development, which helped cryptocurrencies and lifted the prices of bitcoin, Ethereum, litecoin, ripple and bitcoin cash.

" Five years ago, a 26-year-old Bitcoin miner named Matthew Moody died in a plane crash during an observational flight. His father Michael has been looking for a way to access his late son’s crypto wallet, hosted by blockchain.info, for the past three years without much success, Bloomberg reports. Michael Moody has no way to access these funds without the private keys, or a special code needed to access the funds, and there is no way to find out even how much is in that wallet. Moody added that young people “need to be better educated about the steps needed to be taken to ensure their investments are properly secured, both for themselves and for future heirs.” On the topic of how to pass down your cryptocurrency after death, Peter Henning, a professor at Wayne State University Law School and veteran SEC and Justice Department lawyer, said, “My bet is that ICOs [Initial Coin Offering], when issued by a company, they’re going to be considered securities. If they are securities, then just like stock or bonds you can put them in your will and pass them down.” But this may be some time in coming. In the meantime, the crypto exchange CoinBase offers an alternative solution: the company asks for documents such as a death certificate and will in order to transfer the assets. But the idea of somebody else being in custody of your crypto is not in line with its idea of decentralization. The problem of death through accident, like in Moody’s case, still remains. It is highly unlikely that someone in their 20s or 30s would have a will ready in case something happened to them - and even then, adding your crypto wallet keys to the will may slip your mind. This way, the keys are lost - perhaps forever.",2018-02-14

During the upside move, BCH/USD broke an important resistance at USD 1,000 to set the pace for more gains. The past two sessions were bullish on bitcoin as the cryptocurrency started a fresh upside move after correcting lower towards the USD 7,500 support. During the recent upside move, the price broke the USD 8,000 and 8,200 resistance levels to set the pace for more gains. Technically, bitcoin was up more than 4% and is currently trading above USD 8,500. If it continues to move higher, it could easily move past USD 8,800.

The overall market sentiment is negative and digital assets may decline further in the near term. Today in India, the Union Budget 2018 was announced. Many investors and traders were eyeing the budget to know about the Government’s stand on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.  The finance minister made it clear that the digital currencies are not Legal Tender and the Government will take all measures to eliminate the use of bitcoins in financing illegitimate activities. There was no mention of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies Ban in India. However, this is not a very good sign for investors in India since the Government is not clarifying doubts whether trading is legal or not. There is also no clarity on tax structure for bitcoins and cryptocurrencies. On the positive side, Suwon District Court in South Korea has recognized that bitcoin has economic value. Moreover, Samsung recently confirmed that they are working on developing hardware for cryptocurrency mining.  In Arizona, it seems like there are positive developments as lawmakers are pushing a proposal to allow residents in Arizona to pay their taxes in bitcoins. In the altcoins arena, a document was released by the Grayscale Investments Company, which is one the biggest cryptocurrencies asset management firm. According to the document, Zcash token may perhaps rise to USD 60,000 in 2025. Overall, the marketremains in the red, with BTC/USD trading below the most important support at USD 10,000. It is currently trading lower by 6.9% to USD 9,511. The next major support on the downside is at USD 9,200, followed by the USD 9,000 level. ETH/USD is trading with a stable bias, but if the market continues to decline, Ether could trade below USD 1,080. Looking at the other digital currencies, bitcoin cash is down 8.5% to USD 1,370. The next major support for BCH/USD is at USD 1,300. Other altcoins such as LTC/USD declined toward USD 151 and is currently under a lot of pressure. NEO/USD is down 10% to USD 130.",2018-02-01
" The Suwon District Court in South Korea has recognized that bitcoin has economic value and therefore can be confiscated, Chosun News reported. The case was that of Ahn, 34, who was arrested in May last year and convicted of operating an illegal pornography site with approximately 1.2 million members. Ahn pocketed c. USD 1.78m in membership fees. While arresting him, the Southern Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency confiscated his 216 Bitcoins (c. USD 2m) from an online wallet which received some fees from the site. Only last year, during the same case, the same court ruled that Bitcoin is not subject to confiscation. The court was quoted as saying, “It is not appropriate to confiscate Bitcoins because they are in the form of electronic files without physical entities, unlike cash […] Virtual currency can not assume an objective standard value,” by the Kyunghyang Shinmun news outlet. According to Chosun News, the court now said that, “the crime profit concealment law does not restrict the criminal income to the goods but the cash, the deposit, the stock, and other property with economic value. Bitcoin can be changed into money through an exchange. It can be used as a means of payment through merchants, so it should be regarded as having economic value.” This is the first time Bitcoin’s economic value has been recognized by a Korean court.",2018-02-01
" The Free Software Foundation has recently received a 91.45 BTC (roughly USD 1 million) donation from the anonymous founder of the Pineapple Fund, the Foundation tweeted to express their thanks. The Free Software Foundation is a nonprofit organization striving for computer user freedom  to study the code, distribute, create, and modify computer software, as opposed to leaving them subject to the whim of those who create the software they use.  The Pineapple Fund is a philanthropic project by an anonymous individual nicknamed “Pine” to give away 5,057 Bitcoins to charity (valued at USD 86 million in December 2017, when the fund was announced on Reddit). Pine claims to be among the 250 largest holders of Bitcoin in the world. The fund has already donated over USD 34 million to 41 organizations, all in BTC, to organizations providing clean water to people in Sub-Saharan Africa, to a basic income experiment that will help rural Kenyans trapped in extreme poverty, to a non-profit created to build an Internet library, to support universal health care, research and treatments for aging, education for disadvantaged children worldwide, and to provide stable housing worldwide. The fund is currently matching any donations sent to MAPS, an organization supporting research for treatments for mental illness, and to the Erowid Center, an educational organization providing free information on psychoactive plants and drugs. Donations sent to MAPS will be matched up to USD 4 million, while donations sent to the Erowid Center will be matched up to USD 250,000 until March 10.",2018-01-31
" Electronics giant Samsung has begun manufacturing ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) chips designed for Bitcoin mining for a Chinese client, according to the local media reports. The publication states that the process for the development of semiconductor ASIC was completed last year, and that mass production has started in January. “We are in the middle of a foundry business that is being supplied to a virtual money mining company in China,” a Samsung spokesperson confirmed, adding that the company was unsure how profitable the venture would prove to be. Taiwanese hardware giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company supplies the ASIC chips needed for cryptocurrency mining to Bitmain, a China-based Bitcoin mining company, and is the only other major semiconductor manufacturer to form a partnership with a Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer. Last year, Samsung used 40 old Galaxy phones to create a Bitcoin mining rig as part of an “upcycling” initiative intended to persuade customers to find new use cases for their old phones. The rig, of course, was mostly a curiosity, but it is an interesting development given that, according to this new information, Samsung was secretly developing ASIC chips at the time. This shows that chip manufacturers like Samsung are well aware of the prevalent use of their GPUs (graphics processing unit) for cryptocurrency mining by end users, and might be even focusing it with new designs. For example, only a few days ago, it was revealed that Nvidia was trying to prevent crypto miners from getting their hands on their products, in order to protect their gamer clientele.",2018-01-31
" Two Bitcoin traders were robbed at gunpoint at their home in rural England when armed criminals forced them to carry out cryptocurrency transfers, the Telegraph reported. Danny Aston and his girlfriend Amy Jay, who jointly run a cryptocurrency trading company called Aston Digital Currencies Ltd, were forced to digitally transfer an unspecified amount of Bitcoin by four men who broke into their house. The incident took place on January 22, but was first reported almost a week later. The Mail on Sunday reported that the men tied up a woman and kept a baby outside in a pram while forcing Mr Aston to transfer the Bitcoin.  According to The Times newspaper, Aston has carried out more than 100,000 cryptocurrency trades with more than 16,300 different accounts, and offers trading tips and analysis online. The publication also reported that some of his clients referred to him by his real name, which may have helped thieves identify him. A police spokesman said, ""The investigation is in its early stages; however, initial enquiries suggest this may be a targeted incident.” The anonymity of Bitcoin will make it almost impossible to trace, but Guy Shone, chief executive of Explain The Market, said: “[...] depending on how much [Bitcoin] they have, these coins are like being in possession of a rare painting. Trying to exchange large amounts for [fiat] money without alerting suspicion will be very difficult.’  All public profiles of Danny Aston have since been deleted and, according to their neighbors, the couple now seems to be hiding at a secret address since the robbery occurred.",2018-01-29
" Coming as perhaps the most blatant sign that the world is currently in the grip of a cryptocurrency mania, the sci-fi action-role-playing-game Imperatum gave itself a ""Bitcoin Mode"" as part of its latest update.  Made by indie developers Pro Social Games, the title now provides its players with the option of linking its fundamental dynamics to real-time movements in the price of bitcoin. With Bitcoin Mode chosen at the start of a new game, players will find that a rise (or fall) in bitcoin's value will confront them with more (or less) ""loot"" and with more (or less) fearsome enemies. Summing up these new features, Pro Social Games' founder Andrew Stafford told Cryptonews.com what would happen if bitcoin should ever crash to zero USD per coin: ""If this happened the enemies would drop to the lowest possible level, which in our case is 1."" Asked whether a bitcoin value of USD 100,000 would make the game ridiculously hard, Stafford replies: ""Yes, enemies would scale to the highest possible level in the game and would make life tough for the player."" While the current volatility of bitcoin could therefore make for some interesting gaming, it's clear that much of the rationale behind the decision to add a Bitcoin Mode is promotional.  ""This is the first step in drawing the interest of the crypto community,"" Stafford explains. ""Blockchain is a very new thing to a lot of people and Bitcoin is the big name that draws them."" Pro Social wouldn't be the first company to exploit bitcoin or the blockchain's reputation for commercial gain: in December, the shares of Long Island Ice Tea Corp. rose by 432% in a single day after the American soft-drinks company changed its name to Long Blockchain Corporation. That said, Stafford also confirmed that the developer's interest in cryptocurrency isn't focused only on PR.  ""We have big plans in the works for the implementation of our own cryptocurrency that drops in game,"" he reveals. How such a cryptocurrency might work wasn't outlined, yet Stafford was able to give some hint as to why Pro Social would be developing its own cryptocurrency rather than deepening its relationship with bitcoin.  ""I do not see a future for Bitcoin,"" he admits. ""Bitcoin doesn't do anything the best and will eventually be supplanted by gen. 2, 3, 4 cryptocurrencies. Whether this happens this year or not is up for debate.""",2018-01-29
" Bitcoin and altcoins rose during the past 2-3 days and moved into a positive zone. However, cryptocurrencies faced sellers on the topside and started a downside correction. On the fundamental front, it seems like trouble is mounting on Tether. The company recently confirmed that their relationship with audit firm Friedman LLP has ended. In a statement, the company mentioned: 
“We confirm that the relationship with Friedman is dissolved.  Given the excruciatingly detailed procedures Friedman was undertaking for the relatively simple balance sheet of Tether, it became clear that an audit would be unattainable in a reasonable time frame.” “We confirm that the relationship with Friedman is dissolved.  Given the excruciatingly detailed procedures Friedman was undertaking for the relatively simple balance sheet of Tether, it became clear that an audit would be unattainable in a reasonable time frame.” It all started with a post from an anonymous blogger, who raised concerns about USDT. There are rising alarms whether every USDT token indeed have a dollar sitting in bank accounts. The blogger Bitfinex’ed, summarized the post saying: 
“Bitfinex will never submit to a third party audit, because they know what they will find. This could have also been a factor in their refusal to go through a traditional bankruptcy. The bankruptcy trustee would have found out Bitfinex could have been cooking the books since the day they started and the losses would have been way more significant.” “Bitfinex will never submit to a third party audit, because they know what they will find. This could have also been a factor in their refusal to go through a traditional bankruptcy. The bankruptcy trustee would have found out Bitfinex could have been cooking the books since the day they started and the losses would have been way more significant.” If all the ongoing drama continues, there are chances that bitcoin price could decline. USDT has a lot of weightage in trading cryptocurrencies. If something bad happens down the line, then altcoins could face a lot of selling pressure. On the other hand, South African Revenue Service (Sars) said to be working in tax structure for bitcoins and digital currencies with their plans to examine cryptocurrencies space much more cautiously. In addition, Bonnie Cheung, a venture partner at 500 Startups thinks that bitcoin is boring. While speaking to Bloomberg, Cheung compared bitcoin with a Motorola cell phone. She added: “The three key areas are right now scalability if you look at throughput Visa does about on average 2,000 transactions per second. PayPal can do around 500, bitcoin it’s seven, ethereum maxing out at about 50.” Clearly, she is referring to capacity and scalability problems of bitcoin. BTCUSD was down from the USD 12,200 high and is currently trading lower by 4.10% to USD 11,420. Ethereum too suffered losses and was down by 2.65% to trade near USD 1,200. However, ETHUSD remains supported on the downside near the USD 1,180 and USD 1,160 support levels.  Bitcoin price is currently under pressure and there is a possibility of it testing the USD 11,100 support zone. Below USD 11,100, the price could break the USD 11,000 level for further declines. On the upside, there is a strong resistance near USD 12,000 and USD 12,100. Other altcoins such as litecoin and ripple started a downside correction after an upside move. LTCUSD is currently down by 2.9% at USD 183.  Overall, the market is in a short-term correction mode. However, BTCUSD must stay above USD 11,100 to avoid further slides.",2018-01-29
" Cryptocurrencies were under pressure during the past few hours and bitcoin price traded below the USD 11,000 support. Ethereum also faced selling pressure and traded below the USD 1,050 support. Commenting on regulation issues, one of the most senior financial policymakers in the US raised concerns over the recent rise in bitcoin price and people using it in criminal activities -""illicit activity"". Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, US treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, stated that ""we want to make sure that they're not used for illicit activities”. Similarly, Theresa May raised issues of rising use of cryptocurrencies. The US follows strict rules and laws to ensure that exchanges in the US which are offering trades in bitcoin and digital currencies follow all important anti-money laundering rules. However, there are many countries which are still very far in cracking down bitcoin and altcoins.  Bitcoin price was in trouble today as it traded lower by more than 6.8% to USD 10,580. It broke an important support at USD 11,000, which has cleared the path for more declines. ETH also was under pressure along with NEO and LTC. Litecoin was down by 6.4% to trade near USD 170. Bitcoin cash also suffered losses as it traded close to the USD 1500 level.  In a surprising statement, cryptocurrency 'Oracle' Lingham in an interview to CNBC stated that he thinks bitcoin cash may overtake bitcoin in the near future. He added saying: ""When I look at it from the product standpoint, I think the greater demand is for peer-to-peer cash than for digital gold”. In altcoins arena,ICON Mainnet Launch was a huge success. ICX is one of the most talked about altcoins lately. One of the other altcoins, DigixDAO, gained heavily today. DGD was up by around 48% to trade above the USD 275 level. Overall, the market is struggling to gain bullish strength. The recent bounce in bitcoin and Ethereum seems to be fading. If prices fail to recover during the coming sessions, there can be more declines in BTC/USD toward USD 10,000, and ETH/USD could trade below USD 1,000.",2018-01-26
" Last month, Bitcoin was used in a freight deal sent from Rostov, Russia to Samsun, Turkey, according to a firm called Prime Shipping Foundation (PSF). Possibly, this is the first freight deal done in a cryptocurrency, per Bloomberg. PSF is trying to develop “a cross-border payment system that’s easier and faster than what’s available now”, Bloomberg reported, citing PSF’s Chief Executive Officer Ivan Vikulov.  Vikulov hopes the company’s trial can lead to processing freight deals more fluidly through cryptocurrency usage. During the research and development of the project, PSF has partnered with Quorum Capital and Interchart LLC, a ship management service. According to Bloomberg, “Prime Shipping Foundation is seeking to get a banking license in Gibraltar, one of the most crypto-friendly jurisdictions”, in order to make conversions between fiat and crypto easier. Because of crypto’s market volatility, Vikulov said they would allow hedging. They are developing their own cryptocurrency, with plans to raise funds for it mid-2018. This comes soon after the announcement that Louis Dreyfus Co. teamed up with Dutch and French banks to use blockchain in the agricultural commodity trade. A blockchain platform was used to sell a cargo of soybeans to Shandong Bohi Industry Co., based in China, Bloomberg reported. Cryptocurrency in the freight industry is not exactly news: a project called Blockfreight uses both the Bitcoin and the Ethereum blockchain while also utilizing the InterPlanetary File System protocol within the global supply chain. Blockfreight’s CEO Julian Smith said for news.bitcoin.com that he “believes supply chain dealers won’t even know bitcoin will be running beneath the system.”",2018-01-26
" After an American independent financial ratings agency Weiss published their long-awaited ratings of cryptocurrencies, many people were disappointed and thus taken to various forums to vent their frustration. The reviews online are overwhelmingly negative; however, it must not be forgotten that the purpose of these ratings is to “help protect investors from risk, while leading them to the most sustainable, robust cryptocurrencies”, as it says in their statement on why Bitcoin is not an A. The Weiss ratings placed ethereum and EOS cryptocurrencies ahead of bitcoin, as reported by Cryptonews.com today. No currency garnered a top score of A, but there were B ratings for both ethereum and EOS, with bitcoin receiving a “fair” rating of C+. Weiss claimed bitcoin “falls short in two important areas: risk and technology,” although it admitted bitcoin was strong in terms of adoption and branding.  Reddit, an American news aggregation and discussion website, user u/CrzyJek has taken to the popular r/cryptocurrency subreddit to explain why Weiss ratings “is a sham and complete utter garbage”. The user cites his sources diligently, quoting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in their prosecutions of Weiss for “fraudulent, misleading statements, as well as engaging in insider pump & dump though their listings”.  Those sources were a cease and desist letter from 2006, and an order approving distribution plan from 2009. He concludes that, “Weiss ratings is a long standing pump & dump operation who makes propitious picks based largely on which securities the owners currently hold, and who, prima facia [sic], had a few years of self-proclaimed legitimacy, yet were later exposed as shilling their own picks to pump their stocks.” Other users on the same subreddit urge against taking the Weiss ratings seriously: “If the reports are freely available read them and analyze their findings but don't take them as gospel. Give them a credibility level similar to a well researched blog post [...] I suspect that [the reports] are mostly a PR stunt to increase the visibility of Weiss Ratings and maybe sell some subscriptions/reports.” Reddit User u/atworkmeir proposes to “take it with several grains of salt. Maybe the whole shaker.” As this is the first cryptocurrency rating available, it must be taken into consideration that perhaps, Weiss holds the cryptocurrency market to the same standards as the stock market, even though they are not strictly comparable, at least for the moment. Weiss said, “Ratings are not a science. They are, and always will be, a work in progress.” In addition to the negative reviews, Weiss has been hit with a spate of cyberattacks it says came “from Korea”, also as reported by Cryptonews.com.",2018-01-25
" Sander Wuyts, a PhD student from the University of Antwerp, has won the DNA Storage Bitcoin Challenge, issued by Nick Goldman of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) in 2015, the Institute reports. However, Wuyts is skeptical as to the value of Bitcoin. “I didn’t win thousands of euros, I won one Bitcoin,” he says. “I will probably cash it out, because I have my doubts about the long-term value of this cryptocurrency”. One of his followers on Twitter reacted to this: 
“You will regret it a lot in the future if you sell it. Look at it this way: it is worth less than 10k now. That's just a few months of pay for your level of education. It's meaningless. But what if you are wrong about its future? Then it will make a difference”.  The challenge had been issued on January 21, 2015, at a World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland. The deadline was to be January 21, 2018 - exactly three years later. In that time, the price of Bitcoin increased from USD 230 to c. USD 10,000, as at the press time. At the meeting, Goldman explained a new method of storing digital information in DNA. To prove the merit of this, Goldman distributed test tubes containing samples of DNA encoding one Bitcoin to the audience (and subsequently posted samples to people who requested them). The first person to read the DNA and decode the files it contained could take possession of the Bitcoin. According to the Institute, “all they needed was the sample, access to a DNA sequencing machine and a grasp of how the code works.” Wuyts, the PhD student who won the challenge, only started working on it after seeing a tweet about the deadline in early December 2017. The hard work paid off with only a week to go before time was up: on January 16, he published a blog post on cracking the code, with step-by-step, highly technical explanations. You can watch the full speech from the WEF meeting in 2015 on this link.",2018-01-24
" Bitcoin is an excellent idea that fulfills the needs of the complex system, not because it is a cryptocurrency, but precisely because it has no owner, no authority that can decide on its fate, writes the famous essayist, scholar, and risk analyst Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his foreword to the book by Saifedean Ammous. Bitcoin is owned by the crowd, its users and it has now a track record of several years, enough for it to be “an animal in its own right”, according to Taleb.  The problem with centralized currency and its subsequent impact as Taleb sees it is that, “not only the expert is not an expert, but he doesn’t know it. That previous Federal Reserve bosses, Greenspan and Bernanke, had little grasp of empirical reality is something we only discovered a bit too late [...] which is why we need to be careful on who to endow with centralized macro decisions.” Taleb further concludes that Bitcoin’s structural design is what could make “a zero intelligence crowd [work] better than a Soviet-style management composed to maximally intelligent humans.”  He does not reject the notion that Bitcoin might fail - but is positive in his belief that, should it fail, we, as a society, would simply invent an improved version as an insurance against “an Orwellian future.”",2018-01-23
" Bitcoin and other major digital currencies came under renewed selling pressure after South Korea’s decision to ban anonymous cryptocurrency trading. The Financial Services Commission in South Korea took a major step and introduced a new rule for cryptocurrency transactions and trading. They banned the use of anonymous bank accounts for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies related trading and transactions.  Speaking at the government complex in Seoul, South Korea, South Korea's Financial Services Commission vice Chair, Kim Yong-Beom, stated that a new system will be introduced soon, which will enable local banks to stop anonymous transactions related to bitcoin trading.  He added that “cryptocurrency exchanges that are in danger of being exploited for money laundering will be thrown out of the market”.  It means these steps will help regulatory firms to prevent money laundering criminal activities in South Korea using bitcoins and cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin price was down roughly 11.88% to USD 10,344. Other major cryptocurrencies also declined sharply, including ether and ripple. ETH traded lower by 12.12% to USD 950. It is now trading below the USD 980 support level and it may continue to decline in the near future. 
The next major support in ETH/USD is at USD 920. Similarly, XRP was down 8.2% to USD 1.24 and is currently holding the USD 1.20 support. Should there be a break below the USD 1.20 support, ripple price could test the USD 1.10 level. Recently in the US, Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Bob Menendez (D-NJ) cautioned Trump administration on Venezuelan Regime's 'petro' cryptocurrency plans. In anopen letter to Secretary Mnuchin, they mentioned: “As such, we are concerned that a cryptocurrency could provide Maduro a mechanism by which to make payments to foreign lenders and bondholders in the United States, actions that would clearly thwart the intent of U.S.-imposed sanctions.” One of the five questions asked by Senators was “Does the Department have effective enforcement mechanisms to follow and counter the use of cryptocurrencies?” Clearly, there is a lot happening in the cryptocurrency arena, putting a lot of pressure on bitcoin price below the USD 11,000 level. Going forward, BTC/USD could test the USD 10,000 level if the current market sentiment fails to ease in the short term.",2018-01-23
" DECO, the Portuguese Association for Consumer Protection, recently protested against Banco Santander Totta S.A., Portugal’s fourth largest bank, for blocking a client’s transfers on the grounds they were related to cryptocurrency. When João Nogueira, an associate of DECO, decided he wanted to invest in cryptocurrency, he went through all the steps required to connect his bank account to his exchange platform account, only to find out his bank was blocking him from making any cryptocurrency related transactions. After some back-and-forth where Nogueira insisted on clarification, it came to light that this was a matter of policy for the bank, despite not having any known legal basis to support its actions. The Portuguese central bank, Banco de Portugal, previously stated that they have issued no guidelines instructing banks to prevent money transfers to cryptocurrency exchange accounts. DECO has since reached out to six other Portuguese banks to ascertain whether they have any limitations set in place on this sort of transaction. Only one, Novo Banco, has so far answered, stating that they currently have no restrictions related to these operations. Earlier this month, Publico reported that the country will be charging no fees on crypto-related profits, as there is no framework in Portuguese law to consider them taxable. The authorities concluded that ""the trading of cryptocurrency is not taxable under Portuguese tax law, unless by its habitual nature it constitutes the professional or business activity of the taxpayer"".",2018-01-22
" Following the famous all-time high of Bitcoin on December 15th, 2017, even the last few people who had been living under various rocks have finally heard about cryptocurrency. Many have decided they wanted in. It seems like the perfect way to get rich – almost zero work included, just buy at the dip and sell at the peak. Why didn't I think of that? I've known all about crypto for ages now! Because as they say, hindsight is 20/20, and while it may not be too late to start investing, you’re afraid that the bubble will still burst. Regardless of whether you're a seasoned veteran or a noob in crypto, you must be wondering what causes its market fluctuations. Short answer: if we knew for sure, we'd all be rich. I wouldn't be writing this article because I'd be busy hiding this sort of knowledge from the public, faking my own death and moving to the Azores. The long answer is in this article. The terms value and price may be used interchangeably here, both denoting the exchange rate of cryptocurrency in relation to another (generally fiat) currency. Governments
While the selling point of cryptocurrency is decentralization, it would be wrong to assume that governments have nothing to do with crypto price. Every time the (generally Orwellian) restrictions on the use of crypto are imposed in a country, prices change drastically within – the effect on prices in the world depends on which country we are talking about. While we, most likely, wouldn't feel the difference of a tiny country opting out of the game, the prices for locals would skyrocket. On the other hand, China banning Bitcoin has backfired on them, with the prices rising significantly within only a few days.  Security Breaches
Obvious though it is, security is a huge factor. When Bitcoin Gold was reported to be compromised in November, 2017, they were lucky to find that their prices had fallen by less than 7%. However, Bitcoin hadn't fared that well in 2014, after the discovery of the Heartbleed bug: prices fell 10% within the next month, and the world held its breath even when the breach was reported fixed. Paradoxically, though, crypto often bounces back or even rises instead of falling at all; with such expensive feedback, security is often improved in a surprisingly short time and leaks are patched – unless the currency has died for good. More is sometimes less
If you are among the select few lucky enough to have, for example, Bitcoin holdings above around USD 10 million,  it may prove challenging to exchange your BTC to a fiat currency without disrupting the market. This is caused by the fact that Bitcoin has not spread enough on the mass market yet – a fact that is likely to be amended soon enough. To a certain extent, this contributes to Bitcoin volatility, and is applicable to other cryptocurrencies as well. Although small, this factor shows the need for the mass market adoption of cryptocurrency through a new lens.  Public Perception
During and after the Mt. Gox, a crypto exchange, fiasco in 2014, prices plummeted in general, not to mention the crash on Mt. Gox itself – hardly unexpected, because who wants to be fooled like that? This goes both ways: Ripple increased in price 37,000% by the end of 2017, thanks to the interest of big-name banks and payment processing services – its target audience. Privacy and security also remained a concern in the eyes of the public, thanks to which in 2017, Monero saw a 2,531% value increase. For a decentralized currency that strives to be from the people to the people, the scrutiny of its audience is bound to be a major, possibly even the largest, factor in its market price. Panic Selling
We have all been there – you see prices increasing, everyone is talking about cryptocurrencies, and you think to yourself, “I really want to be part of this!” Sure, many of us stopped there (because we were scared of losing money), but luckily not all. Many more bought their preferred currency and waited for it to skyrocket. It happened to others, right? But we want quick profits! As soon as the price starts falling, we panic, thinking we won’t be able to break even at the very least, and sell it all. Now we’re comically wiping our brows and thinking we just barely made it out – until next week, the prices rise again...
Still, this sort of dumping can and will drop the prices even further very quickly. A number of cryptocurrencies has died this way, because they can’t make the laborious rise again. And while this is a known factor, not everyone agrees it’s as big as it seems to be. Market Manipulation
Luke Martin, blockchain startup investor and advisor, considers the forces behind the market fluctuations more sinister than most. „What if its [sic] not 'noobs' dumping alts, but its [sic] that speculators/MMs are moving their bids lower? Less liquidity from buyers. That would shift down the price of alts too... The market may be smarter than you think“, reads a recent tweet. And sure, if I refuse to pay the price you’re asking for, and the next person does the same, with enough encouragement, you will be forced to lower the price if you still want to sell.
Another noteworthy market manipulation tactic is ""pump and dump"", a decades-old scheme (made popular by the Wolf of Wall Street where a group of individuals (or, increasingly often, bots work together to buy a relatively unknown cryptocurrency simultaneously, causing the price to inflate through demand – and sell it off to eager investors, who are fooled by the rising price. The aforementioned individuals make off with the money, while the investors are left wondering where the other interested parties are. (Hint: there never were any).
___________ Conclusion With this breakneck pace of changes, improvements and reactions concerning cryptocurrency, its price will remain volatile at least over the next few years. Singling out the reasons for its fluctuations helps us understand them better, even though no combination of them is a fool-proof cheat-sheet for getting rich on crypto investments. In this regard, cryptocurrency is no different than any other investment that may rise or fall beyond belief in as short a time as 24 hours. The only safe way to hold on to your money is to remain behind the stage and watch without participating. But where’s the fun in that?",2018-01-19
" A leading financial analyst believes that Bitcoin is not the cryptocurrency of the future, and will be overtaken by competitors such as Ripple and ethereum, comparing the current market leader to defunct social media platforms. Benjamin Quinlan, CEO and Managing Partner of his own consultancy, Quinlan & Associates, and formerly a leading strategist for Deutsche Bank, said that the recent fall in the price of Bitcoin is more than just a temporary blip, and indeed the Hong Kong-based banker believes that the cryptocurrency's valuation will be closer to USD 800 by 2020. ""It's a very emotional topic, where Bitcoin is and where it's going to go,"" explained Quinlan, talking to Bloomberg. The rapid fall in the valuation of Bitcoin in recent days has shaken many investors, and raised questions about its durability. ""The most recent example, with the price swings in Bitcoin, reinforce the fact that its core purpose as a medium of exchange or a currency is potentially threatened by the fact that its price volatility is just so extreme."" ""You add in additional things like transaction times are relatively slow, transaction charges, though it's technically meant to be free, are quite high, and it really thwarts the case that it's meant to be a potential currency."" Quinlan was more positive about the future for newer cryptocurrencies, with what he views as a greater inherent versatility than Bitcoin. ""Cryptocurrencies with potential applications, and utilities, such as Ethereum - smart contracts can be built on top of it, decentralized applications - Bitcoin in its current form can't do that. Other cryptocurrencies have anonymity functions and privacy that far surpasses the level of Bitcoin, and some have transaction processing times that far surpass Bitcoin."" Quinlan, who enjoys a successful parallel career in Kong Kong as a stand-up comedian, drew parallels with the early days of social media. ""There are various social media players - there are players that started out initially when the various social media platforms came about, but due to the fact that they were not technologically as advanced as competitors that came in, they really fell out of favor with investors."" Many will remember MySpace, and how it was superseded by Facebook, and that may be a change that we are about to see in the world of cryptocurrencies.",2018-01-19
" On December 10, 2017, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), one of the leading derivatives exchanges in the US officially launched the trading of bitcoin futures contracts. A week later, on December 17, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange followed suit and also launched bitcoin futures on its exchange after the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approved the new financial product.  The announcement of bitcoin futures coming to two leading U.S. derivative exchanges sparked bitcoin’s incredible year-end rally that saw the price of bitcoin hit its 2017 high of USD 20,000 in mid-December, driven by the potential new investor funds that can now flow into bitcoin as both institutional investors and private investors are now able to bet on the price of bitcoin through a regulated investment vehicle.   What are Bitcoin Futures Contracts? Futures contracts, also referred to as futures, are standardized exchange-traded financial derivatives that provide an agreement between a buyer and a seller to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a predefined date. 
Each futures contract represents a specific amount of the underlying asset and futures can be either cash settled or come with physical delivery. In the case of bitcoin futures, the underlying asset is the digital currency bitcoin.  How Do You Trade Bitcoin Futures? To trade bitcoin futures on the CME or the CBOE as a private investor, you need an account with a brokerage that offers bitcoin futures trading. As for January of 2018, Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade, and Ally Financial offer this to their clients but more brokerages are expected to follow suit. Once you are registered with a broker that allows you to trade bitcoin futures you can buy them online in the same fashion that you would buy futures on commodities like gold, silver or oil. If you believe that the price of bitcoin will hit USD 20,000 by mid-February, you could purchase a CBOE Feb 17 XBT futures contract at USD 15,000. If by February 14, 2018, when the contract expires, the price is at USD 20,000, you will have made a profit of USD 5,000. This profit could be higher depending on the leverage that your broker can provide you with. Of course, you can also close out your trade ahead of the expiry date if you want to take profit earlier. However, if during the time of the contract the value drops, your broker will ask you to top up your margin account to ensure you can cover potential losses from the trade. If you fail to top up your maintenance margin account when you receive a margin call, your trade will be closed out for you by your broker.  Due to the added leverage that futures bring, they are considered a much riskier investment than stocks and bonds.  However, futures can also be used to hedge investment risk by entering into a short position. This was actually the original idea of commodity futures when they were introduced for farmers to hedge their market risk. For example, if a farmer knows he will raise 10,000 bushels of corn, he can short sell one futures contract for corn (assuming one contract covers 10,000 bushels of corn) at a specific price with the expiry set to the time when he plans on selling his corn. If the price of corn should drop before the farmer can sell his corn, this loss is offset by the gains on the short futures contract. In effect, commodity futures allow producers to lock in the price at which they want to sell their product.  CME vs CBOE Bitcoin Futures Futures are standardized exchange-traded financial products. However, futures contract do differ from exchange to exchange. That means you can only trade CME bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and CBOE bitcoin futures only on the CBOE.  While the two bitcoin futures contracts trade in the same way from a technical point of view, they have the following key differences:  CME bitcoin futures have the ticker ‘BTC’, have a contract unit of five bitcoins and 35% initial margin is needed to place a trade. CBOE bitcoin futures, on the other hand, have the ticker ‘XBT’, their contract unit is one bitcoin, and the margin requirement is 44%.  Both futures contracts are in US dollar and are cash settled, which means no bitcoin are exchanged at the end of the contract - only the cash difference. Also, both contracts have the three closest months listed as contract expiry dates.  If you are entirely new to futures trading, you can start out practicing using the CME’s bitcoin futures trading simulator before you place your first trade with your broker.  Bitcoin Futures - The Early Days When bitcoin futures started to trade on the CBOE on December 10, 2017, the price rallied as investors were confident that the opening up of bitcoin to institutional investors in this format would bring new money into the asset class. On the exchange itself, however, trading volumes of bitcoin futures remained comparatively low and was reportedly largely dominated by retail investors[/URL] as institutional market participants were concerned about the clearing of these new futures.  Less than USD 10 million worth of bitcoin futures were traded on the CBOE in the first hour of trading while at the same time, the popular bitcoin exchange Bitfinex traded around USD 170 million worth of bitcoin.  Bitcoin futures trading volumes have remained comparatively low at both the CME and the CBOE. At both exchanges, the January expiry contract is the most popular and is experiencing the most trading volume while February and March contracts are seeing very little trading action.  Judging by the current rate, it looks like it will take a few more months before bitcoin futures will take up a larger share of trading at the CME and CBOE. This is most likely the case as the majority of large investment houses are still assessing the risks of gaining exposure to a decentralized digital currency such as bitcoin.",2018-01-18
" The payment card company Visa would not be processing transactions that are cryptocurrency-based, told Visa CEO Alfred Kelly in an interview with CNBC. He said he didn’t see Bitcoin as a “payment system player”. ""My take is that Bitcoin is much more today a commodity that somebody could invest in; and honestly, somewhat of a speculative commodity,"" said Kelly. This goes hand-in-hand with the recent veto on cryptocurrency cards; earlier this month, Visa subsidiary Wavecrest withdrew its service seemingly overnight, leaving crypto card issuers struggling to find alternative solutions. And while Visa remains tight-lipped about the reasons for the veto, offering only that it was due to “continued non-compliance with our operating rules”, Wirex CEO Pavel Matveev told Bitcoin News that, “Wavecrest have been violating Visa rules for months…it’s 100% Wavecrest’s fault and they knew it was coming a couple of months ago.” Back in 2015, Fortune published an article about the stance of Visa and MasterCard towards Bitcoin, especially noting their seeming reluctance to throw in with cryptocurrency, instead expressing their interest in the underlying blockchain technology. The CEO’s current stance on Bitcoin only serves to support this existing speculation. In light of this latest unequivocal rejection of cryptocurrency, any companies intent on bridging the gap between crypto and fiat currency will have to look for other ways, knowing that no support will be forthcoming from either Visa or any of its subsidiaries.",2018-01-18
" China, which once dominated the global Bitcoin markets, continues its efforts to stamp out crypto-trading within its borders.  Following up on a 2017 nationwide ban on cryptocurrency-to-fiat exchanges and initial coin offerings (ICOs) , a senior Chinese banking official is now supporting the prohibition of additional services related to and involved with crypto-trading, Reuters reported, citing a memo outlining a government meeting in early January.  Vice Governor Pan Gongsheng of China’s central bank, The People's Bank of China (PBOC), said the government would implement additional regulations to shut down branches of the cryptocurrency industry including settlement providers, market-makers, guarantors, peer-to-peer lending vehicles, alternative trading platforms and cryptocurrency wallets, according to the report.  Moreover, Pan suggested local governments heighten their monitoring of mining energy consumption and use electricity price, taxes, and land use and environmental regulations as tools to guide the mines “toward an orderly exit.” China is currently a world leader in cryptocurrency mining because of its low energy prices. In late 2017, Pan famously predicted the death of Bitcoin, saying, “There is only one thing left to do: Sit by the river bank and see Bitcoin’s body pass by one day.” Since the recent crackdown on the crypto-sphere, major Chinese exchanges such as OKEx and Huobi Pro have redirected their business development into over-the-counter (OTC) trading, which typically uses private dealers rather than centralized exchanges, as well as overseas crypto-to-crypto venues. Pan feels websites and apps that facilitate these practices and/or help people move money overseas should be sanctioned.  Meanwhile, some major Chinese mining groups are now moving to the U.S., Canada or Iceland. BTC.Top, the third-largest mining pool, is opening a new location in Canada, according to media reports.",2018-01-16
" According to all data, 2017 is the year of the cryptocurrency - which is when it saw the largest spike in search traffic, transactions, public interest and of course prices. Those saying that Bitcoin, but also other cryptocurrencies, are a bubble come a dime a dozen.  Although crypto aficionados will vehemently deny the possibility of a bubble, it remains hard to know. There is, after all, only one way for cryptocurrencies to not pop: mass adoption. Luckily for the industry, most of our popular coins, led by Bitcoin and Ethereum, are already on the right path. Bitcoinsaltcoins.com points out the proof to this through four distinct trends. Steady traffic growth A total market cap of USD 150 billion in the case of Bitcoin and USD 69 billion for Ethereum vouch for this trend. Google Trends data also proves people’s interest in the young industry, given that everybody wants to learn more about it through googling. There was a significant correlation between search traffic and prices, although correlation does not always equal causation. In short, after a while, the network size of Bitcoin may become too big to fail - there will always be somebody interested in it, at least in terms of a speculative asset. This may not be the endgame for most early investors who would like to see Bitcoin grow into an accepted currency, but at least it is a guarantee against failure. Consumer-friendly applications Following the ever-increasing wave of initial coin offerings (ICOs), new features, mostly on the blockchain, are also trying to find a place in the industry. What’s possibly the best feature of ICOs and the projects they are representing is the fact that they are getting increasingly more user-friendly. Growth from developer-oriented apps and tokens towards people without as much understanding of even computer sciences, let alone anything else, may be the shift needed for mass adoption. Many of these projects are looking for ways to create an often decentralized environment (unless specified differently) for what they want to do. Some projects are looking for ways to bring more gender equality into this glaringly male-dominated field; others are simply creating a place for game developers to make games, eliminating the bias of centralized market places and fundraising platforms. Increased public awareness How many people do you know that haven’t heard the term Bitcoin? It has swiftly grown from a niche field to a household name. Although increased public awareness is not an exact, measurable metric, it can be intuitively observed - not very many people are going to look at you bewildered when you mention crypto. Educating people is also an important aspect of awareness, as this is a new frontier that everyone is naturally scared of. However, the rapid development of technology within the past few decades has already taught people to be more accepting of new things - for example, the internet wasn’t so bad after all, right? Educating people about blockchain and cryptocurrency is the only surefire way to have them look for possibilities rather than weaknesses in the industry. Industry-wide growth There is a term in the world of forecasting called “cone of uncertainty,” used by experts to determine a project’s chances of reaching a milestone based on previously accomplished milestones. Most of Bitcoin’s future milestones are based on continued growth, while Ether and other tokens will likely follow Bitcoin’s expansion pattern. This has already been proven to be the case: whenever Bitcoin rose, so did the others - and the same was true for the prices falling. These metrics are far from being conclusive, but are doing a good enough job of it. As the industry grows, it continues to establish the model for cryptocurrencies and indicates a greater likelihood of reaching the final milestone of mass adoption. Although the general consensus of cryptocurrencies being volatile still stands (as does the old, “don’t invest more than you can afford to lose”), the industry is moving into mass adoption territory quickly and with few hiccups - other than the general confusion regarding potential regulation. But as Jim Rohn, an American entrepreneur, author and motivational speaker, would put it, “If you are not willing to risk the usual, you will have to settle for the ordinary.”",2018-01-03
